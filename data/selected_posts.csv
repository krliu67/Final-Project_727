"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

Please feel free to send us your thoughts at [email] or on our FB page.

Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

Please feel free to send us your thoughts at [email] or on our FB page.

"2011-05-18",1305696563,"The 3 reforms I believe could fix most of our nation's problems."," - State Homes:  Dormitory-style housing where anyone, regardless of income, can find a private, safe place, to sleep, and eat.  Residents will be required to contribute through a special tax on all income (until such a time as the cost of their housing has been repaid, adjusted for inflation) and must provide unpaid service to their building (i.e. security, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, etc.).  Individuals who refuse to contribute will be denied housing.  State Homes can also provide the utility of emergency shelters for the displaced, those escaping domestic violence, the homeless, etc.  These would, in no way, be luxurious -- what I envision would more closely resemble a prison cell (e.g. 7' x 7' rooms) than a condo, and the food would be along the lines of protein bars -- the point would be to provide a safety net which encourages people to improve their condition, without forcing them onto the street.

 - State Schools:  We already provide K-12 education for all, regardless of citizenship.  For those who can prove citizenship, we should extend this structure to include higher education and trade education.  This taxpayer-funded education should not be compulsory and admission should be based on merit.  As opposed to traditional schools which encourage seemingly frivolous educations (e.g. majors with no real market value, ""mickey mouse"" electives, etc.), State schools should focus on skills which are useful to society, and admission to professional programs should be based on projected market demand (i.e. if we expect to need X physicians, only something like 1.25X students should be admitted).  Students who attend a State School, shall be required to pay a special tax on all income, for the entirety of their professional careers.  For certain professions where there is a distinct societal need, but a lack of interest on the part of students, this tax can be waived in full or in part to provide an incentive for students.

 - State Care:  We already provide medicare/medicaid, however these programs are very expensive and do not ensure all citizens have access to necessary medical care.  We can expand medicare to cover all and significantly reduce costs by utilizing State Schools.  Most providers can be hired from the pool of State School graduates.  We can then waive education-tax repayment for those who agree to remain in the employ of the state for X years.  Accordingly, we can pay a fair wage, but a wage which is significantly less than current (2011) prevailing wages for physicians/etc.  With regards to pharmaceuticals and durable medical equipment, we can encourage State Schools to research new drugs/DME, but providing assistance WRT testing.  Drugs/DME discovered could then be licensed out to manufacturers (reducing the cost as they are not doing the research/testing and do not carry such liability) with the school guaranteed a predetermined percentage (I'm thinking around 5%) of the manufacturer's profit.  Manufacturers who go this route can be given a ""profit cap"", whereby they can only mark up the product so much.  After a particular period of time (say 10 years), the drug/DME could then fall into the public domain.  Through this, we can significantly reduce the costs of medical care *while* encouraging innovation.

The homes, schools, and care programs could serve to increase the bargaining power of both American workers and consumers while encouraging competition in private enterprise.  If an individual doesn't have to fear homelessness, they can resign from a particularly abusive employer.  If the cost of higher education isn't so exorbitant, employees can be paid less and still retain a decent standard of living.  Without a captive market, housing prices would drop significantly, further reducing the need for such high salaries in the US, making us more competitive with foreign nations.  Existing industries would need to adapt themselves (e.g. health insurers would need to focus on luxury care, as would private hospitals, etc.), but it doesn't have to put them out of business...unless they refuse to adapt themselves.  And I believe this could also provide a hedge against inflation (i.e. as individuals earn less, and the cost of production drops, consumer prices will drop as well).","politics",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hdzlp/the_3_reforms_i_believe_could_fix_most_of_our/","The 3 reforms I believe could fix most of our nation's problems.-- - State Homes:  Dormitory-style housing where anyone, regardless of income, can find a private, safe place, to sleep, and eat.

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

**Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )**

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  in clear conflict with this Courts decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.'

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

"2020-02-08",1581201509,"Appeals court holds university liable for ineffective Title IX policies","A federal court opinion could put the policies and procedures of colleges and universities in California and the western U.S. under a microscope for their ability to prevent sexual assault.

An institution can be held liable for pre-assault claims, which allege that its policies for enforcing Title IX are inadequate, create an environment of heightened risk of sexual misconduct and lead a complainant to be harassed or assaulted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared in a ruling Thursday. The federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex at institutions that receive federal funding and requires them to investigate reports of sexual misconduct 

Three former students who allege they were assaulted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 initially brought a case against the University of California systems Board of Regents in 2015 for Berkeley's handling of their individual complaints. When the case was dismissed in district court, the women appealed.

While many of the recent federal court decisions on Title IX have focused on the rights of respondents, the Ninth Circuit opinion is a big win for victims advocates, especially if other appeals courts follow suit, said Peter Lake, director of the Law Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.

The ruling by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circult referenced a 2014 California State Auditor report of Berkeleys processes under Title IX. The report found that from 2009 to 2013, Berkeley did not notify or give regular updates to parties involved in investigations of sexual misconduct, did not complete investigations in a timely manner and did not sufficiently educate staff and students on sexual misconduct prevention, which led cases to be mishandled and compromised student safety, according to the Ninth Circuit opinion.

Berkeleys use of an early resolution process that addressed complaints of sexual assault without formal investigations also came under fire in the courts opinion. It is standard for institutions to pursue early resolution or mediation between the complainant and respondent only in cases of sexual harassment and when both parties are in agreement, said Jake Sapp, deputy Title IX coordinator and compliance officer at Austin College, in Texas.

The former Berkeley students asserted that only two of the 500 cases of sexual misconduct reported to the university in 2012 were resolved in a formal process and that they were coerced into early resolution by the university. This was allegedly done so Berkeley did not have to report assaults under the Clery Act, which requires institutions to disclose crimes on their campuses, according to the students lawsuit.

Berkeley was ordered by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to revise its Title IX policies after a 2014 investigation by the agency. The university subsequently enacted many new policies, procedures and services over the last few years, according to a February 2018 statement from the university.

But the opinion could open other colleges and universities in the California system and elsewhere in the states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- to lawsuits that challenge the effectiveness of their Title IX policies, Lake said.

Contrary to other federal court opinions that address an institutions deliberate indifference to or inaction on a report of sexual misconduct after the fact, the Ninth Circuits opinion discusses what is known as before theory, Lake said.

If your state system does some analysis and finds inadequacies in terms of response, thats something that they will take more seriously, Lake said. This is a different kind of argument: that the policies themselves shut the door before anyone is able to provide notice.

The door is now open for plaintiffs to argue before theory in the Ninth Circuit. The opinion creates a broader standard than a similar case, Simpson v. University of Colorado, which said that colleges can be liable if there is knowledge of sexual misconduct in a specific program, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators. That case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado.

""It may be easier to establish a causal link between a schools policy of deliberate indifference and the plaintiffs harassment when the heightened risk of harassment exists in a specific program,"" the Ninth Circuit opinion said. ""But we will not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff could adequately allege causation even when a schools policy of deliberate indifference extends to sexual misconduct occurring across campus.""

The Ninth Circuit ruling did note that Title IX does not require California to purge its campus of sexual misconduct to avoid liability and that a university is not responsible for guaranteeing the good behavior of its students.

Sokolow believes most of the higher education institutions in California already hold a high standard for Title IX processes and will be unsurprised by this progressive opinion in the Ninth Circuit. But colleges and universities elsewhere might now look more closely at their admissions policies for special admits or transfer students, such as athletic scholarship recipients, for histories of sexual misconduct.

Its going to not only put individuals in the Ninth Circuit on alert but Title IX administrators across the nation, Sapp said.

Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who represents students accused of sexual assault, said the hope is that colleges do not become overly concerned with pre-assault claims and pursue cases that are not strong enough for investigation and disciplinary measures against accused students.

The hope is that universities will heed this and take measures to ensure that both Title IX complainants and respondents are treated fairly, equitably and given the due process protections that they deserve, Miltenberg wrote in an email.

The case will now return to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide whether to proceed with the claims against the Board of Regents based on the appeals courts new standard.

"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

They Say They Need It.--Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.",23

**Backstory**: 
 Sometime last fall semester (actually I could say it started in the spring of 2011 in a lot of ways), out of nowhere I developed gastrointestinal problems. At first the effects were pretty mild--I missed class some mornings and had episodes of going to the bathroom after dinner, but overall it wasn't too bad. I went to the doctor who told me it was due to smoking, coffee and anxiety, so I quit smoking and I quit coffee and went on with life. Still nothing changed  so I sucked it up and went on with life because I didn't have time to deal with it. Slowly but surely my symptoms began worsening. I missed more class. I started having to visit the bathroom during exams. I started having painful cramps throughout my entire abdomen and back to the point that I would be unable to leave me house. 

By early spring semester the effects had become so severe that my attendance dropped by 50% and I had trouble performing on exams. During one of my thermal exams I had to leave the room 19 times. Yes, **19 times**. This, of course, led to some suspicion and interrogation, but I was very embarrassed about my conditions so I never mentioned it, and just told the prof I had a stomach bug.

This spring was also the spring my research took off. Days I stayed home due to not being able to leave the bathroom, I dragged my computer in with me and did as much work as I could. This led to me winning a few awards and a spot at an international math conference in march. **Oh god, this was the worst experience for me**. I did well at the conference, but only because I self medicated, using 3x the recommended dose of over the counter medicine. This did not dull the pain, though. I continued on because I wanted to, and I had to. It's my dream to be a physicist, and sure it sucks to have this condition, but I made it through and I did a damn good job. 

Of course, at this conference a prof in our group noticed my frequent bathroom trips and told me I should seek out help because I could have celiacs disease (which my grandmother has). Upon my return to campus, as it was the end of the semester, I did just that. This led to a summer of blood tests, colonoscopies and medicinal cocktails. The doctors found nothing. No one knows what's wrong with me (though they prescribed me $1000/mo medicine with possibly fatal side effects...). I decided to take my exam results and visit a campus medical professional who put me on my current miracle medicine.  She furthermore advised me to go to the student disability center, which I did. As of this fall I am officially documented by my educational institution, with a folder full of examination results and my complaints.

So this brings us to now. Over the summer I adopted a very strict diet and have adhered to my prescribed medicine. I have also taken up cycling. These things in combination have basically eliminated my symptoms, restoring my ability to attend and preform in class. I still experience the intense cramping, though, at unpredictable times, especially if I am generally stressed or have come into contact with unagreeable food. 

About 1/3 of the way through my subject GRE, I reached to take my medicine from my bag (which I was told I could have). I was immediately yelled at by the proctor and I was not permitted to take my medication. Not ten minutes later, the anxiety got to me and my stomach began to cramp and I had a very difficult time concentrating. The scores have not come back yet, but I am not expecting anything wonderful. 

I took the general GRE, and I became very stressed out because they told me I would have to sign out (a 3-5 minute process) if I wanted a sip of water or to use the bathroom. This pretty much immediately made my stomach cramp. As this exam is 4 hours long, one can imagine that I didn't fair well. My scores are pitiful for my goals (75% in quant and 78% verbal 4 writing), I am trying to get into a top ten school in mathematical science... and my verbal score is HIGHER than my quant. 

You might ask, well, why didn't you sign up for the accommodated GRE? Well- I tried. I didn't know about my qualifications for this until september. I made an appointment with my doctor, filled out the forms and everything. There was a small error on the application and it was rejected two weeks before my test date. It takes two weeks to get an appointment with my doctor. There was no chance after that, and I did my best to medicate and meditate. Honestly, I didn't expect to have the issues I did. I have been doing pretty fine on in class examinations. It turns out not having access to water and a restroom in a 3+ hour long exam takes a serious freaking toll on me. C'est la vie.


So the net effect of this disease has taken one A to an A- and two A's to B+'s (in a physics speech class and thermal). It has likely obliterated my subject GRE score. It put me at a 75th percentile for quantitative reasoning, despite having a 4.0 in my applied math major (I doubled). 

Its just heart breaking to me. I just worked my ass off for years to have a great transcript, nearly 4.0's in both majors (not in my cume though =/), excellent research and likely a publication in the near future, and it will ALL be tanked over some crummy exams. I really need to counteract this in a sincere way. Can someone please help me?

"2023-01-13",1673569014,"Seeking Advice for Econ PhD Route","Hey folks,

I am seeking advice on whether I should apply for Econ PhDs or seek a different field based on my academic background, goals, and current situation. I've read a couple similar posts in this community and others, but hopefully people with experience can offer advice tailored to my particular background.

I majored in Economics with a math focus as an undergraduate (about 3.7 gpa), so I have experience in calc 1-3, linear algebra, and a prerequisite calc proofs class for real analysis. It is worth mentioning, however, that I have not taken real analysis, and I don't know if this significantly bars me from admission to most programs. I have scored a 167 on the math GRE after my second attempt. I have finished a master's degree in sociology (about 3.9 gpa), but realized that the more mathematical/policy approach to economics more closely suited my research interests.

I am motivated to get a PhD because I am driven both by the prospect of research and teaching. I envision a rewarding career as one in which I can learn about concepts that interest me, contribute to society's understanding of economic topics, and advance the field.

I currently work in a fairly well-paying job doing IT consulting work, but I feel like my motivation is far stronger toward learning more about society and policy from an economic perspective.

Regarding career goals, I would love a professorship that enabled me to balance teaching, researching, and writing about my interests on the side.

I did not reach out to any professors at these schools ahead of applying, and I'm not sure how much this hurt my applications.

Here are my questions:

1. Based on my interests and goals, does a PhD in economics sound like something you would recommend pursuing?
2. How important is attending a top-ranked school given the goals I outlined? What is the lowest rank you would recommend applying to?
3. What would you recommend doing differently to increase my chances of acceptance if I apply again?
4. Do I have to take real analysis to have a decent shot?

I am seeking advice on whether I should apply for Econ PhDs or seek a different field based on my academic background, goals, and current situation. I've read a couple similar posts in this community and others, but hopefully people with experience can offer advice tailored to my particular background.

I majored in Economics with a math focus as an undergraduate (about 3.7 gpa), so I have experience in calc 1-3, linear algebra, and a prerequisite calc proofs class for real analysis. It is worth mentioning, however, that I have not taken real analysis, and I don't know if this significantly bars me from admission to most programs. I have scored a 167 on the math GRE after my second attempt. I have finished a master's degree in sociology (about 3.9 gpa), but realized that the more mathematical/policy approach to economics more closely suited my research interests.

I am motivated to get a PhD because I am driven both by the prospect of research and teaching. I envision a rewarding career as one in which I can learn about concepts that interest me, contribute to society's understanding of economic topics, and advance the field. I feel like I picked my research topic in sociology because it was something that was useful to society, not because it was something that really interested me a ton - and I now recognize the need to pursue a genuine interest in a PhD program.

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&amp;#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

A recent report from Jain Family Institute (JFI) reveals that access to college isnt just about the cost of college. Physical access to public higher education institutions across America has also been highly unequal. 

Specifically, as detailed by JFIs interactive map, regions in Americas West have little-to-no access to an institution of higher education, compared to the East Coast.


One of the major takeaways when you're looking at the map is the staggering amount of populated areas that are considered highly concentrated, Laura Beamer, higher education finance project lead at JFI and one of the two authors of the study, told Yahoo Finance. We figured out that roughly 2.4 million prospective students have access to most one public option nearby & Though financial access is extremely important, geographic access is also a very important piece of this dialogue and should be talked about more.


The Rocky Mountain region is the worst off, the report added, followed closely by the Plains region. 

The JFI report  which drew on various points of data from the 2016-17 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, enrollment data from 2017, the 2016 5-year population, and median income estimates from the American Community Survey, driving durations to higher ed institutions in the area, zip codes, and more  created a School Concentration Index which measures the variation across the higher education market across different types of schools in the U.S. and U.S. territories. 

Four states  Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming  were found to have higher education institution monopolies or close to it, meaning that there is only one institution or very few schools to choose from.



Prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions

The authors found that a highly concentrated zip code (in red) means that there are few  or in some cases zero  higher education institutions in the area. A low concentration implies that there are a wide variety of options available for prospective students.

In the U.S., 38% of the population lives in highly concentrated zip codes, where they have access to very few or no higher education institutions, according to Beamer and her co-author Marshall Steinbaum, who is also an assistant professor of economics at the University of Utah. If a student from these areas wanted to attend a college or university, their commute would be at least 45 minutes.

The unequal access has wide-ranging implications for prospective students, most of them negative.

Parts of the U.S. where theres little to no access to a higher ed institution are prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions, just as they are known to draw disproportionately from populations historically excluded from traditional higher ed on the basis of race and class, the authors argued.

The for-profit higher education sector saw tremendous growth since the financial crisis. In 2016, the New York Fed noted that enrollment at these schools had skyrocketed as the country emerged out of the Great Recession. For-profit colleges have also been known to saddle graduates with high levels of student debt, and in some cases, provide low-quality education with false promises of job placement.

The Obama administrations crackdown on for-profit colleges led to several closures, and recent action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pushed the University of Phoenix to put a stop to deceptive advertising of lucrative job opportunities.

Despite government action, for-profits persist due to these gaps in availability.



A school could ... possibly practice price discrimination

So why are schools so unequally distributed across the U.S. in the first place? 

It comes down to the structure that that states have put in place and just haven't been able to update over the last few decades, Beamer said. There is a rural versus urban dynamic as well & schools are going to open in places where there's a labor market and where there's a large population of students. 

The biggest problem arising is a neglect of the West, the researchers argue, where a school could determine prices and access unilaterally and possibly practice price discrimination.

More broadly, the issues raises a more philosophical question about what higher education represents.

We have this idea that higher education as a societal institution is egalitarian & there's also a lot of reasons why it isn't, said Steinbaum. This is one tiny piece of evidence among a broad painting of the fact that the higher education system is extremely stratified.

They're screwed on the front end as well as the other end

Another problem of education deserts trickles down below higher education.

Folks in these certain geographic areas which more often tend to be rural, have fewer options, Ryan Wells, associate professor of higher education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Yahoo Finance.

Rural students not only had fewer options for college, he explained, but they also had fewer resources to prepare them for college in the first place when compared to their suburban or urban counterparts.

It's kind of like   to put it crassly  they're screwed on the front end with what they have with their preparation and their resources and things to be ready for college, Wells said, and then fewer options on the other end as well.


Responsible colleges offer a way out

Fortunately, there are some good actors that restore faith in the system.

The University of Wyoming  despite having monopoly status  takes its job to offer accessible higher education seriously. 

We are quite a blue-collar state, University of Wyoming spokesperson Chad Baldwin told Yahoo Finance. Only about 24% of our adults have a bachelor's degree or higher [so] one of our goals is to try to lift the educational attainment level.

Baldwin noted that the university has a broad open admissions standard: Our acceptance rate is something in the order of 97%. Furthermore, according to Baldwin, more than half of the universitys graduates who started as first-time students didnt graduate with any student loan debt, thanks to low tuition and fees, and a state scholarship program.

The tuition for a Wyoming resident undergraduate for a year is about $6,300, he added.

Factoring in living costs and so on, that comes up to about $13,000 per year, based on data from the Department of Educations College Scorecard

In 2016, the New York Fed noted that enrollment at these schools had skyrocketed as the country emerged out of the Great Recession. For-profit colleges have also been known to saddle graduates with high levels of student debt, and in some cases, provide low-quality education with false promises of job placement.

The Obama administrations crackdown on for-profit colleges led to several closures, and recent action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pushed the University of Phoenix to put a stop to deceptive advertising of lucrative job opportunities.

Despite government action, for-profits persist due to these gaps in availability.



A school could ... possibly practice price discrimination

So why are schools so unequally distributed across the U.S. in the first place? 

It comes down to the structure that that states have put in place and just haven't been able to update over the last few decades, Beamer said. There is a rural versus urban dynamic as well & schools are going to open in places where there's a labor market and where there's a large population of students. 

The biggest problem arising is a neglect of the West, the researchers argue, where a school could determine prices and access unilaterally and possibly practice price discrimination.

More broadly, the issues raises a more philosophical question about what higher education represents.

We have this idea that higher education as a societal institution is egalitarian & there's also a lot of reasons why it isn't, said Steinbaum. This is one tiny piece of evidence among a broad painting of the fact that the higher education system is extremely stratified.

They're screwed on the front end as well as the other end

Another problem of education deserts trickles down below higher education.

Folks in these certain geographic areas which more often tend to be rural, have fewer options, Ryan Wells, associate professor of higher education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Yahoo Finance.

Rural students not only had fewer options for college, he explained, but they also had fewer resources to prepare them for college in the first place when compared to their suburban or urban counterparts.

It's kind of like   to put it crassly  they're screwed on the front end with what they have with their preparation and their resources and things to be ready for college, Wells said, and then fewer options on the other end as well.


Responsible colleges offer a way out

Fortunately, there are some good actors that restore faith in the system.

The University of Wyoming  despite having monopoly status  takes its job to offer accessible higher education seriously. 

We are quite a blue-collar state, University of Wyoming spokesperson Chad Baldwin told Yahoo Finance. Only about 24% of our adults have a bachelor's degree or higher [so] one of our goals is to try to lift the educational attainment level.

Baldwin noted that the university has a broad open admissions standard: Our acceptance rate is something in the order of 97%. Furthermore, according to Baldwin, more than half of the universitys graduates who started as first-time students didnt graduate with any student loan debt, thanks to low tuition and fees, and a state scholarship program.

The tuition for a Wyoming resident undergraduate for a year is about $6,300, he added.

Factoring in living costs and so on, that comes up to about $13,000 per year, based on data from the Department of Educations College Scorecard

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

{snip}

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}

"2020-08-12",1597269737,"We dont waste fellowships on women: Microbiologist Rita Colwell on sexism in academia","Congress had excluded white-collar professionals from the equal pay for equal work provisions of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Three years later, however, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11375 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against women when hiring. Researching the subject, Sandler spotted a footnote. Being an academic, she said, I read footnotes, so I turned to the back of the book to read it. And there, Sandler found a way forward for women like herself: by taking federal funds, the University of Maryland (and all research universities receiving federal funding) had become a federal contractor. It was a genuine Eureka moment, Sandler later wrote. I actually shrieked aloud. 

Working with the Womens Equity Action League, a small Ohio group focusing on economic and legal issues with educational institutions, Sandler filed a class action suit against the University of Maryland and 250 other American colleges and universities. She based many of the cases on evidence of bias in hiring, tenure decisions, promotions, and salaries sent to her by women from all over the country. Although Sandler would win some of these lawsuits, the lack of enforcement powers in Johnsons executive order muted her victories. There were no penalties for the offending universities to pay or procedures put in place to reverse the inequities. Thankfully, the story didnt end there.

Instead, the issue of employment bias moved quietly to Congress, where Representative Edith Green, an Oregon Democrat and former schoolteacher, was passionately interested in womens equality in education. Having accumulated enough seniority to chair a House subcommittee on education, she held hearings on sex discrimination in academia. Then Green made a savvy move: she moved the legislation that would come to be known as Title IX through Congress so stealthily that almost no onenot the men who voted for it nor the educational establishment that would be tasked with carrying it outknew what was happening.

Quietly organizing her forces, Green hired Sandler to coach her staff about gender discrimination in academia, while Vincent Macaluso, a sympathetic federal expert in the Department of Labor, provided secret advice on strategy. Morag Simchak, also from the Department of Labor, drafted an amendment so forbiddingly technical that she knew no one would even attempt to read it. Sandler reported tongue in cheek that Simchak, having informed her superiors once about her work on drafting the amendment, did not feel any great need to inform them again. Several months later, Green, without informing her colleagues in the House of Representatives about the implications of what she was doing, slipped Simchaks short passage banning sex discrimination in any educational program receiving federal aid into what would become the Educational Amendments Act of 1972. Once the passage was in the bill, Green ordered the leaders of womens groups not to lobby for Title IX of the act. She didnt want to alert the men in Congress to its importance. And so, still happily oblivious to what Title IX meant, Congress made it illegal to discriminate against women in education and gave individual women the power to sue universities in order to hold on to their jobs, protest tenure or employment decisions, and demand equal pay.

The university athletic establishment considered the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 a very minor bill, Sandler would later explain. The word sports was not even in it. A month later, Jonathan Spivak of the Wall Street Journal broke the real story under a masterfully understated headline: Sex-Bias Section Could Spark Controversy.

Worried about losing federal funds, university lawyers promptly ordered some quick fixes. Old-style anti-nepotism bans against hiring faculty wives gave way to modern prohibitions against relatives supervising relatives. Almost overnight, a few leading scientists were leapfrogged three steps up the academic ladder, from research associate to professor, including two women mentioned in the previous chapter Violet B. Haas, the brilliant mathematician in Purdues engineering department, and Dora Priaulx Henry, the barnacle expert at the University of Washington  and several accomplished research associates at Harvard. Thousands of women suddenly received big pay raises, often without explanation and generally without back pay. For the first time, educational institutions had to publicly advertise job searches, end gender quotas for admission to graduate and professional schools, and pay equal stipends for male and female graduate students  although white men continued to get prestigious research assistantships while women and other groups underrepresented in science continued to receive less-prestigious teaching assistantships.

Above all, Title IX allowed us to believe change was possible. But those of us who also hoped Title IX would take care of sexism in science were soon dismayed.

Me:  Can you explain to me how white people are marginalized? 

Angry Guy:  That report from the United Nations Population Division explained it. Here's a current example from south of the border.  [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/21/u-s-counties-majority-nonwhite/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgwSZf8b53hGUy4yMNR4AaABAg.9AaOcuBJaAn9AaSDOYnSnl&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXd0c0JlWkNvWmZCUkpHYm5QR3Zpc1o4X2p0d3xBQ3Jtc0ttYWdyUlRWM01YMVhkNEk3b1VSbzFQdmRSWk5TLVVHenktYmRWNGpUR3NPT1NUY2Y5ZmVtanFvelFvY3BBRzg5OE14ZndXWXNRdGRUdGJkWUxxTWcyeFZLdmcyUnNkV1lIRW1haVBHUkpfRzlBZTl4OA%3D%3D&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Ffact-tank%2F2019%2F08%2F21%2Fu-s-counties-majority-nonwhite%2F&amp;html_redirect=1&amp;event=comments) I suspect that's why people in the Identity Politics industry are starting to use a new term called ""racialized"" instead of ""minorities."". 

Me:  First of all, the article is about is the shifting demographics in the USA. The article suggests that white people are no longer the majority in various counties. However, if you pay close attention to the wording used, they were comparing white demographics to nonwhite demographics. This means that they lumped all minority populations (black, east asian, south asian, hispanic, middle eastern, etc.) within a county together and compared it to the population of one single race (white). The majority race in the counties mentioned may be (and probably are) still white, but when compared to the ENTIRE nonwhite population they are seen as the minority.  Second of all, marginalization is ""(of a person, group, or concept) treated as insignificant or peripheral."" This article only touches upon the changing demographics of the USA and does not explain how white people are being treated as insignificant in society. Minority is not synonymous with marginalized. Although minority groups are often marginalized, this does not automatically mean that every single minority group will face marginalization. Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority, can you give me an example of how white people are being marginalized? If you are a white person yourself, perhaps you could give me an example of how you have been marginalized in the past? 

Angry Guy:  "" Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority"" I didn't say anything. I merely quoted a U.N. demographic report.   "" give me an example of how white people are being marginalized?"" Again, that U.N. report is a forecast. A forecast that they have already had to projects upwards, There will be no population plateau or stabilization. It will continue to grow exponentially.  If 10% of the global population isn't a minority, I don't know whats is.  And that 10% includes non-Whites already living in the West, which is why I included that Pew research report.  Oh btw, I'm a Native living on a Indian reserve. Go ahead, ask me anything. I just tell it like it is.

Me:  Lol I'll ask again can you give me an example of how white people are treated as insignificant in society since you believe that they are marginalized? The article clearly has nothing to do with marginalization.  Also, in regards to when you said ""and then there will be no more racism or hate, amirite?"" If you had watched the whole video you would know that we talked about colourism and receiving hate within our race. We addressed the fact that there is work to be done within our own community as well and never claimed that all racism and hate comes from white people.

Me:  I don't think you understand that being the minority is not the same as being marginalized. No where in the UN report does it say that white people will be marginalized. Where is the assumption that white people will be marginalized coming from because you're evidence has nothing to do with marginalization. 

Angry Guy:  No, of course the U.N. would make no such admission, lol. It's simple math really. The White population, and by White I mean Europeans and their descendants, aka ""the West"",  has been in steady decline since the 1960's and the advent of Feminism and ""the Pill"". Countries where Feminism has no inroad have seen their populations explode. Sadly, in many nations females have no say over their bodies. It's their parents who decide who they marry and how many babies to have. Sad.   So, it's just a matter of time before Whites are about rare as unicorns.

Me:  Can you explain to me how white people are marginalized? 

Angry Guy:  That report from the United Nations Population Division explained it. Here's a current example from south of the border.  [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/21/u-s-counties-majority-nonwhite/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgwSZf8b53hGUy4yMNR4AaABAg.9AaOcuBJaAn9AaSDOYnSnl&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXd0c0JlWkNvWmZCUkpHYm5QR3Zpc1o4X2p0d3xBQ3Jtc0ttYWdyUlRWM01YMVhkNEk3b1VSbzFQdmRSWk5TLVVHenktYmRWNGpUR3NPT1NUY2Y5ZmVtanFvelFvY3BBRzg5OE14ZndXWXNRdGRUdGJkWUxxTWcyeFZLdmcyUnNkV1lIRW1haVBHUkpfRzlBZTl4OA%3D%3D&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Ffact-tank%2F2019%2F08%2F21%2Fu-s-counties-majority-nonwhite%2F&amp;html_redirect=1&amp;event=comments) I suspect that's why people in the Identity Politics industry are starting to use a new term called ""racialized"" instead of ""minorities."". 

Me:  First of all, the article is about is the shifting demographics in the USA. The article suggests that white people are no longer the majority in various counties. However, if you pay close attention to the wording used, they were comparing white demographics to nonwhite demographics. This means that they lumped all minority populations (black, east asian, south asian, hispanic, middle eastern, etc.) within a county together and compared it to the population of one single race (white). The majority race in the counties mentioned may be (and probably are) still white, but when compared to the ENTIRE nonwhite population they are seen as the minority.  Second of all, marginalization is ""(of a person, group, or concept) treated as insignificant or peripheral."" This article only touches upon the changing demographics of the USA and does not explain how white people are being treated as insignificant in society. Minority is not synonymous with marginalized. Although minority groups are often marginalized, this does not automatically mean that every single minority group will face marginalization. Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority, can you give me an example of how white people are being marginalized? If you are a white person yourself, perhaps you could give me an example of how you have been marginalized in the past? 

Angry Guy:  "" Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority"" I didn't say anything. I merely quoted a U.N. demographic report.   "" give me an example of how white people are being marginalized?"" Again, that U.N. report is a forecast. A forecast that they have already had to projects upwards, There will be no population plateau or stabilization. It will continue to grow exponentially.  If 10% of the global population isn't a minority, I don't know whats is.  And that 10% includes non-Whites already living in the West, which is why I included that Pew research report.  Oh btw, I'm a Native living on a Indian reserve. Go ahead, ask me anything. I just tell it like it is.

Me:  Lol I'll ask again can you give me an example of how white people are treated as insignificant in society since you believe that they are marginalized? The article clearly has nothing to do with marginalization.  Also, in regards to when you said ""and then there will be no more racism or hate, amirite?"" If you had watched the whole video you would know that we talked about colourism and receiving hate within our race. We addressed the fact that there is work to be done within our own community as well and never claimed that all racism and hate comes from white people.

That combined with the need to have diverse females and males screws over Asians. I was told by a former UPenn admissions officer that the worst demographic to be is Asian Male for all the reasons you can think of.

The NYT article Little Asia on the Hill explores the little known problem of Affirmative Action that affects Asian Americans. The article begins by describing how UC Berkley had a record high for Asians in their freshman class and what it was like for a student to be among such a large population of Asian students in the university.

&gt;    But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it  specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.

There have been long running suspicions among the Asian American community that they were often denied admission or wait-listed to make room for other students considered to be disadvantaged minorities. I find it interesting that although universities pride themselves on being tolerant and diverse, their admissions office uses a combination of stereotypes and impossible standards to create what they believe to be an incoming class with perfect diversity. It seems absurd that admissions officials would assess an Asian student at a much higher standard than his White counterparts because they are a supposedly superior Model Minority while judging African-Americans and Hispanics at a much lower standard using Whites as a neutral benchmark because they are implied to be inferior disadvantaged minorities. Additionally, it is even more racist to use Whites as a neutral standard in judging which groups are superior to receive harder burdens from the admissions officers, while using a lesser standard on the other groups, which appear to reaffirm the age-old American perception that Asians are superior while Blacks/Hispanics are not.

&gt;    Asians have become the new Jews, in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, The Price of Admission: How Americas Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges  and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.

&gt;    As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent)  despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.

&gt;    To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.

&gt;    This is just a very, very egregious system, Mr. Li told me. Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.

&gt;    To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.

&gt;    Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. Im not seeking anything personally, he says. Im happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.","asianamerican",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1juzmv/affirmative_action_harming_asians_most/","Affirmative Action  Harming Asians Most--I hate how Asians are stereotyped as being superior to Whites in college admissions, which forces them to limit their ranges of Asian students in incoming classes.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.",23

Edit:

Should I start a youtube channel?

I have some ideas to discuss like:

1.) Are open borders a good idea?

2.) What do the 2020 presidential candidates stand for?

3.) The ""Gender Wage Gap"" explained

4.) Is universal healthcare a good idea?

5.) Is Trump a Bigot?

6.) Should guns be banned?

7.) What should people do about global warming?

of course most of my points are going to be conservative but I won't say that. I'll just examine the issue and point out the facts. and the viewers will decide their side.

**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majoritys approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens  through the democratic process  to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution  even as confined to opposite-sex relations  has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on todays social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in todays majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity, I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obamas address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times  a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether theyre marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. Its a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. Its a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. Its a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. Its why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. Its why we ended, Dont Ask, Dont Tell.  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, weve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, Americas shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome todays news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. Thats always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.  
Thats the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.  
  
Thank you.

**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majoritys approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens  through the democratic process  to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution  even as confined to opposite-sex relations  has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on todays social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in todays majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity, I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obamas address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times  a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether theyre marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. Its a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. Its a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. Its a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. Its why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. Its why we ended, Dont Ask, Dont Tell.  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, weve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, Americas shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome todays news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. Thats always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.  
Thats the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.

And while many people abhor turning 30, I didnt. I was a failure the day before I turned 30  so naturally, being a failure a day later when I actually turned 30 didnt feel any differently.

I was going to ruin everyones Sunday when I trampled his or her team. And Id remind them of said trampling on Monday, and Tuesday, and most likely Wednesday.

But then something happened.  My brother called me to wish me a happy birthday. And with that, we got into our usual political discourse. And five minutes after beginning our conversation with a happy birthday, he accused me of idolizing the values of Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx.

Which made me think about the good old days. Before Sarah Palin. Before Eric Bolling. Before Michelle Malkin. And before the Tea Party& When I could have a civil discussion over politics with someone who doesnt share any of my political ideology. Today, they say I support Communism.

And while Id love to blame Sarah Palin, Eric Bolling or Sean Hannity  all who spew hatred and barefaced disrespect toward our President  they are just a few phony entertainers trying to make a Republican dollar out of our Democratic Euros. 

Its Republican strategist Steve Schmidt who created this hullabaloo. 

Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats in Congress were all just aspiring plutocrats interested in lining their own pockets. They were greedy. But we knew this. We werent stupid. But not today.

Today, the Tea Party is the Frankenstein Schmidt created. And he should feel guilty. He was so desperate to win the Presidency for McCain - he put someone who wasnt qualified, let alone bright, on the ticket for Vice President. In his next life, Steve Schmidt should be reincarnated as a Transvaginal Ultrasound wand in a liberal-friendly county Planned Parenthood. 

But I bet he didnt expect this decision would have such a bombastic effect on the country after their losing bid for the Presidency. Most likely, Schmidt thought Palin would go back to Wasilla and say funny things about Putin rearing his head into Alaska, or nuclear weapontry, or Africa being a state, or death panels, or refudiating the media  anything that is factually incorrect, or words not found in a dictionary.

But she didn't go away. She grew. She got bigger. She developed a following.

Her Tea Party has compared President Obama to Hitler. Palin herself has accused our President of palling around with terrorists. A socialist. A man of no valor. And that's only a few. The list goes on. Donald Trump and his birther fiasco. Although in fairness, Trump invented Trump Vodka, Celebrity Apprentice and eats pizza with a fork (which is a kind of a foreign thing to do, Donald Trump.) Arizona Governor Jan Brewer pointing her finger into the face of our President. Kansas House Speaker reciting a bible verse calling for President Obama to be killed. Newt Gingrich referring to our President as the most successful food stamp President of all time and his Kenyan anti-colonial behavior. Senator Mitch McConnell publicly announcing his number one priority was making sure the President wasnt re-elected. Congressman Joe Wilson screaming out you lie during the Presidents State of the Union address. Speaker John Boehner refusing the Presidents date to speak to a joint session on jobs. Allen West saying President Obama creates economic slaves. Michele Bachmann connecting the Swine Flu to Obama. And the list goes on and on and on.

And even worse  Mitt Romney, who is a moderate at heart, has turned on Yoda, cutting every sensible bone off his body with his red lightsaber and embraced the dark side  all to appease Darth Vader and his cronies - Fox News and their impressionable disciples.

Which brings me back to my point. To them, Im a Communist. Why?

Because I want women to be left alone. Because I want to drink clean water. Because I want the rich to pay a little more in taxes. Because I believe that everyone should be entitled to healthcare. Because I believe in gay marriage. Because I believe in climate change. Because I believe in amnesty for illegal immigrants who were taken to the United States through no fault of their own. Because I believe in free and fair elections. Because I believe in human rights. Because I dont care about religion  but believe everyones religious values should be respected. Because I believe in equal pay for women. Because I believe abortion should be left up to a woman. Because I believe in stricter gun laws. Because I believe in affirmative action. And because I dont believe every conflict needs to be settled by war.

&So that makes me a Marxist?

But then there's the irony when a Republican compares me to a murderer like Joseph Stalin& When Im the one who doesnt want to fight a war and Dick Cheney, Halliburton and countless Republican Senators and Representatives make money off war.  

Which brings me back to my point - fantasy football. I will not play fantasy football this year, but rather  I will donate the $150 to the Presidents re-election campaign. And while I know $150 wont change anything  especially with Citizens United, Im hoping more people like me wont splurge on something this year and spend it on someone who will make your future brighter. Someone who will continue to clean up this mess caused by the Republicans. Someone who will fight for the middle class. Someone who doesnt care who you marry. Someone who doesn't want to utter the words - Transvaginal Ultrasound.  And someone who wants everyone to have affordable healthcare.   

That isnt Mitt Romney. He has now donned the Darth Vader armor  paid for by the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson and the like. And if Mitt Romney cant stand up to leaders of his own party now  imagine what kind of puppet hed become if elected President of the United States.

And Remember, President Obama set forth the greenlight for the Osama Bin Laden mission while embarrassing Donald Trump during the White House Correspondents Dinner  killing Trumps dignity and credibility, and icing Bin Laden, too.

Mitt Romney would need to see internal polling before making such a decision. Or change his mind half way through the mission. Or just promise to repeal ObamaCare. 

Its not Communism. Its not about fantasy football. Its just common sense.

BUCHANAN TO OBAMA

Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:

First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.

Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.

We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???

Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown , and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids.? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?

Well, you can make your own judgments...

--------------------------------------------------

Finally someone has the guts to say what so many of the rest of us have been thinking....

 
BUCHANAN TO OBAMA

Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:

First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.

Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.

We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???

Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown , and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids.? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?

Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself?

As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?

Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?

""The \[order\] is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion.""

In the 5-4 opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that Trump's immigration restriction fell ""squarely"" within the president's authority. The court rejected claims that the ban was motivated by religious hostility.

""The \[order\] is expressly premised on legitimate purposes: preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,"" Roberts wrote. ""The text says nothing about religion.""

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more uniform and effective the prior patchwork of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the [i]nitial registration requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement. §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the [i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b). The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNAs enactment (pre-Act offenders), the Attorney General
shall have the authority to specify the applicability of SORNAs
registration requirements and to prescribe rules for [their] registration. §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNAs registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District
Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to specify the applicability of SORNAs registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more uniform and effective the prior patchwork of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the [i]nitial registration requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement. §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the [i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b). The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNAs enactment (pre-Act offenders), the Attorney General
shall have the authority to specify the applicability of SORNAs
registration requirements and to prescribe rules for [their] registration. §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNAs registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District

###UPDATES:

**US v. Haymond**

The 10th Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

[Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1672_5hek.pdf)

The court holds that a federal law requiring a defendant who is registered as a sex offender to return to prison for at least five years if a federal judge finds that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release is unconstitutional.

Update: Finishing up edits on a story  will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the Universitys investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's],"" wrote Justice Souter, ""[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. 

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent.

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the fathers name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the fathers registration. The mother listed Baby Girls ethnicity as Hispanic instead of Native American on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an Indian Child under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couples petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a parent under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the fathers consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define parent to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. 

* CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. 

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,""Indian, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6.""

**UTSW v. Nassar** 

* *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassars productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassars presence, Middle Easterners are lazy. In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keisers presence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassars productivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar applied for a promotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levines harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a position at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding positions to be filled by faculty doctors. In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back pay and compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to support the claim of constructive discharge.

* *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive, or does the provision require only proof that the employer had mixed motives for taking an action?

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the Universitys investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's],"" wrote Justice Souter, ""[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. 

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent.

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the fathers name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the fathers registration. The mother listed Baby Girls ethnicity as Hispanic instead of Native American on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an Indian Child under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couples petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a parent under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the fathers consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define parent to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. 

* CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. 

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,""Indian, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6.""

"2013-06-17",1371484426,"SCOTUS: Five opinions released today on 6/17/2013","(1). http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf

Details: **Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.**

As part of an effort to increase voter registration and turnout, in 1993 Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act.  The Act requires states to accept and use a specific federal form for voter registration; that form asks, among other things, whether the would-be voter is a citizen of the United States and over the age of eighteen.  In 2004, Arizona voters approved a law that requires election officials in that state to refuse to register any would-be voter who cannot prove that he is in fact a citizen.  Arizona residents, along with voting and civil rights groups, challenged the state law, arguing that it could not stand because it conflicted with, and was trumped by, the NVRA.  The challengers won in the lower court, and the Supreme Court granted review last fall to consider not only whether the state law can survive, but also whether the lower court used the right test in making its decision:  that court held that because the Constitution allows Congress to make or change election rules established by the states, Congress can veto any state laws relating to elections, even if it doesnt make clear that it intends to do so.

Today the Court held, in a seven-to-two decision by Justice Scalia, that Arizonas law cannot stand in the face of the NVRA. The Court first recognized that under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to dictate when, where, and how elections are held, and state election laws that conflict with federal ones are therefore preempted and without effect. The Court thus held that by requiring states to accept and use the federal form, the NVRA effectively required the states to treat the federal form as sufficient evidence of citizenship without any additional proof, so that Arizonas proof-of-citizenship requirement was contrary to the NVRA, and therefore invalid.  The Court recognized that the words accept and use do not necessarily carry such a broad meaning  they could mean only that the state was required to consider the federal form  but based on the context and the other provisions in the NVRA, the Court concluded that the requirement to accept and use the federal form has the stronger effect of requiring states to treat the federal form as sufficient. On the question of which legal test to apply, the Court made it clear that while preemption under the Supremacy Clause (which provides that federal law generally trumps contrary state law) requires Congress to clearly state its intent to preempt state requirements, preemption under the Elections Clause is more easily found because federal elections law will alwaysdisplace state law.

Finally, the Court held that in the future, Arizona can ask the federal Election Assistance Commission, which creates the federal form, to include a requirement of additional proof of citizenship in the form, and to bring different legal challenges if the EAC refuses to do so.

Justice Kennedy drafted a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment; Justices Thomas and Alito each filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that Arizonas requirement should not have been held preempted.

**Salinas v. Texas.**  

Texas CCA affirmed.  Issue: Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendments Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendants refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.  Alito opinion says the defendant did not expressly invoke his 5th Amendment rights so the prosecutor can comment on this silence to police questioning.

Details: **FTC v. Actavis**
This case is an antitrust challenge to an increasingly common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name companies faced with generic competition pay the would-be competitor an amount of money to stay out of the market.  The payment comes in the form of settling a dispute over the validity or infringement of the brand-name companys patent.  Because generic entry reduces drug prices, these pay for delay or reverse payment agreements are alleged to reduce competition and increase drug costs.  The Federal Trade Commission sued drug companies over one such deal.  The court of appeals rejected that claim, explaining that the brand names patent includes the right to exclude competitors.

Today, by a vote of five to three, the Supreme Court reversed and held that the claim can go forward.  Justice Breyer wrote the Courts opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas.  Justice Alito was recused from the case.

The Court held that the government and private parties may seek to prove that these payments violate the antitrust laws.  It refused, however, to hold them presumptively illegal.  The ruling is likely to essentially put an end to such payments in the future.  Litigation over previous deals will continue in the lower courts.

Details: **Maracich v. Spears**
A federal law, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), prohibits the use of a drivers information from a state DMV without prior permission from the driver.  In this case, lawyers sued South Carolina car dealers on behalf of four individuals who had recently bought cars, alleging that the car dealers had violated a state consumer protection law.  Using contact information from the South Carolina DMV, they then tried to find additional plaintiffs for their lawsuits so that they could form a class action lawsuit.  However, lawyers for the car dealers then filed a lawsuit on behalf of other South Carolinians who had recently bought cars, alleging that the use of the information from the DMV violated the DPPA.  At issue before the Court was whether the original lawsuit against the car dealers was allowed under a provision of the DPPA that creates a litigation exception to the laws general ban on use of driver data; that exception allows the use of driver data in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any Federal, State, or local court . . . including . . . investigation in anticipation of litigation.

Writing for a five-Justice majority, Justice Kennedys opinion for the Court held that the litigation exception does not apply to attorney solicitations of potential clients using DMV data.   Because the statute generally protects highly sensitive information, any exception should be read narrowly, the Court held.  The reference to an investigation in anticipation extends only to activities to decide whether a potential claim has sufficient merit to warrant a lawsuit, or to locate witnesses, but not activities designed to sign up clients for a case.

The Court remanded the case for the lower courts to decide whether, viewed objectively, the predominant purpose of the use of the DMV information was for client solicitation (in which case it was illegal) or for some other permissible litigation-related purposes (in which case it was legal).

Joining Justice Kennedys opinion were the Chief Justice, along with Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito.  Justices Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

**ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES.**  

Issue: Whether this Courts decision in Harris v. United States, holding that the Constitution does not require facts which increase a mandatory minimum sentence to be determined by a jury, should be overruled.  

Held: Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element that must be submitted to the jury.  Thomas went with majority.  He is into juries deciding things at least.

**1) Descamps v. US (Kagan writes, 8-1)**

Issue: Whether, in a case under the Armed Career Criminal Act, when a state crime does not require an element of the federal crime of burglary, the federal court may find the existence of that element by examining the record of the state proceedings under the ""modified categorical approach.""

Decision summary: *The modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes that contain a single indivisible set of elements. ""In Plain English, it is now harder for the government to use the facts of a prior conviction to enhance a federal criminal sentence.""*

9th Circuit reversed.

Justice Alito dissents.

**2) AmEx v. Italian Colors (Scalia writes, 5-3)**

Issue: Whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts, invoking the federal substantive law of arbitrability, to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a federal-law claim. 

Decision summary: *The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiffs cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. ""In Plain English, this means that if you have a contract with a business in which you agree to arbitrate a dispute but it says you can't get together with other plaintiffs in a ""class action,"" that contract will be enforced, even if it may be too expensive for you to pursue your own claim given what you might win.""*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-133_19m1.pdf)

2nd Circuit reversed. 

Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan dissent. 

Sotomayor recused. 

------

**3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes, 6-2)**

Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C. § 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.

Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program. The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.*

**Informed Speculation**:

- We can now confidently speculate that Shelby County v. Holder will be written by Roberts. This is due to Scalia writing the AmEx decision today. This favors the plaintiffs in Shelby County. 

- We can now confidently speculate that Koontz v. St. Johns River will be written by Alito. This is due to Kagan writing the Descamps decision today. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Alito will write the opinion in Vance v. Ball State. This favors the respondent Ball State. 

- We can confidently speculate that Kennedy will write the opinion in Fisher v. UT-Austin. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Roberts and Kennedy will be writing Perry/Windsor. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

*Speculation is based upon the monthly distribution of opinions.*

Please do correct me if I'm wrong.  But effectively this is what I've gathered from it...

&gt;In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13-356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company-Conestoga Wood Specialties-a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third [*2] Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not ""engage in religious exercise"" under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity. In No. 13-354, the Greens, their children, and their companies-Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel-were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that the Greens' businesses are ""persons"" under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the ""least restrictive means"" of furthering a compelling governmental interest.

This to me says... the Third Circuit ruled that they can not practice religion and therefore can not claim the exemption from the RFRA.  Then the Tenth Circuit ""reversed"" (which I understand to mean undid that ruling?  effectively making it so they *can* get out of paying for birth control).  Then we read the conclusion...

&gt;For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

What does this mean?  I read it as ""let's undo the Tenth's undoing and make it illegal for them to be exempt from it"".  I feel like I'm very obviously misunderstanding this.  Can anyone shed some light on this topic?

"2012-04-19",1334812761,"Does Equal Protection (Con. Law) apply to a union of classes or only an intersection?","   Im writing to get a discussion going about the best way to apply equal protection analysis to a law that classifies based on two classes.
     Here is a hypo to explain: A law precludes 21 to 24 year old males from being served more than two beers at a bar. Under equal protection analysis, there are two classes Age and Sex.

I. Under the analysis I was taught, we go through each class separately. The age class supports a rational basis analysis. The government says that the goal is to reduce drunk driving or more generally promote traffic safety. At least 25% of drunk driving accidents occur from people between the ages of 21-24, but only 3% of this age group gets into accidents. The goal rationally related to the means, so the law is fine as far as age goes. The sex classification is intermediate scrutiny. The goal is the same, and traffic safety is an important purpose. Under a means analysis, the law is overinclusive because not all men drive after they have had two beers; perhaps only 20% do. Additionally the law is over inclusive because some women drink and drive (5%). Thus, the means isnt substantially connected to the goal, and the law gets booted as being unconstitutional for violating equal protection. Disclaimer  statistics are mostly made up.

II. Under at least one case (Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976)), the Court looks at the statistics for the intersection of the classes and applies the highest level of scrutiny accorded the intersection. So&
 Under intermediate scrutiny the goal is the same (traffic safety), and it is important. The means is based on the statistic that compelled the law: about 92% of drunk driving accidents between people of ages 21-24 are caused by males, but only 2% of males between the ages of 21-24 get in such accidents. Only .18% of females of that age group get into such accidents. The goal is thus not substantially connected to the means, and the law gets chucked.

  Although, in this case both analyses get the law thrown out, I think the analyses (I. and II.) would play out differently under different suspect classes. For two non-suspect classes it would give you different answers. For instance,  a law that prevents age 21-24, gay people from serving alcohol because they are more likely to serve minors (with similar statistics as above). Under the first analysis (separating the classes) the law would hold up, but probably not under the second analysis (looking at the combined). 

 Juxtapose to another hypo -- affirmative action for two suspect classes: black, female engineers get a stipend for higher education to promote diversity in school. Grutter (539 U.S. 306) provides some precedent. In that case, a similar practice was upheld because race was not the only factor in admitting students to law school. The factors could be weighted to conform to Grutter: only females with a certain GPA are eligible for the scholarship, and if there is a tie the state school can consider ethnicity as tie breaker.  Under Analysis I the state practice would probably be ok (female engineers are an important goal to promote a balanced workforce, and race is ok to consider as one factor in the compelling interest of diversity under Grutter), but under analysis II the practice would probably be considered unconstitutional (race, sex, and GPA cannot be the sole criteria for the scholarship similar to Gratz, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).

&gt; Of the 27 U.S. urban school districts that reported their results for 2019from Boston and Chicago to Fort Worth, Texas, and Los Angelesnot a single one can say a majority of the black eighth graders in their care are proficient in either math or reading.

In a number of these school districts, proficiency rates for black eighth graders are down in the single digits (see Detroits 4% for math and 5% for reading, or Milwaukees 5% for math and 7% for reading). Most are in the low teens.
***
...the countrys best results are still pretty rotten. Charlotte, N.C., is way ahead of the rest of the pack with 24% of its black eighth graders proficient in math. For reading, Boston took the top slot at 20%
***
Of the 100 largest public school systems (based on enrollment), the six that spent the most per pupil in FY 2019 were the New York City School District in New York ($28,004), Boston City Schools in Massachusetts ($25,653), Washington Schools in the District of Columbia ($22,406), San Francisco Unified in California ($17,228), Atlanta School District in Georgia ($17,112), and Seattle Public Schools in Washington ($16,543)

&gt; San Francisco and Seattle arent part of the Trial Urban District Assessment districts reporting their scores. But the other four are, and their scores for black achievement are as bad as the rest.

Urban public school districts have given up on their core mission: to provide children, i.e., to teach and inculcate them, with the knowledge and skills required to become successful and productive adults. Is there another explanation for this failure other than systemic racism?

Rarely will you see celebrities take any action that might displease their corporate masters. Most celebs aren't as [blatant about it as Laila Ali](https://atlantadailyworld.com/2016/09/30/laila-ali-refuses-to-support-black-lives-matter/), but seeing famous entertainers as agents of change is about as realistic as the idea that [systemic police reform was ever a serious possibility](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html) in 2020 America.

Celebrities always remain a safe distance behind any movement toward social justice, because they literally cannot afford to risk multimillion-dollar brand empires by alienating the mainstream (white) audience.

All you'll ever find from celebrity ""culture"" is the most profitable version of white society that they want to believe (and literally buy into) about themselves.

**Example**: is the average white person racist? No -- they support BLM alongside their favourite stars on social media for a few days after yet another person is murdered by police. They hover like unwelcome ghosts over subreddits for non-white people and can't resist offering their approving opinions or silent downvotes.

Cultural minorities (Native, black, brown, Asian, LGBT, etc.) will never control mainstream narratives beyond what the cultural majority already wants to see.

**Example**: white women are not members of a cultural minority in modern society. Why, then, are cisgender/heterosexual white women (usually middle-class or above) prioritised as unofficial spokespeople for cultural ""liberation""?

In reality, [fewer than half (45%) of white adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/16/support-for-black-lives-matter-has-decreased-since-june-but-remains-strong-among-black-americans/) now express at least some support of the Black Lives Matter movement, [down from 60% in June](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/). They are falling back asleep.

---

In the meantime, we are told to embrace: ""black whore who loves violent sex"" roleplay rebranded as ""black feminist empowerment""; black male abuse and violence as ""masculinity"" to be excused; happily inoffensive modern Aunt Jemima caricatures as a vision for progress; calculatingly presented ""strong black women"" and borderline ""magical Negro"" stereotypes through Disneyfied appropriation of African imagery, released right on time to capitalise on the middle-class white mood.

**Example**: imagine Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande in the place of Megan and Cardi in the video for ""WAP"". No? You can't? Yes, that's right. It would never happen. Why is that? We already know why (hint: the good white women aren't whores). But Gaga can appropriate LGBT culture as she sees fit since drag queens are cool, and a sprinkling of cringe-inducing ""sassy black woman"" mannerisms are always on-trend for white gay culture. Grande can use blatant brownface whenever she wants, because it's fashionable to be ambiguously brown nowadays (for reference, Ariana Grande is a bright-white person [beneath all that spray-tan](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28337288/fans-accuse-vogue-ariana-grande-darken-skin-color-black-august-cover-instagram/) and cover-up).

Questions:

- What if Megan thee Stallion and Cardi B. role-playing whores in a music video is really just two black women role-playing whores in a music video? What if the ""controversy"" is really just new marketing spin defending ugly old imagery (the _""**Jezebel**""_ type)? What if ""you can't do it to me because I'm doing it to myself"" is really just the same abuse given an internalised excuse?

- What if Lizzo suddenly proclaiming that body-positivity is too ""commercialised"" is just a self-preserving reaction to stem backlash against her for using the ""smiling, inoffensive, overweight black woman"" trope (the _""**Mammy**""_ type) as her primary means to become rich and famous? (Just wait for the ""authentic"" Lizzo makeup kit and clothing line.)

- What if celebrities aren't really our rich-and-famous friends, but rather, corporate brands designed for and largely catering to mainstream white audiences, constructed entirely to profit from the entertaining ""drama"" of our pain and emotional manipulation? What if most black and brown celebrities are just demographically-shifted versions of the toxic white ones?

- What if all the talk about ""self-care as revolution"" actually makes it practically impossible to actually stand up, move and take action to create change -- because the meaning of ""revolution"" has suddenly been reframed as the revolutionary act of repeating self-affirmations in the mirror and taking rebellious selfies?

- What if posting woke memes on Instagram and arguing on social media is actually just complicit participation in mass distraction, while the white male operators of these platforms earn billions from weaponised misinformation and turn a blind eye to violent hate speech?

---

Have you ever wondered why you perpetually feel tired, depressed and angry, rather than uplifted, energised and motivated?

What if everything we're told by the mass media about self-care, celebrity role models and social change is wrong?

Why are we defending corporate brands and lying to ourselves?

What happens after we wake up?

What comes next?

- What if self-care were placed in the context of social action, rather than the other way around?

Rarely will you see celebrities take any action that might displease their corporate masters. Most celebs aren't as [blatant about it as Laila Ali](https://atlantadailyworld.com/2016/09/30/laila-ali-refuses-to-support-black-lives-matter/), but seeing famous entertainers as agents of change is about as realistic as the idea that [systemic police reform was ever a serious possibility](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html) in 2020 America.

Celebrities always remain a safe distance behind any movement toward social justice, because they literally cannot afford to risk multimillion-dollar brand empires by alienating the mainstream (white) audience.

All you'll ever find from celebrity ""culture"" is the most profitable version of white society that they want to believe (and literally buy into) about themselves.

**Example**: is the average white person racist? No -- they support BLM alongside their favourite stars on social media for a few days after yet another person is murdered by police. They hover like unwelcome ghosts over subreddits for non-white people and can't resist offering their approving opinions or silent downvotes.

Cultural minorities (Native, black, brown, Asian, LGBT, etc.) will never control mainstream narratives beyond what the cultural majority already wants to see.

**Example**: white women are not members of a cultural minority in modern society. Why, then, are cisgender/heterosexual white women (usually middle-class or above) prioritised as unofficial spokespeople for cultural ""liberation""?

In reality, [fewer than half (45%) of white adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/16/support-for-black-lives-matter-has-decreased-since-june-but-remains-strong-among-black-americans/) now express at least some support of the Black Lives Matter movement, [down from 60% in June](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/). They are falling back asleep.

In the meantime, we are told to embrace: ""black whore who loves violent sex"" roleplay rebranded as ""black feminist empowerment""; black male abuse and violence as ""masculinity"" to be excused; happily inoffensive modern Aunt Jemima caricatures as a vision for progress; calculatingly presented ""strong black women"" and borderline ""magical Negro"" stereotypes through Disneyfied appropriation of African imagery, released right on time to capitalise on the middle-class white mood.

**Example**: imagine Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande in the place of Megan and Cardi in the video for ""WAP"". No? You can't? Yes, that's right. It would never happen. Why is that? We already know why (hint: the good white women aren't whores). But Gaga can appropriate LGBT culture as she sees fit since drag queens are cool, and a sprinkling of cringe-inducing ""sassy black woman"" mannerisms are always on-trend for white gay culture. Grande can use blatant brownface whenever she wants, because it's fashionable to be ambiguously brown nowadays (for reference, Ariana Grande is a bright-white person [beneath all that spray-tan](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28337288/fans-accuse-vogue-ariana-grande-darken-skin-color-black-august-cover-instagram/) and cover-up).

Questions:

- What if Megan thee Stallion and Cardi B. role-playing whores in a music video is really just two black women role-playing whores in a music video? What if the ""controversy"" is really just new marketing spin defending ugly old imagery (the _""**Jezebel**""_ type)? What if ""you can't do it to me because I'm doing it to myself"" is really just the same abuse given an internalised excuse?

- What if Lizzo suddenly proclaiming that body-positivity is too ""commercialised"" is just a self-preserving reaction to stem backlash against her for using the ""smiling, inoffensive, overweight black woman"" trope (the _""**Mammy**""_ type) as her primary means to become rich and famous? (Just wait for the ""authentic"" Lizzo makeup kit and clothing line.)

- What if celebrities aren't really our rich-and-famous friends, but rather, corporate brands designed for and largely catering to mainstream white audiences, constructed entirely to profit from the entertaining ""drama"" of our pain and emotional manipulation? What if most black and brown celebrities are just demographically-shifted versions of the toxic white ones?

- What if all the talk about ""self-care as revolution"" actually makes it practically impossible to actually stand up, move and take action to create change -- because the meaning of ""revolution"" has suddenly been reframed as the revolutionary act of repeating self-affirmations in the mirror and taking rebellious selfies?

- What if posting woke memes on Instagram and arguing on social media is actually just complicit participation in mass distraction, while the white male operators of these platforms earn billions from weaponised misinformation and turn a blind eye to violent hate speech?

---

Have you ever wondered why you perpetually feel tired, depressed and angry, rather than uplifted, energised and motivated?

What if everything we're told by the mass media about self-care, celebrity role models and social change is wrong?

Why are we defending corporate brands and lying to ourselves?

What happens after we wake up?

What comes next?

When she finished her book, she titled it Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Wilkersons thesis is that Americans current obsession with race is somewhat misplaced, for there is a deeper and more intractable system that hides behind the chimera of race, and that system is properly called American caste.

I wrote that post in response to an ugly strain of otherwise hard-to-understand racism, specifically directed at ""the blacks"", among Desi (Indian and other South Asian) people on Reddit.

That repetition of anti-black, anti-Native, anti-Latino stereotypes collectively represent a failure to recognise and resist the model-minority stereotype.

According to the above article, Asian Americans are the least likely group in the US to be promoted to management. I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all.

AAPI was an expansion of the term in the 1980s for the purposes of the US census. At the same time, these terms have been a contributor to the marginalization of people who aren't visible within this umbrella. With 50 years of Asian American behind us, and as a reader of r/asianamerican, do you feel like these terms have helped or harmed more?

There's significant discourse today around the disaggregation of ""Asian Americans"" within the US - especially around data. I'm pretty sold on the value of data disaggregation, but I don't have a well formed opinion about the pros and cons of umbrella terms like ""Asian American"" or ""AAPI"" when used in reference to sociopolitical issues (duly noted that data disaggregation is pretty firmly tied to these though).

[https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/](https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/)[https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/](https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/#:~:text=Data%20disaggregation%20in%20the%20AAPI,that%20certain%20AAPI%20subgroups%20face)

On one hand, I think it's incredibly valuable to be able to unite around a convenient, shared identity (say around #stopasianhate), but when talking about issues like affirmative action, economic mobility, and generally who benefits from ""Asian American exceptionalism"", I find that when I and others use those umbrella terms, it's incredibly easy to fall into harmful generalizations (i.e. the model minority myth). I often wish that I didn't have this term Asian American to lean on, or otherwise add a million caveats, in order to describe a particular phenomenon. When I read Asian American/AAPI in news, or even just within this subreddit without those specifying qualifications, I'm immediately turned off. I find that a lot of writing can be incredibly alienating to individuals who don't fall under the predominantly visible East Asian Taft-Hartley knowledge worker type immigrant families.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999874296/6-charts-that-dismantle-the-trope-of-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999874296/6-charts-that-dismantle-the-trope-of-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority)

[https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/](https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/)

On the other hand, it's already hard enough to feel a shared identity when so many people don't share the same culture + history to unite. Would losing out on these umbrella terms make things even worse? I imagine if every AAPI organization/fellowship/etc turned into 20 different organizations/fellowships/etc, that would have its own problems.

Honestly it feels like there's no easy way to win.

My conclusion is that it never will be easy. Terms like Asian American and AAPI come with a heavy responsibility. The reason that these terms have failed us, is that those who have reaped the benefits have not invested more into uplifting those who remain the most marginalized, and are different from popular perception. Acknowledging the diversity is not enough - we need to actively include all people that these terms intentionally or unintentionally have labeled.

What do you think? Have we gained more from having these umbrella terms or do we only end up alienating more people not captured by popular perception behind?

AAPI was an expansion of the term in the 1980s for the purposes of the US census. At the same time, these terms have been a contributor to the marginalization of people who aren't visible within this umbrella. With 50 years of Asian American behind us, and as a reader of r/asianamerican, do you feel like these terms have helped or harmed more?

There's significant discourse today around the disaggregation of ""Asian Americans"" within the US - especially around data. I'm pretty sold on the value of data disaggregation, but I don't have a well formed opinion about the pros and cons of umbrella terms like ""Asian American"" or ""AAPI"" when used in reference to sociopolitical issues (duly noted that data disaggregation is pretty firmly tied to these though).

[https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/](https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/)[https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/](https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/#:~:text=Data%20disaggregation%20in%20the%20AAPI,that%20certain%20AAPI%20subgroups%20face)

On one hand, I think it's incredibly valuable to be able to unite around a convenient, shared identity (say around #stopasianhate), but when talking about issues like affirmative action, economic mobility, and generally who benefits from ""Asian American exceptionalism"", I find that when I and others use those umbrella terms, it's incredibly easy to fall into harmful generalizations (i.e. the model minority myth). I often wish that I didn't have this term Asian American to lean on, or otherwise add a million caveats, in order to describe a particular phenomenon. When I read Asian American/AAPI in news, or even just within this subreddit without those specifying qualifications, I'm immediately turned off. I find that a lot of writing can be incredibly alienating to individuals who don't fall under the predominantly visible East Asian Taft-Hartley knowledge worker type immigrant families.

[https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/](https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/)

On the other hand, it's already hard enough to feel a shared identity when so many people don't share the same culture + history to unite. Would losing out on these umbrella terms make things even worse? I imagine if every AAPI organization/fellowship/etc turned into 20 different organizations/fellowships/etc, that would have its own problems.

Honestly it feels like there's no easy way to win.

My conclusion is that it never will be easy. Terms like Asian American and AAPI come with a heavy responsibility. The reason that these terms have failed us, is that those who have reaped the benefits have not invested more into uplifting those who remain the most marginalized, and are different from popular perception. Acknowledging the diversity is not enough - we need to actively include all people that these terms intentionally or unintentionally have labeled.

What do you think? Have we gained more from having these umbrella terms or do we only end up alienating more people not captured by popular perception behind?

"2016-11-14",1479101236,"We Will Not Be Used: Are Asian-Americans the Racial Bourgeoisie?","By Mari J. Matsuda

American lawyer, activist, and law professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii. Prior to her return to Hawaii, Matsuda was a professor at the UCLA School of Law and Georgetown University Law Center, specializing in the fields of torts, constitutional law, legal history, feminist theory, critical race theory, and civil rights law.

Based on an April 1990 address to the Asian Law Caucus, first published February 1993
 
An essay I came across from Matsudas Where Is Your Body? And Other Essays on Race, Gender, and the Law.


*The Asian Law Caucus is the original public interest law firm serving the Asian-American community. It was built up from scratch by young, radical lawyers who carried files in their car trunks and stayed up all night to type their own briefs. The Asian Law Caucus has changed the lives of many-poor and working people, immigrants, and troubled youth - the least advantaged in the Asian-American community. The Caucus has also made history, successfully bringing landmark cases that have changed the law and the legal system. The supporters of the Caucus include many who participated in the civil rights and antiwar movements and who have worked all their lives in coalition with other people of color. This history is what inspired the words below, delivered at a fund-raising banquet in April 1990.*

It is a special honor to address supporters of the Asian Law Caucus. Here, before this audience, I am willing to speak in the tradition of our women warriors, to go beyond the platitudes of fundraiser formalism, and to talk of something that's been bothering me and that I need your help on. I want to speak of my fear that Asian-Americans are in danger of becoming the racial bourgeoisie, and of my resolve to resist that path. 

Marx wrote of the economic bourgeoisie -- the small merchants, the middle class, the baby capitalists--who were deeply confused about their self-interest. The bourgeoisie, he said, often emulate the manners and the ideology of the big-time capitalists. They are the wannabes of capitalism. Struggling for riches, often failing, confused about the reasons why, the economic wannabes go to their graves thinking that the big hit is right around the corner.

Living in 19th century Europe, Marx thought mostly in terms of class. Living in 20th century America, in the land where racism found a home, I am thinking about race. Is there a racial equivalent of the economic bourgeoisie? I fear there may be, and I fear it may be us.

If white, historically, is the top of the racial hierarchy in America, and black, historically, is the bottom, will yellow assume the place of the racial middle? The role of the racial middle is a critical one. It can reinforce white supremacy if the middle deludes itself into thinking it can be just like white if it tries hard enough. Conversely, the middle can dismantle white supremacy if it refuses to be the middle, if it refuses to buy into racial hierarchy, if it refuses to abandon communities of Black and Brown people, choosing instead to form alliances with them.

The theme of the unconventional fundraiser talk you are listening to is, ""we will not be used."" It is a plea to Asian-Americans to think about the ways in which our communities are particularly susceptible to playing the worst version of the racial bourgeoisie role.

In thinking this, I remember my mother's stories of growing up on a sugar plantation on Kauai. She tells of the Portuguese luna or overseer. The luna rode on a big horse and ordered the Japanese and Filipino workers around. The luna in my mother's stories is a tragic-comic figure. He thinks he is better than the other workers, but he doesn't realize that the plantation owner considers the luna sub-human, just like the other workers. The stereotype of the dumb portagee persists in Hawaii today, a holdover from the days of the luna parading around the big house, cloaked in self-delusion and false pride.

The double tragedy for the plantation nisei who hated the luna is that the sansei in Hawaii are becoming the new luna. Nice Japanese girls from Manoa Valley are going through four years of college to get degrees in Travel Industry Management, in order to sit behind a small desk in a big hotel, to dole out marching orders to brown-skinned workers and to take orders from a white man with a bigger desk and a bigger paycheck who never has to complicate his life by dealing with the brown people who make the beds and serve the food.  He need only deal with the Nice Japanese Girl, ex-Cherry Blossom Queen, eager to please, who doesn't know she will never make it to the bigger desk.

The portagee luna now has the last laugh with this new unfunny portagee joke: when the portagee was the luna, he didn't have to pay college tuition to ride that horse.

I'd like to say to my sister behind the small desk, ""remember where you came from and take this pledge: we will not be used.""

There are one hundred ways to use the racial bourgeoisie. Here are some examples:

When Asian-Americans manage to do well, their success is used against others. Internally, it is used to erase the continuing poverty and social dislocation within Asian-American communities. The media is full of stories of Asian-American whiz kids. Their successes are used to erase our problems and to disavow any responsibility for them. The dominant culture doesn't know about drug abuse in our communities, about our high school dropouts, our AIDS victims.

Suggestions that some segments of the Asian-American community need special help are greeted with suspicion and disbelief. External to our communities, our successes are used to deny racism and to put down other groups. African-Americans and Latinos and poor whites are told, ""look at those Asians--anyone can make it in this country if they really try."" The cruelty of telling this to crack babies, to workers displaced by runaway shops, and to families waiting in line at homeless shelters, is not something I want associated with my genealogy. 

Yes, my ancestors made it in this country, but they made it against the odds. In my genealogy and probably in yours, are people who went to bed hungry, who lost land to the tax collector, who worked to exhaustion and ill-health, who faced pain and relocation with the bitter stoicism we call, in Japanese, ""gaman."" Many who came the hard road of our ancestors didn't make it. Their bones are still in the mountains by the tunnels they blasted for the railroad, still in the fields where they stooped over the short-handled hoe, still in the graveyards of Europe, where they fought for a democracy that didn't include them. Asian success was success with a dark, painful price. 

To use that success to discount the hardship facing poor and working people in this country today is a sacrilege to the memory of our ancestors. It is an insult to today's Asian-American immigrants, who work the double-triple shift, who know no leisure, who crowd two and three families to a home, who put children and old-folks alike to work at struggling family businesses or at home doing piece-work until midnight. Yes, we take pride in our success, but we should also remember the cost. The success that is our pride is not to be given over as a weapon to use against other struggling communities. I hope we will not be used to blame the poor for their poverty.

Nor should we be used to deny employment or educational opportunities to others.  A recent exchange of editorials and letters in the Asian-American press reveals confusion over affirmative action.  Racist anti-Asian quotas at the universities can give quotas a bad name in our community. At the same time, quotas have been the only way we've been able to walk through the door of persistently discriminatory institutions like the San Francisco fire department.  

We need affirmative action because there are still employers who see an Asian face and see a person unfit for a leadership position. In every field where we have attained a measure of success, we are underrepresented in the real power positions. And yet, we are in danger of being manipulated into opposing affirmative action by those who say affirmative action hurts Asian-Americans. 

What's really going on here? When university administrators have secret quotas to keep down Asian admissions, this is because Asians are seen as destroying the predominantly white character of the university. Under this mentality, we can't let in all those Asian over-achievers and maintain affirmative action for other minority groups. We can't do both because that will mean either that our universities lose their predominantly white character, or that we have to fund more and better universities. To either of those prospects, I say, ""why not?"" And I condemn the voices from our own community that are translating legitimate anger at ceilings on Asian admissions into unthinking opposition to affirmative action floors needed to fight racism.

In a period when rates of educational attainment for minorities and working class Americans are going down, in a period when America is lagging behind other developed nations in literacy and learning, I hope we will not be used to deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.

Another classic way to use the racial bourgeoisie is as America's punching bag. There is a lot of rage in this country, and for good reason. Our economy is in shambles. Persistent unemployment is creating new ghost towns, new soup kitchens, from coast to coast. The symptoms of decay--the drugs, the homelessness, the violence--are everywhere. From out of this decay comes a rage looking for a scapegoat, and a traditional American scapegoat is the oriental menace. From the Workingman's Party that organized white laborers around an anti-Chinese campaign in California in 1877, to the World War II internment fueled by resentment of the success of issei farmers, to the murder of Vincent Chin, to the terrorizing of Korean merchants in ghetto communities today, there is an unbroken line of poor and working Americans turning their anger and frustration into hatred of Asian-Americans. 

Every time this happens, the real villains--the corporations and politicians who put profits before human needs--are allowed to go about their business free from public scrutiny. And the anger that could go to organizing for positive social change goes instead to Asian-bashing.

Will we be used as America's punching bag? We can prevent this by organizing to publicize and to fight racist speech and racist violence wherever we find it. More importantly, however, Asian-Americans must take a prominent role in advocating economic justice. We must show that Asian-Americans are allies of the working poor, of the unemployed, of the ghetto teenager. If we can show our commitment to ending the economic upheaval that feeds anti-Asian sentiment, the displaced rage that terrorizes Asian-Americans will turn upon more deserving targets. If we can show sensitivity to the culture and needs of other people of color when we do business in their communities, we will maintain our welcome there, as we have in the past. I hope we can do this so we can put an end to being used as America's punching bag.

The problem of displaced anger is also an internal problem for Asian- Americans. You know the story: the Japanese pick on the Okinawans; the Chinese pick on the Filipinos; the Samoans pick on the Laotians. On the plantations we scabbed on each other's strikes. In Chinatown, we've competed over space. There are Asian men who batter Asian women, Asian parents who batter their children. There is homophobia in our communities--tied to a deep fear that we are already so marginalized by white society that any additional difference is intolerable. I've heard of straight Asian men say they feel so emasculated by white society, that they cannot tolerate assertive women or sexually ambiguous men. This is a victim's mentality; the tragic symptom of a community so devoid of self respect that it brings its anger home.

I love my Asian brothers, but I've lost my patience with malingering homophobia and sexism, and especially with using white racism as an excuse to resist change. You know, the ""I have to be Bruce Lee because the white man wants me to be Tonto"" line. Yes, the J-town boys with their black leather jackets are adorable, but the pathetic need to put down straight women, gays, and lesbians is not. To anyone in our communities who wants to bring their anger home, let's say, ""cut it out."" We will not be used against each other.

If you know Hawaiian music, you know of the ha'ina line that tells of a song about to end. This speech is about to end. It will end by recalling echoes of Asian-American resistance.

In anti-eviction struggles in Chinatowns from coast to coast and in Hawaii we heard the song, ""We Shall Not Be Moved.""  For the 90's, I want to sing, ""We Shall Not Be Used."" I want to remember the times when Asian-Americans stood side-by-side with African-Americans, Latinos, and progressive whites to demand social justice. I want to remember the multi-racial ILWU (International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Workers' Union) that ended the plantation system in Hawaii.  I want to remember the multi-racial sugar beet strikes in California that brought together Japanese, Filipino and Chicano workers to fulfill their dreams of a better life.  I want to remember the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born that brought together progressive Okinawan, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and European immigrants to fight McCarthyism and deportation of political activists.  I want to remember the San Francisco State College strike, and the Asian-American students who stood their ground in a multi-racial coalition to bring about ethnic studies and lasting changes in American academic life, changes that make it possible for me, as a scholar, to tell the truth as I see it.

In remembering the San Francisco State strike, I also want to remember Dr. Hayakawa and ask what he represented.  For a variety of historical and cultural reasons, Asian-Americans are particularly susceptible to being used by the dominant society. Nonetheless, we have resisted being used; we have joined time and again in the struggle for democracy in America. The Asian Law Caucus represents that tradition.

When I told a friend about this speech, he sent me a newsclipping from the Chronicle about Asian-Americans as the retailer's dream.

But I hope there is more to Asian-American identity than that. I hope we will be known to history as a people who remembered the hard road of their ancestors, and who shared, therefore, a special commitment to social justice.

American lawyer, activist, and law professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii. Prior to her return to Hawaii, Matsuda was a professor at the UCLA School of Law and Georgetown University Law Center, specializing in the fields of torts, constitutional law, legal history, feminist theory, critical race theory, and civil rights law.

Based on an April 1990 address to the Asian Law Caucus, first published February 1993
 
An essay I came across from Matsudas Where Is Your Body? And Other Essays on Race, Gender, and the Law.


*The Asian Law Caucus is the original public interest law firm serving the Asian-American community. It was built up from scratch by young, radical lawyers who carried files in their car trunks and stayed up all night to type their own briefs. The Asian Law Caucus has changed the lives of many-poor and working people, immigrants, and troubled youth - the least advantaged in the Asian-American community. The Caucus has also made history, successfully bringing landmark cases that have changed the law and the legal system. The supporters of the Caucus include many who participated in the civil rights and antiwar movements and who have worked all their lives in coalition with other people of color. This history is what inspired the words below, delivered at a fund-raising banquet in April 1990.*

It is a special honor to address supporters of the Asian Law Caucus. Here, before this audience, I am willing to speak in the tradition of our women warriors, to go beyond the platitudes of fundraiser formalism, and to talk of something that's been bothering me and that I need your help on. I want to speak of my fear that Asian-Americans are in danger of becoming the racial bourgeoisie, and of my resolve to resist that path. 

Marx wrote of the economic bourgeoisie -- the small merchants, the middle class, the baby capitalists--who were deeply confused about their self-interest. The bourgeoisie, he said, often emulate the manners and the ideology of the big-time capitalists. They are the wannabes of capitalism. Struggling for riches, often failing, confused about the reasons why, the economic wannabes go to their graves thinking that the big hit is right around the corner.

Living in 19th century Europe, Marx thought mostly in terms of class. Living in 20th century America, in the land where racism found a home, I am thinking about race. Is there a racial equivalent of the economic bourgeoisie? I fear there may be, and I fear it may be us.

If white, historically, is the top of the racial hierarchy in America, and black, historically, is the bottom, will yellow assume the place of the racial middle? The role of the racial middle is a critical one. It can reinforce white supremacy if the middle deludes itself into thinking it can be just like white if it tries hard enough. Conversely, the middle can dismantle white supremacy if it refuses to be the middle, if it refuses to buy into racial hierarchy, if it refuses to abandon communities of Black and Brown people, choosing instead to form alliances with them.

The theme of the unconventional fundraiser talk you are listening to is, ""we will not be used."" It is a plea to Asian-Americans to think about the ways in which our communities are particularly susceptible to playing the worst version of the racial bourgeoisie role.

In thinking this, I remember my mother's stories of growing up on a sugar plantation on Kauai. She tells of the Portuguese luna or overseer. The luna rode on a big horse and ordered the Japanese and Filipino workers around. The luna in my mother's stories is a tragic-comic figure. He thinks he is better than the other workers, but he doesn't realize that the plantation owner considers the luna sub-human, just like the other workers. The stereotype of the dumb portagee persists in Hawaii today, a holdover from the days of the luna parading around the big house, cloaked in self-delusion and false pride.

The double tragedy for the plantation nisei who hated the luna is that the sansei in Hawaii are becoming the new luna. Nice Japanese girls from Manoa Valley are going through four years of college to get degrees in Travel Industry Management, in order to sit behind a small desk in a big hotel, to dole out marching orders to brown-skinned workers and to take orders from a white man with a bigger desk and a bigger paycheck who never has to complicate his life by dealing with the brown people who make the beds and serve the food.  He need only deal with the Nice Japanese Girl, ex-Cherry Blossom Queen, eager to please, who doesn't know she will never make it to the bigger desk.

The portagee luna now has the last laugh with this new unfunny portagee joke: when the portagee was the luna, he didn't have to pay college tuition to ride that horse.

I'd like to say to my sister behind the small desk, ""remember where you came from and take this pledge: we will not be used.""

There are one hundred ways to use the racial bourgeoisie. Here are some examples:

When Asian-Americans manage to do well, their success is used against others. Internally, it is used to erase the continuing poverty and social dislocation within Asian-American communities. The media is full of stories of Asian-American whiz kids. Their successes are used to erase our problems and to disavow any responsibility for them. The dominant culture doesn't know about drug abuse in our communities, about our high school dropouts, our AIDS victims.

Suggestions that some segments of the Asian-American community need special help are greeted with suspicion and disbelief. External to our communities, our successes are used to deny racism and to put down other groups. African-Americans and Latinos and poor whites are told, ""look at those Asians--anyone can make it in this country if they really try."" The cruelty of telling this to crack babies, to workers displaced by runaway shops, and to families waiting in line at homeless shelters, is not something I want associated with my genealogy. 

Yes, my ancestors made it in this country, but they made it against the odds. In my genealogy and probably in yours, are people who went to bed hungry, who lost land to the tax collector, who worked to exhaustion and ill-health, who faced pain and relocation with the bitter stoicism we call, in Japanese, ""gaman."" Many who came the hard road of our ancestors didn't make it. Their bones are still in the mountains by the tunnels they blasted for the railroad, still in the fields where they stooped over the short-handled hoe, still in the graveyards of Europe, where they fought for a democracy that didn't include them. Asian success was success with a dark, painful price. 

To use that success to discount the hardship facing poor and working people in this country today is a sacrilege to the memory of our ancestors. It is an insult to today's Asian-American immigrants, who work the double-triple shift, who know no leisure, who crowd two and three families to a home, who put children and old-folks alike to work at struggling family businesses or at home doing piece-work until midnight. Yes, we take pride in our success, but we should also remember the cost. The success that is our pride is not to be given over as a weapon to use against other struggling communities. I hope we will not be used to blame the poor for their poverty.

Nor should we be used to deny employment or educational opportunities to others.  A recent exchange of editorials and letters in the Asian-American press reveals confusion over affirmative action.  Racist anti-Asian quotas at the universities can give quotas a bad name in our community. At the same time, quotas have been the only way we've been able to walk through the door of persistently discriminatory institutions like the San Francisco fire department.  

We need affirmative action because there are still employers who see an Asian face and see a person unfit for a leadership position. In every field where we have attained a measure of success, we are underrepresented in the real power positions. And yet, we are in danger of being manipulated into opposing affirmative action by those who say affirmative action hurts Asian-Americans. 

What's really going on here? When university administrators have secret quotas to keep down Asian admissions, this is because Asians are seen as destroying the predominantly white character of the university. Under this mentality, we can't let in all those Asian over-achievers and maintain affirmative action for other minority groups. We can't do both because that will mean either that our universities lose their predominantly white character, or that we have to fund more and better universities. To either of those prospects, I say, ""why not?"" And I condemn the voices from our own community that are translating legitimate anger at ceilings on Asian admissions into unthinking opposition to affirmative action floors needed to fight racism.

In a period when rates of educational attainment for minorities and working class Americans are going down, in a period when America is lagging behind other developed nations in literacy and learning, I hope we will not be used to deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.

Another classic way to use the racial bourgeoisie is as America's punching bag. There is a lot of rage in this country, and for good reason. Our economy is in shambles. Persistent unemployment is creating new ghost towns, new soup kitchens, from coast to coast. The symptoms of decay--the drugs, the homelessness, the violence--are everywhere. From out of this decay comes a rage looking for a scapegoat, and a traditional American scapegoat is the oriental menace. From the Workingman's Party that organized white laborers around an anti-Chinese campaign in California in 1877, to the World War II internment fueled by resentment of the success of issei farmers, to the murder of Vincent Chin, to the terrorizing of Korean merchants in ghetto communities today, there is an unbroken line of poor and working Americans turning their anger and frustration into hatred of Asian-Americans. 

Every time this happens, the real villains--the corporations and politicians who put profits before human needs--are allowed to go about their business free from public scrutiny. And the anger that could go to organizing for positive social change goes instead to Asian-bashing.

Will we be used as America's punching bag? We can prevent this by organizing to publicize and to fight racist speech and racist violence wherever we find it. More importantly, however, Asian-Americans must take a prominent role in advocating economic justice. We must show that Asian-Americans are allies of the working poor, of the unemployed, of the ghetto teenager. If we can show our commitment to ending the economic upheaval that feeds anti-Asian sentiment, the displaced rage that terrorizes Asian-Americans will turn upon more deserving targets. If we can show sensitivity to the culture and needs of other people of color when we do business in their communities, we will maintain our welcome there, as we have in the past. I hope we can do this so we can put an end to being used as America's punching bag.

The problem of displaced anger is also an internal problem for Asian- Americans. You know the story: the Japanese pick on the Okinawans; the Chinese pick on the Filipinos; the Samoans pick on the Laotians. On the plantations we scabbed on each other's strikes. In Chinatown, we've competed over space. There are Asian men who batter Asian women, Asian parents who batter their children. There is homophobia in our communities--tied to a deep fear that we are already so marginalized by white society that any additional difference is intolerable. I've heard of straight Asian men say they feel so emasculated by white society, that they cannot tolerate assertive women or sexually ambiguous men. This is a victim's mentality; the tragic symptom of a community so devoid of self respect that it brings its anger home.

I love my Asian brothers, but I've lost my patience with malingering homophobia and sexism, and especially with using white racism as an excuse to resist change. You know, the ""I have to be Bruce Lee because the white man wants me to be Tonto"" line. Yes, the J-town boys with their black leather jackets are adorable, but the pathetic need to put down straight women, gays, and lesbians is not. To anyone in our communities who wants to bring their anger home, let's say, ""cut it out."" We will not be used against each other.

If you know Hawaiian music, you know of the ha'ina line that tells of a song about to end. This speech is about to end. It will end by recalling echoes of Asian-American resistance.

In anti-eviction struggles in Chinatowns from coast to coast and in Hawaii we heard the song, ""We Shall Not Be Moved.""  For the 90's, I want to sing, ""We Shall Not Be Used."" I want to remember the times when Asian-Americans stood side-by-side with African-Americans, Latinos, and progressive whites to demand social justice. I want to remember the multi-racial ILWU (International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Workers' Union) that ended the plantation system in Hawaii.  I want to remember the multi-racial sugar beet strikes in California that brought together Japanese, Filipino and Chicano workers to fulfill their dreams of a better life.  I want to remember the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born that brought together progressive Okinawan, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and European immigrants to fight McCarthyism and deportation of political activists.  I want to remember the San Francisco State College strike, and the Asian-American students who stood their ground in a multi-racial coalition to bring about ethnic studies and lasting changes in American academic life, changes that make it possible for me, as a scholar, to tell the truth as I see it.

In remembering the San Francisco State strike, I also want to remember Dr. Hayakawa and ask what he represented.  For a variety of historical and cultural reasons, Asian-Americans are particularly susceptible to being used by the dominant society. Nonetheless, we have resisted being used; we have joined time and again in the struggle for democracy in America. The Asian Law Caucus represents that tradition. The Caucus is a concrete manifestation of the pledge to seek a better life for the least advantaged and to work in coalition with other groups. All of you who support the Caucus help keep alive a utopian vision of a world free from racism and poverty. You honor the proudest moments in our collective histories.

"2020-01-03",1578025850,"32yo MD, PhD post-doc, struggling to see a path forward for a career in research, asking for some advice.","I'm a 32 year old post-doc from Europe (MD, PhD, resident in Pathology) in a successful cancer research lab at a prestigious US university. Previous post-docs in the lab were able to do multiple, different projects, as in the beginning, the PI was dependent on collaborations with other researchers. The PI is very well-known in the field I thought that I would be able to learn a lot in the lab. I was initially put on a project, where the PI got a lot of money for, however collaborators did not provide the required specimens (cancer tissues). Initially, I also contributed tissue from my university in Europe, but this was not enough. Although i was not told before I was in the lab, I was hired to do micro-dissection on the samples for this project (since I am a resident in pathology). However, a year after I started, another project was published in one of the CNS journals and all focus  moved to that project: a company was founded and everybody is working on validating the initial study (often brainless work, that I think should be done in the company and not by the cheap labor of grad-students).

(I don't want to brag, but this is my honest assessment:) I'm the most qualified person in the lab: I do both all my lab work and the analyses (which are often computational intensive: I know how to program (python, R) and how to run NGS-analyses pipelines, before I joined the lab). Since my initial project failed, I'm now being used in the same 'pipeline' as grad students (but I don't get as much one-on-one time as grad-students). and I don't get the opportunity to develop my own ideas.

I have asked a researcher outside the lab for advice and he referred me to the 'Avoid Boring People'-book from James Watson (more specifically to the passage where Watson decided to leave his PI, because he didn't think he was learning the things he wanted to learn). I'm thinking of moving back to Europe with my wife (American), who also wants to leave the university (she is a research associate). When I told the PI that I might leave the lab by the end of 2020, he told me he wanted to support me later, which he has done for another post-doc, who is now a PI under him. However, the PI has never 'mentored' me and he has never given me advice. Before I joined the lab, he asked me to fill out an 8-page questionnaire, which I'm sure he never read (with questions like: ""where do you see yourself in 5 years""). In the year before I joined the lab, I had thought about 2-3 projects which I wanted to propose, but he has never had time to listen to them and give his views on them. I don't want to be grand-fathered into a position without having a good paper by myself: these promises in the future set me up for a subordinate role where I can't develop my ideas and where I have to subscribe to the scientific consensus. I know my pathology and computational biology skills are in high-demand and I might have gone to a 'too-good' lab that doesn't value me. I feel like a failure, but I'm also eager to proof that I can be successful, even in a market with less grant-money, like the EU. I still very much respect my PI for his scientific achievements and his vision. But the lack of investment in the 'future' like in young researchers, bothers me. It hate how the reward system works for PIs: risky projects where only a small percentage succeed, are better for a PI than helping all their grad-students and post-docs succeed in their dreams of a scientific career. I have spoken with some of the bright grad-students and post-docs, who have expressed similar complaints.

I'm generally disappointed in research: it has become industrial and top-down, which makes it very uninteresting for grad-students and post-docs. In Europe, I had very interesting and intellectual and conceptual discussions with my bosses, about how to do elegant and creative research. In the US institute where I'm now, it is about processing hundreds of samples and being a brainless robot. I see how people who are brainless robots and who have no creative mind at all, have been promoted to tenure-track positions. They don't get any national grants and live from the money from millionaires who were directed to them by the head of the department, who 'believes' in these brainless robots (sometimes because of positive discrimination/affirmative action). It is easier to convince a millionaire who cannot assess how good the research-proposal is, to give money, then to convince your peers...","academia",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/eja7tv/32yo_md_phd_postdoc_struggling_to_see_a_path/","32yo MD, PhD post-doc, struggling to see a path forward for a career in research, asking for some advice.--I'm a 32 year old post-doc from Europe (MD, PhD, resident in Pathology) in a successful cancer research lab at a prestigious US university.

However, the PI has never 'mentored' me and he has never given me advice. Before I joined the lab, he asked me to fill out an 8-page questionnaire, which I'm sure he never read (with questions like: ""where do you see yourself in 5 years""). In the year before I joined the lab, I had thought about 2-3 projects which I wanted to propose, but he has never had time to listen to them and give his views on them. I don't want to be grand-fathered into a position without having a good paper by myself: these promises in the future set me up for a subordinate role where I can't develop my ideas and where I have to subscribe to the scientific consensus. I know my pathology and computational biology skills are in high-demand and I might have gone to a 'too-good' lab that doesn't value me. I feel like a failure, but I'm also eager to proof that I can be successful, even in a market with less grant-money, like the EU. I still very much respect my PI for his scientific achievements and his vision. But the lack of investment in the 'future' like in young researchers, bothers me. It hate how the reward system works for PIs: risky projects where only a small percentage succeed, are better for a PI than helping all their grad-students and post-docs succeed in their dreams of a scientific career. I have spoken with some of the bright grad-students and post-docs, who have expressed similar complaints.

I'm generally disappointed in research: it has become industrial and top-down, which makes it very uninteresting for grad-students and post-docs. In Europe, I had very interesting and intellectual and conceptual discussions with my bosses, about how to do elegant and creative research. In the US institute where I'm now, it is about processing hundreds of samples and being a brainless robot. I see how people who are brainless robots and who have no creative mind at all, have been promoted to tenure-track positions. They don't get any national grants and live from the money from millionaires who were directed to them by the head of the department, who 'believes' in these brainless robots (sometimes because of positive discrimination/affirmative action). It is easier to convince a millionaire who cannot assess how good the research-proposal is, to give money, then to convince your peers...",22
