At a time where many university students are examining the role of race in places of elite and privileged learning, many on this forum have asked what our role as AAs are among other minority groups. 

One of the things to highlight may be how elite institutions (e.g. the Ivy League), have put into place discriminatory quotas in AA admissions. Several peer reviewed academic papers have concluded that there is very real statistical evidence that such a quota exists (ironically, the more heavily cited ones come from Princeton). 

Perhaps if we too are to join other PoC in their fight, perhaps our place is to also ask elite institutions for transparency. The Ivy League notoriously keeps admissions statistics private, however, if they are to have a fair and balanced admission strategy, perhaps they too should not worry about releasing the GPAs, SATs, and other factors by race.

"2018-10-15",1539619742,"Asian-Americans and Harvard: Dispelling the myths","Now that ""the trial"" is underway, there have been so many inaccurate statements on this sub about that cold-hard-facts. Some facts:

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&amp;#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&amp;#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot. If you have economics or statistics training, please see my detailed explanation in this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian\_bias\_not\_affirmative\_action\_is\_on\_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian_bias_not_affirmative_action_is_on_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3)

Why is it, AGAIN, Democrats refused to agree to a balanced budge amendment, instead opting to raise the debt ceiling in lieu of slashing wasteful programs?

If the truth be known, our government is bankrupt - printing money to cover its socialist projects, to prop-up our over-speculated markets - and yet Barack Obama still hasnt added one ""net"" job during his lavish spending spree; actually, hes lost over two million.

Sorry, Mr. Clinton, because liberalism is a mental disorder, neither prescribed nor protected under the Constitution, your ridiculous claim is denied!

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

{snip}

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}
