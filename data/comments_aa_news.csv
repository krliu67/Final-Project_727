Without it, you'd need to pick Supreme Court justices with no work experience. Roe would have died 20 Yeats ago, because RBG worked for Planned Parenthood before becoming a Justice. You also would have rampant cases of 4 Justices purposefully picking cases with conflicts to win with minority votes.

If this was a 5/4, Jackson probably wouldn't have refused herself creating a 4/4  tie that would have caused Affirmative Action to die in 60% of the country (lower courts would pick from either decision in what to follow). It would be silly that Constitutional rights are mostly dependent on a Justices resume, when we clearly see its not like her history with Harvard is changing her mind.

&gt; The assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 was a turning point, with students pushing colleges to redouble their efforts to be more representative of American society. Less than four weeks after Dr. Kings death, Harvards dean of admissions announced a commitment to enrolling a substantially higher number of Black students than in the past.

&gt; The dean said that a student who had survived the hazards of poverty, was intellectually thirsty and had room for growth, would be given preference, Dr. Karabel recounts.

&gt; For the Harvard class admitted in 1969, Black enrollment jumped. Of the 1,202 freshmen in the class, 90 were African American, up from 51 in 1968, a 76 percent increase, according to Dr. Karabel. Competitors like Yale, Princeton and Columbia also stepped up efforts to enroll Black students.","3_1_2_1_3_1"

Edit: so the military has a distinct interest in a certain ethnicity makeup, which can be considered, but when an educational institution has their own distinct interest in a certain ethnicity makeup, that cannot be considered.

I get that the distinct interests are different, but that doesnt get over the point of whether or not AA can or cannot be a moral thing for one institution vs another.

They assert that universities are owed deference when using race to
benefit some applicants but not others. While this Court has recog-
nized a tradition of giving a degree of deference to a universitys aca-
demic decisions, it has made clear that deference must exist within
constitutionally prescribed limits. Grutter, 539 U. S., at 328. Re-
spondents have failed to present an exceedingly persuasive justifica-
tion for separating students on the basis of race that is measurable
and concrete enough to permit judicial review, as the Equal Protection
Clause requires.

And

&gt; College admissions are zero-
sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others nec-
essarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.
Respondents admissions programs are infirm for a second reason as
well: They require stereotypingthe very thing Grutter foreswore.
When a university admits students on the basis of race, it engages in
the offensive and demeaning assumption that [students] of a particu-
lar race, because of their race, think alike.

**AND**

&gt; Respondents admissions programs also lack a logical end
point as Grutter required. 539 U. S., at 342. Respondents suggest
that the end of race-based admissions programs will occur once mean-
ingful representation and diversity are achieved on college campuses.
Such measures of success amount to little more than comparing the
racial breakdown of the incoming class and comparing it to some other
metric, such as the racial makeup of the previous incoming class or the
population in general, to see whether some proportional goal has been
reached. **The problem with this approach is well established:
[O]utright racial balancing is patently unconstitutional.**

Emphasis mine.

The opinion is much longer, but this excerpt highlights the core of the issue. Affirmative action intended to do good, but did so ideologically, and has no empirical end state that satisfies its initiation. This led to broad scale racial discrimination and grouped individuals into stereotypes and deselected them from success paths.

There is an entire demographic of Asian Americans whose parents or grandparents came to this country specifically to get a degree from a top university within the past 100 years. 

The Chinese Exclusion Act [did not actually affect Chinese students, diplomats, or wealthy businessmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act). Those people were still let in and started families, and although they didn't start becoming a significant portion of the US population until the 1960s, there are some Asian Americans who are descended from Asians who attended Ivy's in the 1920s or 30s. I.M. Pei was a notable example of someone like this. All his descendants are legacies now.","4_2_1_1_1"

That's true, but it ignores the fact that race affects one's place in the economy due to the fact that race did actually matter a lot for the longest time, and the field wasn't leveled once the impact of race was finally reduced.

I'm not saying that means we should skip a few steps and therefore base it on race or ethnicity. Certainly, basing it on poverty is absolutely the best way forward.

Black people are disproportionately poor due to the historical legacy of slavery, redlining, segregation and continued injustices like disproportional arrest, prosecution and sentencing of drug crimes.

Therefore, any measures focused on helping poor people will also be of disproportionate benefit to black people since more of them are poor than other races.

It's already baked in. Same for if you have a policy of making reparations to victims of the drug war.

A doctor who maybe scored lower on tests but isn't chock full of implicit biases that will reduce the quality of my care is absolutely preferable to me.

In addition to poverty is the high degree of discrimination and wildly different experiences that Black and Brown folks have faced over generations and today as compared to White folks. 

Researchers have done audit studies where they would have a Black and White person or family with the exact same credentials and income apply for the same job, apartment, loan, etc. and there's a statistically significant favor for the White person or family. So it's not just about poverty.

Applicants can still talk about their adversity, race and cultural backgrounds in their essays to express their individuality and how they can contribute to the schools they are applying to.

In Texas, after the Hopwood decision they created a Top 10% rule.  On the face of it, sounds good, top 10% of graduating class in any public state school gets automatic admit into any public University here.

However, it caused a lot of problems.  In addition to not taking into account the disparity in quality of education between high schools (for instance I was barely inside the Top 25% of my graduating class but had I transferred to the other school in our district, I would have been Top 10%), it caused a serious problem with admissions.

The University ran into a problem.  At one point 86% of the freshman class were automatic admits. With top business and engineering schools, top 10% enrollees overwhelmingly chose those schools.  They literally had trouble filling majors because they just didn't have enough admittance spots.  And even if you wanted to admit some art prodigy, who otherwise had mediocre grades, the competition on holistic reviews was, and remains, fierce.

That's not even getting into the issue of diversity of the student body.  Even though poorer schools were getting automatic admits with often lesser grades, the simple cost of school was too much, so the freshman class would be dominated by kids from high social economic backgrounds. 

Eventually, UT was able to get the automatic admits limited to 2/3 of the freshman class, which equates to Top 6% currently.  It's helped a ton in keeping a diverse student body (not just racially, but socio economic, majors, etc.) but it's still problematic.

And of course our biggest problem is that we really only have two Tier 1 public Universities here, Texas and A&amp;M.  They done a good amount of work on UTD, UTSAand UH, but they just aren't to the same caliber.","28"

I went to a district in Texas that did NOT give any extra gpa credit for AP level courses, which is not the norm for texas schools. Normally they give 0.5-1 extra GPA point in consideration for the added difficulty.

We were also *deducted* a gpa point for any class falling in the ""minimum"" level classes (i.e. for those behind in curriculum) however, *this also included ALL FINE ARTS and some ATHLETIC COURSES*

So in short, my district (one of the largest in texas), punished students for taking AP and elective courses. In order to get in top 10%, students would play the GPA game by taking no fine arts and no AP to try to keep their grades as high as possible.

I was lucky and A&amp;M was accepting students for ACT/SAT test scores only so despite being top 11% (for taking fine arts for 4 years), I was accepted, but many of my peers who were squeezed out were graduating without automatic acceptance, no college credits, few extra curriculars because they didn't want them effecting their grades, and now had subpar college applications.

Ultimately because for an elite school like Harvard you have (made up numbers) 100 admissions slots but 10,000 applicants who all have the same academic prowess, so you have to make the determining decision based on... *something*.

Midkiff* (1984). Basically, the potential landowners got the Hawaii Housing Authority to force the eminent domain transfer of leasehold land held by KS (AKa the Bishop Estate) to the private parties, which was a weird thing to do with eminent domain, something normally used to transfer land to the government for the greater public good. 

They could do this because the Hawaii State Legislature had passed a law saying HHA could condemn properties to transfer them from powerful landholders to their occupants. The argument from the legislature was that converting the land to individual owners would lower the cost of land and housing in Hawaii, and was thus in the interest of the greater public. 

When HHA tried to do this to the Bishop Estate, they sued and argued the law was unconstitutional. It was appealed to SCOTUS, who deemed it constitutional in an 8-0 decision. 

But the land conversions didn't help the cost of land or housing and made it worse because the individual beneficiaries of the eminent domain turned around and sold their homes to Japanese investors (the 1980-90s were a time of greater affluence in Japan and they really love Hawaii). The decision has actually been used to do some pretty shitty eminent domain all over the country. Like when Foxconn made that dumb factory of nothing in Wisconsin, the government used eminent domain to condemn people's homes and transfer the land to Foxconn, for the greater ""public use.""

Edit: Another landmark case regarding eminent domain is *Kelo v. City of New London* (2005), where the city of New London wanted to condemn a private citizen's properties to have Pfizer develop a plant there, which SCOTUS decided for the city 5-4. This is what established the economic ""public use"" aspect of eminent domain between private parties. Pfizer never developed the lot, which remains bulldozed and empty.","1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

They have a lot of resources that are kept locked away for people who are willing to submit to their Hawaiian-Christian culture.

They do more good than bad, but it's hard to make comparisons when they own so many unique resources (like historical documentation) that other schools will never have access to.  But at the end of the day they were built via religious and cultural oppression, and death.

If you invest the money into relativly safe assets like a bank does (back mortgages, govt bonts, AA/AAA corp bonds) and use only the fraction of the intrest above inflation (usually ~1-3%) per year, then the total real world value of the endowment will never go down. You can spend money yearly without losing any money.

Its like putting a one-time price tag on an infinite stream of yearly payments - its possible with compounding intrest, so if you want to start a $100k/year scholarship program, you have to donate ~$4-8m.

This means that their $51b total is roughly $1.5b/yr of annual budget. That plus tuition revenue is the total amount of money the university runs on.

It's just expected that you have multiple courses worth of lectures ready to go when you apply for academic jobs. 

I have been in some faculty meetings at one of the schools on that list, where they discussed efforts by the university to get them to do what you said, and the professors were 100% against it. Their view was that it was the first step to sidelining them and just having everything be a virtual lecture (pre-pandemic).

Wrong. 55% of students receive need-based scholarships, meaning family income under $150K, and 19% are on federal Pell Grants. This percentage is about the same as USC or NYU, but much higher than Creighton (10%), Notre Dame (12%), Auburn (12%), TCU (13%), Villanova (12%), SMU (12%), Baylor (14%), Wake Forest (9%), or Tulane (8%).

People with families that make over $150k also qualify as those who get aid. So if your parents made 300 and have to pay 20% thats only
60K meaning Harvard covers the rest, and you count as an aid recipient. (Im sure you could find the exact &gt;150k gradient somewhere.)

Harvard is just smarter at marketing their program.

Case point being that you though it applies exclusively to those with sub $150k families.

Now Ill agree that theyre more inclusive than most other ivy colleges.  But that leads back to my original point, they do that to get the best of the best.","2_2_1_2_1"

The thing is, the actual cost (in terms of looking at the uni's expenses divided by student count) at these highly selective elite universities is closer to $250K/yr per student--so even those paying full tuition &amp; fees are being subsidized by investment returns &amp; highly generous donors.","2_2_1_2_1_1"

(i) a STEM course taught by an instructor (and by assistants) at the peak of their field; who have an untrainable knack for pedagogy;  who were likely themselves taught by excellent instructors; who have copious and well paid and well managed staff; teaching to kids who are fed, live on campus, are emotionally mature, have healthy social lives, are suffused by a culture of curiosity and ambition; students who have done the work and have done more work than was asked; students who would not even consider cheating; students who feel good about their prospects in life; and so on

and 

(ii) a STEM course taught in a learning environment that is missing most of the above.

Students in (i) are learning *much* more than students in (ii) no matter how much the latter group may try.

But that is just my experience.  It is also what most books on pedagogy report.  No one that I know of is even writing books touting pedagogy at public institutions.  Public institutions resemble Teach for America far more than they resemble elite private institutions.  Haha!  Nothing exciting or new or inventive is happening there except for on rare occasions.  Public institutions--and only a small number of them--are doing their very best to bottle and disseminate what elite private institutions have been doing all along.  But, for a thousand reasons, they cannot figure it out; and each of their successes are won painfully and then fade away as though nothing had been gained.  Most public institutions do not even care about student education.  If anything, in these cases education happens *on accident* and so by the diligence of the student or by the grace of a talented instructor who are both working against larger cultural and institutional forces that mitigate against the richness of their overall academic lives.

It really is two worlds.  The problem is that no one--really, no one other than those belonging to the wealthy class or invited to participate in their wealth--was ever supposed to know.  Back to work, with the rest of you.  Stock those shelves.  Load that pallet.  Paint those nails.  Manage the shift schedule!  And let the simple pleasures numb you to your station.","3_1_1_9_2_1"

Any R1 institution will offer instruction by world-class experts in their fields- and beyond a certain level there's not appreciable difference in how the instructor's expertise impacts the quality of instruction. Additionally, even those who are not world-class experts are still professionals in education who take their work seriously.  


Emotionally maturity and healthy social lives are fairly arbitrary qualifiers. I've never had a student beyond first year whose emotional maturity impacted instruction and their social lives don't come up at all. I think the idea that students at prestigious institutions don't cheat is not supported by data I could find either. Looks like 14% of first year students at Yale \*admit\* to cheating and 26% say they have caught someone else cheating.   


[https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/02/07/cheating-at-yale-students-get-honest-about-academic-dishonesty/](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2019/02/07/cheating-at-yale-students-get-honest-about-academic-dishonesty/)  


I think it's strange to say that most public institutions don't care about education and I'm not sure how you come to that conclusion. I'm certain that the STEM graduates coming out of state school did in fact learn quite a bit- and not on accident.   


I think that there are many advantages to all the privilege that wealth brings, but the amount one learns from an Ivy League education is not meaningfully broader or more intensive than other R1 institutions. In fact, many public institutions outrank Ivy League schools in undergraduate education quality (albeit rankings are often reductive and imperfect).","3_1_1_9_2_1_1"

Harvard is a private institution. Private institutions are permitted to admit or exclude members for any reason not explicitly prohibited in the constitution.

The only reason that discriminating based on race was struck down was because we passed a constitutional amendment outlawing it.

Roughly twenty-five years ago, the Supreme Court temporarily permitted racial discrimination in admissions, under the stipulation that it was to correct previous injustices, and that any such programs would be self-terminating after making progress towards that goal.

They reviewed it again this year, found it was not following either prior stipulation, and so ended the exception.

And just to nip this in the bud, the fact that most white students dont benefit from legacy admission doesnt change the fact that most people who benefit from legacy admission are white. And the reason most people who benefit from legacy admission are white is because historically the only colleges that didnt discriminate against black people were colleges created for black people by black people.

HBCUs exist because up until 1964 colleges could just refuse to admit black students and hire black faculty. And Affirmative Action exists because after 1964 the same colleges that discriminated against black students just cloaked their discrimination under dozens of layers of plausible deniability.

Racism didnt just vanish in 1964, racist just got better at cloaking their racism and we all just decided to pretend it was some strange coincidence that resumes and rent applications with black sounding names always got moved to the bottom of the list. Because after all nobody can prove that it was racially motivated and it would be wrong to assume malicious intent.","3_11"

I don't think winning this suit would work out the way these groups apparently think it will.

At least by the rather crude way we currently define racial categories.

Academics are an equalizing force in America. If you have good grades and score highly on the SAT/ACT, you are virtually guaranteed admission into your state's flagship state university. And if you graduate from that university your chances of entering the upper middle class (or beyond) are very high. It would be a bad thing to get rid of or reduce the importance of standardized tests. 

Furthermore, if rich people can pay for tutors they can pay for other experiences that make their kids stand out on an application. If you lessen the importance of standardized tests that just helps rich students even more.

I've never read a more serious, yet totally nonsensical line on reddit. If you can learn, practice, and improve your own method of taking the SAT such that you achieve a higher SAT score... that is the very *definition* of merit based.

The same is true for the ACT, MCAT, LSAT, and so on. If you practice and do better, that is literally your merit, your efforts on studying getting you there. So what you said is literally asinine (but somehow got upvoted?)

Perhaps what you meant to say is ""SAT scores, like all test scores (assuming the test itself is appropriate and there is no foul play when grading), are merit based, but wealthy people tend to have an advantage in both time and materials for SAT prep, making the SAT an imperfect measure of merit that necessitates a more holistic approach when evaluating student applications.""","6_3_6_1_3_2"

This is, in fact, a lie. Regardless of whether you believe it is constitutional or not, doing your own research on grutter vs bollinger will reveal that the 2003 case decided that affirmative action is NOT unconstitutional under the 14th amendment, as long as other factors are involved

In the majority opinion of this case, the judges wrote that they didnt expect affirmative action to be needed forever to promote diversity. They write that they EXPECT it to take 25 years for it to no longer be necessary. 

The 2023 court decision leaves out the word expect, as well as other important context, and implies that the 2003 case did find affirmative action to be unconstitutional (which it definitely did not). If you read the first page of the 2023 doc, youll find that no part saying that affirmative action is unconstitutional is actually quoted. 

Ill post a link below to more reading about the 2003 grutter v bollinger case. Its ok if you dont necessarily agree with it, but to say that affirmative action has always been seen as unconstitutional under the 14th amendment is actually a lie that many people are telling unintentionally, as they blindly trust the current Supreme Court. Dont let these people rewrite history on us. 

Edit: you can disagree with me all you want but the court findings were based on a broken quote from the majority opinion. Ignoring the fact that they butchered the quote and left out context, details from a majority opinion are known as dicta and are not legally binding. The only binding precedent set by grutter vs bollinger is that affirmative action does not violate the 14th amendment as long as other factors are taken into account. This is a fact about the court case and youll find it by doing your own research on grutter vs bollinger. Im not asking you to blindly trust democrats or republicans.

No, you are reading it incorrectly.  

The majority opinion details how Harvard and UNC failed the standards set in Gruter (No timeframe as to when AA would be sunsetted, no measures they could provide as to what they were looking at to measure ""progress"" in achieving racial diversity, and that race could ""never be used as a negative""; where Harvard's ""personality score"" clearly does against Asian Americans).

Should have been like this in the first place. Going after legacy admissions. Not allowing these institutions to hide behind policies like Affirmative Action.

As an Asian, I would have needed a 3.89 and a 35 (!) to have the same chance of acceptance as this black student. 


I HATE this institutional racism. I understand that socioeconomic class can put people at a disadvantage and that should be taken into account. But routinely med schools discriminate solely on skin color all in the effort to be more diverse.

Being a doctor involves so much more than knowing what drug to prescribe a patient - to give the most basic of examples, a Caucasian Doctor may be able to relate to a middle aged Caucasian man at risk for diabetes by understanding his lifestyle and likely having a good idea of what problem eating habits need to be eliminated. This doctor can empathize with the patient because he's probably had to fight those same habits at some point and can say more than ""you must eat healthy and exercise"" - he can come up with a feasible plan for the man to follow in order to live healthier. That Doctor is much less likely to be able to do the same for a middle aged African American woman who comes in with the same health problems but due to vastly different reasons and without the same options for lifestyle improvement - for example, gym membership because her part of town doesn't have a 24 hour fitness around every corner and even if it did she wouldn't have the resources to pay for it (driven to the doctor by her daughter). 

On top of all those hypotheticals, people can just connect better with others that they relate to - and usually racial/ethnic similarities mean a lot of common ground to start from, especially for minorities. And the better the relationship between the patient and Doctor the better the trust, and the more likely a patient is to actually listen to the doctors advice and adhere to treatments that are outlined. You may say ""well if the patient doesn't want to listen to her doctor that's her fault"" and it's fine for you to think that, but as a doctor you don't and you can't think that way. If a patient dies and her doctor thinks ""well that was her fault for not listening to me,"" that person is a terrible doctor. 

My applications are in to medical schools right now, believe me it's the most stressful thing in the world. In some cases 10k applicants for 150 spots, and I get upset when I have to tick those Caucasian and male boxes on applications - I feel like I'm testifying against myself in court or something. But at the same time I've been to many large healthcare conferences throughout my time as a post-bac fellow and without fail 80% of the people I see are white men (ironically frequently discussing issues of healthcare disparity barriers to access). 

The need for physicians to be just as diverse as the populations they treat is very real. If that means my dream of becoming a doctor ends here, then so be it.","3_2_8"

I gotta tell you, getting accepted to and succeeding in medical school is one thing. But things get more complicated when residencies are involved. I've worked in 6 different hospitals over the last two years. Almost every black resident I've worked with is African, NOT African American. And if you call them African-American, they lose their shit. They're Nigerian. They're from Ghana. Hell, just call them African, but DO NOT call them African-American. They resent it, and here's one of the reasons why:

Most of the African residents went to non-U.S. schools, which means the stakes are even higher for residency programs. They need HIGHER scores than their American counterparts. They worked their butts off, in another country, without affirmative action, and are now residents in the United States. And these weren't just pediatric residents I'm talking about. These were surgery residents and OB/GYN residents as well. You can see why an African doctor would resent being called African-American; they didn't receive any handouts.

How much better does your score have to be as a non-U.S. citizen? I'm talking about having a USMLE score that is a whole sigma-value higher than the American counterpart. If you want a general surgery residency as a foreigner, you better have a Step 1 score of 240 or higher (average step 1 is 228; SD is 18 I think?). As an  American student, you will land an orthopedic surgery or neurosurgery residency spot with that same score. You can kiss urology and dermatology residencies goodbye as well; not a single foreigner landed a urology or dematology residency last year, even though their scores were competitive enough on paper.

So chances are, that African resident that you assumed was African American and benefited from affirmative action... probably got BETTER scores than the average American student (of any ethnicity) in order to obtain the same residency spot as his/her American counterpart.

Just because somebody is black... doesn't mean they're African American. If you're gonna discriminate based on the color of their skin, read their name badge first before you open your mouth.","3_13_1"

Affirmative Action *is* using racial categories to fill admissions quotas. The school does come up with projections of how many blacks how many asians, how many whites, how many jews to admit; it does project each individual application into a statistic, and calculate that statistic's probability of falling in the 'admitted' bucket for their race. Affirmative action is designed to make it harder for asian applicants, because it's not about the individual. It's about meeting a quota for the group as aggregate. Fairness to individuals was never the concern. 

You can argue for fairness to individuals but then you're arguing in a way orthogonal to your opponent (the college administration). 

The bigger problem is the inscription of a racial category in higher education -- as if race were a well defined thing; as if blackness captured something essential about a person; or chineseness for that matter. ","3_14"

*While Asian is considered the fastest growing racial group between 2000 and 2010, Asians constitute approximately 5 percent of the U.S. population and is the third underrepresented minority group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Ironically, elite college administrators expressed concerns that they may have Student on campus ""too many"" Asians enrolled in higher education system (Jaschik, 2006). Especially after the Supreme Court's Bakke decision in 1978, a fear reaction began to spread in the Asian community as they believed that their chance of being accepted at elite universities might be limited due to their disfavored race.* **To top the fear, a National Study of College Experience led by Espenshade and Radford (2009) showed that a student who self-identifies as Asian will need 140 SAT points higher than whites, 320 SAT points higher than Hispanics, and 450 SAT points higher than African Americans.** (I added the bolding to highlight the requested information, but felt the supportin paragraph was needed for context).","4_1"

If you're really committed to promoting a program like this, then the money and focus that they're currently using to prop up unqualified black students at the college and grad school level should be diverted into pre-K and elementary schools.  Get kids while they're young, and bring them up to par with everyone else (or as much as you can given economic factors that affect all poor kids regardless of race).  Then you'll actually have a pool of qualified black candidates to pull from when it comes time for college admissions, and there will be fewer instances of black kids getting in over their heads just because it gives everyone a warm fuzzy that they're promoting ""diversity"".

The problem is, that's not a visible change right now - that's something you have to wait 10-15 years for to see the positive effects.  And we are not a country that's great at delayed gratification.

(I should add that our school did what it could to help the black students along once they were admitted.  During the summer before classes started, there was a blacks-only pre-school program where students essentially got a 6-week head start on the material.  Once school started, there were blacks-only study groups, sanctioned by the school and led by the black professors, where they basically took the students question by question through exams in advance to help them study.

I actually think this rarely happens.  Nobody objectively recognizes the unfair advantages they receive, or come up with shoddy rationalizations for why they got those entitlements.  It's like when someone who grew up in a wealthy family does well for themselves: ""Lesser"" people would have squandered that advantage, they often feel.  Basically, nobody agrees they were born on third.

While it's hardly a rigorous study, there was a social experiment where they blatantly rigged a game of Monopoly, and the effects it had on the ""rich"" player.

How is she part of the several millions that worked harder than everyone and got shafted? The best I can come up with is she went to a more competitive high school, and even then that's not really a race issue.

That's exactly why they have this rule.

Take the military for example: they're struggling with actual diversity of thought, even when accounting for race. The people that typically get promoted are the ones that don't rock the boat, strictly follow orders, take the textbook career path never trying something new, etc. Black and Hispanic service members fit this mold just like their White peers, leading to homogeneity of thought at the top regardless of race. Affirmative action may get people in to the military, but they don't progress unless they change the exact thing about them that got them accepted in the first place (""diversity of experience"").

AA is itself inherently racist - you're never going to achieve full equality until you get rid of all discrimination, positive or negative, because ultimately it has the same effect of dividing society based on skin colour. Admissions, employment and so on should be based entirely on merit, and not where you were born and to whom you were born. 

Equality of opportunity is important. Invest in the schools in poor neighbourhoods to bring them up to scratch, providing a quality education for all where individual attainment matters more than ZIP code. Make University tuition affordable - or even better, completely free - to ensure that anyone with the grades and the will can go. Make sure career guidance counselling is helpful and tailored to individual needs so that kids are on the right path early.

**Legal Background**

[*Hunter v. Erickson*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_v._Erickson)- a city council prohibited any housing ordinances discriminating based on race. The Supreme Court struck it down as a violation of Equal Protection because it found that the city had racial discrimination issues in the past and that the ordinance was put in place essentially to shut minorities out of city council discussions about housing issues in Akron.

[*Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1*](http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/457/case.html)- Law put in place by Seattle School board saying that busing (letting students in one neighborhood attend another school for a different neighborhood) for *any* reason was not allowed. The Supreme Court also struck down this law, as it found the Seattle School District historically to have racial segregation issues and that desegregation was heavily reliant on busing. The Court established the **""political process"" test** for these situations: If a legal body (1) changes a law that ""inures primarily to the benefit of a minority"" by (2) placing the decisionmaking authority of that racially beneficial law at another level of government, it violates Equal Protection.

**Factual Background**

So that sets up the tests generally for violating Equal Protection. Here's the Michigan-specific background on how this most recent case came to the Supreme Court.

Michigan affirmative action cases: [*Grutter v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger) and [*Gratz v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger). Sometime in the early 1990s, The University of Michigan established racial factors of varying degrees in their schools. The undergraduate system awarded points toward the total required for admission for being a racial minority. The law school used race as a ""plus factor"" for balancing out law classes with diverse participants. Grutter and Gratz were students that applied to the law school and undergraduate college, respectively, of the University of Michigan. Both were denied admission, are white, and claimed their denials were due to racial discrimination, essentially being on the wronged side of affirmative action. Both cases made their way to the Supreme Court, and the Court ruled on them both at the same time.

The *Grutter* case (the plus factor, but not a quota) was ruled as a valid exercise of affirmative action and that it did not violate Equal Protection because it was not a quota and was not used invidiously against any race. The *Gratz* case (providing automatic points for being a minority) was seen as a violation of Equal Protection because it provided an automatic advantage for simply being a racial minority.

In response to those Michigan cases, Grutter (and many others) petitioned across the state of Michigan to take advantage of their state constitutional right to amend the constitution via popular referendum. They proposed that the Michigan constitution be amended to prohibit any affirmative action policies by state schools in admissions. The referendum passed 58% to 42%, and was added to the Michigan constitution. 

**Current Case**

All this set the stage for the immediate case. Proponents of affirmative action argued that moving the ability to implement affirmative action programs violated the *Seattle School District* political process test as it moves the decisionmaking authority of a program that inures primarily to the benefit of a minority from the University of Michigan's Board of Directors to the Michigan constitution. This prevents minorities from even being a part of the conversation when it comes to laws that affect them the most. 

Opponents of the change argue that this is simply the political process at work. Democracy requires a majority opinion, and that opinion was heard in the form of a referendum to change the Michigan constitution. Additionally the ban prohibits all racially motivated factors from the admissions process, thus permitting a level playing field for everyone regardless of race.

The breakdown and outcome of the immediate case is as follows:

* 6 Justices voted that the affirmative action amendment, for various reasons, is valid. So the amendment stands, and for practical purposes, Michigan will remain a state that bans racial factors from admission to its public schools. 

* For legal purposes going forward, only three justices (Kennedy, Alito, and Roberts) felt that the political process test is a valid test, but that the facts of this case do not meet the standard professed in *Hunter* and *Seattle School District.* Essentially they say that the political process isn't rigged in this case, but it could be if the facts were different.

* Two justices (Scalia and Thomas) feel the political process test is improper for any set of facts and that *Hunter* and *Seattle School District* should be overruled. They state that democracy determines what is proper activity and what is not, and that so long as there is no intent to discriminate, the people in a particular area are allowed to relegate power to various levels of government at any time for any reason.

* The last justice that voted in favor of the amendment, Breyer, felt that the political process test simply did not apply to this case for very fact specific reasons that aren't important here.

So what does that mean for jurisprudence going forward? A few important points:

* The political process test is still alive and kicking. It can still be used to invalidate laws under Equal Protection.

* Affirmative action plans are still allowed generally. This case did nothing to overrule *Grutter,* and schools may still use race as a factor in admissions (so long as it doesn't violate state law; see below).

* A state may prohibit affirmative action by amending its constitution to prohibit all racial factors in the admissions processes of its state schools. The ruling is no more broad than this, it simply affirms that Michigan's new amendment followed all proper procedures and that its existence does not violate Equal Protection.

&gt; In the wake of Grutter, some voters in Michigan set out to eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies. Those voters were of course free to pursue this end in anynumber of ways. For example, they could have persuaded existing board members to change their minds through individual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through general public awareness campaigns. Or they could have mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out of office, replacing them with members who would share their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies.  When this Court holds that the Constitution permits a particular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a States voters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system of government encouragesand indeed, depends onthat type of democratic action.

&gt; But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the existing political process in Michigan in a manner that burdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 election by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art.I, §26, which provides in relevant part that Michigans public universities shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin inthe operation of public employment, public education, orpublic contracting.

I fail to follow Sotomayor's logic.  I'd appreciate it if someone could explain it to me.  Sotomayor enumerates a list of democratic actions the people of Michigan could take to change affirmative action in the state of Michigan.  She is fine with those actions but not OK with the public changing the Michigan Constitution by popular vote.  How is that not democratic?  Why are those voters not ""free to pursue"" that action?

&gt; A student seeking to have her family's alumni connections considered in her application to one of Michigan's esteemed public universities could do one of four things to have the school adopt a legacy-conscious admissions policy: she could lobby the admissions committee, she could petition the leadership of the university, she could seek to influence the school's governing board, or, as a measure of last resort, she could initiate a statewide campaign to alter the state's constitution. The same cannot be said for a black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally permissible race-conscious admissions policy. That student could do only one thing to effect change: she could attempt to amend the Michigan Constitutiona lengthy, expensive, and arduous processto repeal the consequences of Proposal 2. The existence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political change.

The general theory, therefore, is that it is not enacting laws by referendum (popular vote) that is undemocratic; rather, it is using the referendum process to *entrench* a particular policymaking it difficult for future generations of minorities to change itthat is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

Imagine, for example, that the voters of a particular state said to themselves, ""we can see the politics of our state are gradually changing with an influx of young immigrants.  We'd rather this not happen.""  In response, they begin to entrench many of their current policies by making it more difficult to change those policies through normal democratic processes.  For example, they pass a state constitutional amendment saying: for any laws affecting the use of the death penalty, the legislature must pass those laws by a super majority (60%) vote, rather than a simple majority.

Constitutional amendments can, for this very reason, be very pernicious; they can entrench particular policies, thus making it difficult for future generations to change them without engaging in the difficult and expensive process of amending the constitution in return.

Now, this is not inherently a bad thing, and is not normally a violation of the U.S. Constitution.  But the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was designed to prevent Southern States from using legal process to discriminate against minorities, called into question state constitutional amendments that seemed to place special burdens on minorities.

This opinion, however, wrote that possibility out of the Equal Protection jurisprudence.

It is worth noting that statistical research (I'll edit this comment to add a link when I find it) has shown that 4 out of every 5 state referenda enacting constitutional amendments that address minorities' rights *have a negative effect* on those rightse.g. they take rights away or place additional burdens on minorities.  Much scholarship has been devoted to the phenomenon of circumventing traditional political processes to enact discriminatory policies.

This line of reasoning only true if you assume people always vote for/enact laws that is to their benefit:  all white people are always against affirmative action and all minorities are always for it.  This is clearly not the case, in the US we have plenty of people who vote for what they believe is right and not necessarily for their direct benefit: we have people living in rich northern states, which receive less benefits than they pay in taxes wanting *more* government and poor southern states which receive a net tax benefit wanting *less* government.

White privilege, is a huge and sticky thing. How many non-whites do you think would have gotten into college in the 1950s and 70s? 

&gt; But, I had better grades, I had better scores, it should be a meritocracy, the best grades gets in.

Except of course you did, you went to the best schools, with the most funding and the best teachers. All of which conveniently cost a shit ton of money, which comes from wealthy affluent (typically white dominated) neighborhoods. 

To spin it around, would it be fair to put a under-funded standard public education against a private school with dedicated tutors in a contest? 

Of course not, as it isn't a fair comparison. Why then are minorities (typically) from poor rural or urban areas who often have to work in addition to going to school, forced to compete with private, gated super-wealthy communities who can afford to study all the time and have dedicated tutors for college entrance?

That, is the white privilege that is being guarded against by these programs, that Whites have had, and continue to, have a institutional power that benefits them, and not other races. 

It's based on the idea that the nation/society does better by having a healthy and equal standing for all races. (The whole idea goes to shit if ~~you think that we should have mostly whites in charge, so there's that~~ happen to be a racist)

Case in point: when the Univ of California system got rid of AA, the percentage of Asians went up dramatically, not whites. It's around 46% at a school like Berkeley now (the top school in the system) now that it's based on a meritocratic system.

Likewise, if you look at any of the Ivy League schools, the percentage of Asians matriculating has conveniently stood at around 17% for the last 25-30 years consistently. Coincidence?  I doubt it.

Many of these Asians are the kids of poor cab drivers, gas station owners, dry cleaners, etc. Yet they don't qualify under AA--why is that?

Students who are minorities may not. They argued that this was unfair because it strips a certain group (minorities) of their right to explain who they are while maintaining that right for less needy groups. 

The problem with this is that any interesting story you can tell about your minority status can necessarily be told without including the words ""I'm black"" or ""I'm hispanic"" or I'm white."" If you grew up poor and needy, and had to take care of three siblings while putting yourself through school, that's really interesting and says a lot about your character regardless of whether you're black or white. If you were discriminated against because of your race and had to overcome a system stacked against you, that's interesting regardless of whether you happened to be born this or that color. The only reason you would need to say the specific race you happen to be a part of is if you want the admissions people to be able to tick a box in their heads that says ""ok, we got enough of X group this year."" That is the most base form of racial discrimination, and it's a good thing that the Supreme Court permitted states to ban it. 

That being said, I know some extremely smart, empathetic people who have thought a lot about this issue and come out the other way. It's a hard question.

Imagine the year is 1965. The Civil Rights Act was *just* passed. The elite institutions like Ivy League are almost entirely white, and ""historically black colleges"" are still 99.9% black and their quality of education is horribly substandard. The nation isn't governed by the graduates of these low-end black colleges (which at the time were far worse than the cheapest, small-town community college you can imagine). It was literally not *possible* for most African-Americans to significantly change their circumstances even though legally no one could stop them from doing so.

Even if the elite institutions practice race-blind admissions, even if all preexisting racial attitudes could be magically erased, it would **still** have been almost impossible for a black high school student in America to achieve the grades and test scores needed to gain admission into a good school in competition with wealthy white students who have private tutors, attend top private schools in the country, etc. True, that's an economic disparity and not an inherently racial one - the economic disparity might still exist today *but back then there were no minorities with access to those opportunities* so it laid strictly along racial lines. Like the old saying goes ""It takes three generations to truly get out of poverty,"" and that was the literal truth for African-Americans in the 60's. 

This was the rationale for affirmative action when it was introduced, and at the time it was probably a good one. It was literally true that a black person had to work at least twice as hard as a white person to get just as far, so in the face of a society that was at its core still very racist, it forced institutions to take into account how much more difficult it was for non-white students to overcome the disadvantages placed upon them. Without it, white colleges would probably still be white and black colleges would still be black. You have to take this into account because from our perspective now, growing up and living in a *very* different society, it seems unnecessary.

Whether affirmative action is still necessary today is a very different question from whether or not it was ever necessary. Laws are very slow to change and the people on the Supreme Court for the most part can remember it very well, which is why it's taken them this long to rule on whether or not it's time to set affirmative action aside. However, I think the majority of the SCOTUS is right here in that it's no longer necessary at a federal level and states should be able to choose to end it if they wish. ","7_6"

The reason they went with this policy is that education has the strongest correlation to success. People with higher levels of education consistently have less drug problems, better family lives, better incomes, better retirements, health, happiness, you name it. The mechanics of that aren't fully fleshed out but from a statistics point of view, getting people educated is the most effective way to deal with social problems. 

The catch-22 is that we see that serious social problems are correlated with people not getting a good education and hispanic and black Americans consistently have lower higher education enrollment.

That doctrine looks something like this: A state passes a law which looks something like this: ""All housing laws regarding race must be passed by 2/3 majority, whereas all other housing laws can be passed by simple majority."" The logic underlying this doctrine is that states can't make it harder for certain minorities to pass laws which benefit them. This is a form of equal protection violation.

BAMN's argument, which J. Sotomayor agreed with, is that this is what Michigan's Constitutional Amendment did. Thus, when she talks about ""erecting selective barriers..."" she's talking about removing laws which benefit certain minorities from the political process. 

It's a really, really, really complicated doctrine and it's tough to explain it to anyone without a fairly extensive understanding of 14th Amendment law. So, sorry if I've been less than clear.

The thing is, it's difficult for those schools to be competitive and successful.  First, towns like Cairo are still subjected to racism; see Jay Nixon's response to the notion of flooding MO farmland to protect Cairo.

While schools get federal funding, their funding is based on property values.  So, if your town is already poor, the school isn't going to get as much money.  The only way around this, really, is to have dishonest administrators and school board, or to have someone in your district, say, put up a bunch of low-income housing (yes, really.)  That last has gotten my wife's school through the current budget crisis so far.  The little town I came from, when I was a kid, they collectively refused low-income housing, purely because racial discrimination wasn't allowed in government housing.  They'd have to let the nigras live there!  O noes!

And do the kids actually give a shit?  Do they have abusive/indifferent parents?  Do they just think there's no reason to go to school?  The standardized tests will probably reflect that.  The way the current clusterfuck works, if standardized testing shows that your students are doing poorly, your funding goes down.  If it goes down enough, or if you don't show enough improvement, the school could get shut down.  The Cairo schools would be closed if it weren't for the fact that there aren't any schools within 50 miles that are enough better to take them.

The most infuriating thing about basing it almost solely on property value is that property values are no guarantee that a district will perform.  Cairo doesn't meet the standards.  Know who else doesn't meet the standards?  Barrington High School, a school in one of the most affluent districts in Illinois.  Now, they're *way* higher, and truthfully there seems to be a pretty consistent property-value-to-ACT-score ratio, but Barrington, despite having an indoor pool and a football coach that makes state university-level pay, doesn't meet federal standards.  (Cairo, by contrast, has buildings that should, by rights, be condemned.)

And at these crappy districts, you end up with teachers that might be thick-skinned, but maybe not such great teachers.  But the thing is, how do you attract talent if you can't pay them?  There are only so many people who are altruistic enough to give up the money.  And of course, if you're that kid from the 'burbs who's decided to change the world, and you take a job at Cairo, they have severe behavior problems.

Affirmative action doesn't say that some people are worth more or less than others. It acknowledges that there are cultural inconsistencies in this country.

Let's put this into video game world for a bit. Let's say that for some reason rural and suburban areas couldn't play a video game as well as others. People in dense urban areas had clear advantages over them.

As such, those people in dense urban areas got to level 100 in 5 years of gameplay, and those in suburban &amp; rural areas were stuck at level 5. The game was based on PvP interaction - so the level 100s are able to easily dominate the level 5's. There's nothing the 5's can do, they can never beat a level 100. The math itself precludes that possibility.

After 5 years, some rules are switched around, eliminating the artificial advantages. But there's still a clear problem. While it's possible for the 5's to level, they're still lagging and being clearly dominated by less skilled, but just higher level players.

You wait a while and see if it's changed at all. After 2 more years, some level 5's were able to break free and get up to a level that's as high as those with the previous advantage. But the vast majority are still stuck around level 5-10. And the level 100's are still between 110 and 120.

-----------

So you change the rules a bit. Having a severely low level doesn't hinder you as much anymore. You get artificial advantages that give the disadvantaged players with the most natural skill the ability to quickly gain levels (hopefully then turning around and helping out their comrades that are still stuck).

Does this mean that you built a system that says those with the previous advantage are 'worse' or 'better' than those without? Or is it just inserting an artificial crutch for those who were previously artificially disadvantaged.

----------------

The analogy is pretty simple, but to spell it out... When slavery ended, blacks found themselves in abject poverty and in a climate of deeply entrenched racism. The white people simply had more money. They also had a purely cultural advantage of not being directly discriminated against for no other reason than racial biases. Whites in the US had an artificial advantage over blacks for several generations.

After slavery, Jim Crow laws imposed even more artificial disadvantages for another 100 years.

--------------

As for my personal feelings, I think basing anything on purely cultural or racial lines is absolute the wrong way to go. As a stop-gap the first answer is to give advantages to people based purely on wealth. If you exchange 'black' for 'poor', you still hit a huge demographic of black people, but your overall goal of helping those with monetary disadvantages is preserved. In fact, it's even better than it would be had you based it purely on race.

It's helping raise up children who's parents simply couldn't afford to live in districts with good schools, who simply couldn't afford to pay for tutoring, who couldn't afford to stay home and help their children with homework, who can't afford college education. This is your goal. Not helping blacks or putting whites at a disadvantage.

My family was rather poor. I took the PSAT's 2-3 times, and on one, just for grins &amp; giggles I put down that I was African American. You'd be shocked at the number of scholarships I was offered. If I had been black, I would have had my pick of schools and college would have been 100% paid for. Nothing came to me when I put 'white'. I got to apply for loans like the rest of the melanin deficient. Why is this? Why do this based on race? If the goal is to give an advantage to the disadvantaged, the do that.

----------------

For an overall, long-term solution however, I think the answer to the problem is not affirmative action. Like many other issues, I see the answer in education.

We need to fundamentally change the way we educate our children. And we need to accept that society is simply better off with a more educated population, and provide college education to all high school graduates. And, much like our migration policies, have a set number of paid-for degrees based on the current regional needs (aka publicly-provided medical Doctor education where doctors are needed, publicly-provided welder education where welders are needed, etc).

This would allow for the wealthy to keep giving their children the advantages that wealth allows for, but also removes that financial barrier from the minds of the poor.

To further eliminate cultural biases, I'd also like to figure out a way that your name &amp; demographics don't have to be (or can't be) part of your resume or application for employment or college. Studies show that name biases run very deep in our culture - it's just another unfair burden that people shouldn't have to bear.","12_2"

If you have to work harder to achieve the same goal as someone equal to you, it is not putting disadvantages on a better person or trying to compensate for someone's personal deficiencies, it's compensating for unequal conditions that disadvantaged someone.

In the case of school acceptance: It may appear you are helping a lesser candidate, but they are trying to reward people who may show a similar level of merit in spite of coming from a lesser social situation.

Affirmative action as it operates today (post Gratz, post Grutter, post Fisher) requires that college's examine the whole applicant, beyond race. So, being poor and overcoming that to make good grades, do interesting extracurriculars, work a job, etc., supports your application. All of these things are balanced against each other to form a balanced class. I think your statement is based on a misunderstanding of the way affirmative action operates in college admissions. In effect, it likely would not harm you in any measurable way.

Sorry, but if there were a college club for all whites, that would be considered racist.  Just like how many whites view black only clubs to be racist.

BUT I do agree with her that it is also silly to give people a bump because they are legacies.

That being said...  I think that when you apply for college, you should be given an ID number online from an agency used by all colleges.  Your transcript should not have your name, but this ID number after you get it.  You are not Josh.  You are not Tyrone.  You are not Phuk.  You are not Rishnad.  You are 123456789.  The what race are you should also be taken off of the application.  There you go.  No college can ever discriminate against you for what you are ever again.  They have no way of knowing if you are a white male.  After you are accepted, they can have all of your personal information that identifies you.","16"

There is a reason around 70% of Asians and Jews voted for Obama; despite all the things that ""should"" make Asians and Jews Republicans, many are still really wary about racism and persecution (and we acknowledge science). 


At the same time, I think most Asians are against racial affirmative action. As an Asian, it scares me when people argue that our schools should reflect the population because Asians are by far the most over-represented race in schools. In CA and Michigan, when racial affirmative action was banned, the White % stayed the same or decreased. The Asian % increased. As the only over-represented group in CA schools, racial affirmative action MUST decrease the % of Asians (BTW, the low income % of students increased drastically compared to other top schools since banning racial preferences). Saying that racial affirmative action would not really hurt Asians because we are over-represented is like saying that making all sports teams reflect the general population would not be detrimental to blacks because they are over-represented. For all of Sotomayor's talk about confronting the ""stark reality of race,"" I noticed that she did not mention Asians, the only racial group who would see their admittance to schools decrease. 


I already support socioeconomic affirmative action because I have been convinced that money is highly correlated with the metrics used in school admissions. If you want Asians to support racial affirmative action, a good first step would be to acknowledge that it will hurt them. I can understand why a black, latino, white, or asian person from the ghetto needs affirmative action. I cannot understand why my black neighbor taking the same test prep courses I am needs it. If racial diversity, in and of itself, is the value to be gained, racial affirmative action should be applied to all university groups, including sports. If the only value Asians gain from racial affirmative action is increased exposure to Blacks and Latinos, I'm sure Blacks and Whites on the bball team would benefit from being teammates with a few Asians.

Right now we have affirmative action, race quotas, gender quotas, a very skewed ratio of scholarship opportunities for minorities in general, community programs that aren't found in rural and suburban ""white"" America, decades of attention from psychologists, sociologists, pubic officials, educators, etc.; we have race-specific advocacy groups, race-specific television channels, race-specific magazines...

We put more police in the ghettos to confront the crime there and the police -- many of whom are now non-white themselves -- are called racist. We take them away, and suddenly the city is accused of abandoning the ghetto to crime. Universities lower their standards to give minorities (except non-white Asians, who seem to do a great job on their own) a greater chance of acceptance. Companies and government agencies spend valuable time and money paying people to attend inane racial sensitivity meetings which ultimately achieve nothing.

Race as a concept is holding everyone back from cultural progress, unification and stability, because as long as it's discussed as something legitimate it will deflect any attempt at achieving real solutions. As long as race is something with which people identify, people will associate others by race. And, as long as value is placed in one's race in effort to counter racial discrimination (i.e., pride vs. belittlement), then negative cultural behaviors will continue to be defended as valuable and as such people will continue to associate those behaviors with particular racial groups (hip-hop culture, tackiness, misogyny, ignorance, violence, etc.).

The reason this is seemingly so hard for large sections of black America to overcome lies in the historical bases of the majority and minority cultures. To adopt a culture which functions and produces the same effects as the majority culture, the immediate conclusion is that the minority culture has to adopt the majority culture's values and practices. These are generally European in origin. Europe appears to be doing pretty well for itself compared to much of the world. It becomes, however, another reminder of falling behind, of subjugation, of the feeling of inadequacy. Africa offers few historical and current cultural attributes to assume if the goal is to join the majority culture (let's face it, much of Africa is a shit hole, like the worst ghettos of America but without a police force). It's the feeling of not being good enough.

What everyone fails to recognize is that most Europeans who immigrated here were of lower classes, had dissimilar backgrounds and cultural attributes reflective of much of Europe even today. But, through assimilation and exchange, we now have the EU and that 'devil' and ineptly-named ""white America"" -- dissimilar people who may now coordinate activities, build stability and wealth, maintain higher standards of living and occasionally provide assistance to the rest of the world who has yet to figure enough of it out to achieve the same. Nobody has an authentic cultural identity anymore. Abandoning the desire to retain a dysfunctional one is the first step to overcoming history.

If race is independently meaningful, then it is an indicator itself and black people are inherently incapable of high-functioning societies. History and present global examples here and abroad, generalized, would be the evidence for this. Obviously, race isn't meaningful, as black people have demonstrated they are capable of anything and many white people act like monkeys.

If wealth is independently meaningful, then it is an indicator in itself and poor people are inherently incapable of participating in high-functioning societies. Again, obviously many poor people contribute immensely to the continued progression of knowledge and the enrichment of culture, while many wealthy people contribute nothing, so this isn't true per this discussion either.

Culture -- what a people consider meaningful and desirable, that which bonds them -- and its products creating both coordinated and independent actions of inspired individuals sharing at least some important cultural values and practices are the true indicators, for without such positive attributes nothing of value is produced or maintained regardless of race, gender or wealth; and, with such positive attributes creativity, discovery and stability abound regardless of race, gender or wealth. Indeed, it often leads to economically elevated egalitarianism within social institutions where some degree of assimilation is necessary -- like the military, or a field in the sciences, or among relatively homogenous populations (e.g., Scandinavian countries).

**tl;dr:** This is a good thing for everyone in a deep and meaningful way.

&gt; As a result of §26, there are now two very different processes through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to influence the admissions policies of the States universities: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a University of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicants legacy status by meeting individually with members of the Board of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining with other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting for and supporting Board candidates who share her position. The same options are available to a citizen who wants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider athleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considers race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the citizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of amending the State Constitution.

OK, makes sense.  Those who argued against *race-sensitive admissions* went through *the daunting task of amending the State Constitution* so undoing that would require the same effort.

&gt; Our precedents do not permit political restructurings that create one process for racial minorities and a separate, less burdensome process for everyone else. This Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not tolerate a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes insuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.

Here is where her logic unravels: she is making the explicit claim of *persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies* are *all* members of a minority.  Plenty of white people in Michigan are for affirmative action and the Michigan constitution's ban applies to them as well.  No matter who you are, if you want Universities in Michigan to discriminate in favor of minorities, you have to change the Michigan constitution first.","46"

We show massive gross income but also carry massive expenses in land, machinery, etc. Most all assistance calculates financial need based upon gross income.

Coming from the guy that thinks laws forcing equal results by restricting things from select groups is equality, this statement is fucking hilarious. Why dont you learn what the word equality means, then look at your stance and realize you're answer to oppression is more oppression but against those you deem guilty.

I agree with you except for the part where you said arbitrarily decide. It's not arbitrary; they are rewarding their voters.

Blacks vote Democrat at a very high rate so of course they get the biggest bump. Hispanics vote Democrat but not as strongly so they get a bump but not as big. Asians don't reliably bite Democrat at a high rate so screw them.

This isn't arbitrary.

&gt;They will completely ignore if you came from a poor immigrant family from Southeast Asia or other factors. No, racist gets to decide to raise or lower your standards or raise or lower you scholarships based on your race alone.

If 10,000 fathers go to jail, it is both the state's fault **and** the father's themselves. We have to fix both imo. So the question is: how do we address the fathers to stay in their lives?


&gt; They absolutely do. Without our father figures and absent parents, gangs seem very appealing. You have people who look out for you, buy you meals, gives you drugs. They are a poison to black communities, but they stick like a cancer. They don't start you off killing immediately. It's literally an apprenticeship. It starts off with small things like ""look out while I sell this"", to ""give this to that guy and get the money"" to ""stand here and sell this entire bag"".... it's a slippery slope and you are doing better financially than the people who stuck with school.... It's very attractive to kids.


Yeah I agree man. We really need to decriminalize drugs to an extent.","3_1_1_1_1_1_2"

  The poor white kid gets a scolding when caught skipping class.  The poor black kid gets suspended.  

The poor white kid gets a warning when trespassing, the poor black kid gets arrested and expelled.

Next time both kids are found with pot, the white kid gets a slap on the wrist as a first time offender and after community service can have it expunged from his record.  The black kid get the book thrown at him because he has a record of priors and is a 'troublemaker'  

So despite them both doing the exact same illegal activities, the leniency towards one completely changes their ability to succeed in life.  The white kid can go on to make something of himself, and the black kid has numerous roads to success cut off (schools, military, gov. jobs, etc.) because of his criminal record...

I agree. But what percentage of black men are in prison due to discriminatory policies? The drug war is horrible though. Marijuana and maybe even hard drugs need to be decriminalized. That being said, you should still go to jail if you're selling heroin to minors.

&gt; There is also a bigger incentive in the ghetto to deal drugs, because the lack of infrastructure and investment makes it much harder to get hired in legitimate work. The schools tend to be a lot worse (kids having emotional problems is a big issue), so kids don't graduate qualified for good jobs. Selling drugs pays very well.

True. But why is the drug culture so adamant in these communities? The drug war is definitely part of it. But do you think any of it has to do with internal culture?

&gt; Now, once you've been in prison, it's EXTREMELY hard to get a good job. No place wants to hire you. So, back to criminal activities.

&gt; In less than thirty years, the U.S penal population exploded from around 300,000 to more than 2 million, with drug convictions
accounting for the majority of the increase. The United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world, dwarfing the rates of nearly every developed country, even surpassing those in highly repressive regimes like Russia, China, and Iran. In Germany, 93
people are in prison for every 100,000 adults and children. In the United States, the rate is roughly eight times that, or 750 per 100,000.  

&gt; The racial dimension of mass incarceration is its most striking feature. No other country in the world imprisons so many of its racial or ethnic minorities. The United States imprisons a
larger percentage of its black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid. In Washington, D.C., our nations capitol, it is estimated that three out of four young black men (and nearly all those in the poorest neighborhoods) can expect to serve time in prison.9 Similar rates of incarceration can be found in black communities across America.

&gt; These stark racial disparities cannot be explained by rates of drug crime. Studies show that people of all colors use and sell illegal drugs at remarkably similar rates.10 If there are significant differences in the surveys to be found, they frequently suggest that whites, particularly white youth, are more likely to engage in drug crime than people of color.11 That is not what one would guess, however, when entering our nations prisons and jails, which are
overflowing with black and brown drug offenders. In some states, black men have been admitted to prison on drug charges at rates twenty to fifty times greater than those of white men. And in major cities wracked by the drug war, as many as 80 percent of young African American men now have criminal records and are thus subject to legalized discrimination for the rest of their lives. These young men are part of a growing undercaste, permanently locked up and locked out of mainstream society.

Drug culture is NOT more prevalent in black communities. You get ridiculous stuff like [this white woman who appeared on the Today Show today because she says marijauna makes her a better mom](http://www.today.com/parents/marijuana-moms-say-smoking-pot-makes-them-better-parents-t114510) while black men go to prison for the same shit. Unbelievable. 

I see you keep bringing up ""internal culture"" - to my ears, it sounds like you're saying ""maybe there's something inherent to these blacks, maybe they're responsible for what's happened to them."" This is bullshit. A group's culture exists in relation to the real-world circumstances surrounding the group. I see in another one of your comments that 'inner city' culture embraces fate and resents authority and rules. To which, duh. Of course they would resent authority when authority has had it out for black people from the birth of this nation. ","3_1_1_5_1_3"

&gt; I see you keep bringing up ""internal culture"" - to my ears, it sounds like you're saying ""maybe there's something inherent to these blacks, maybe they're responsible for what's happened to them."" This is bullshit. A group's culture exists in relation to the real-world circumstances surrounding the group. I see in another one of your comments that 'inner city' culture embraces fate and resents authority and rules. To which, duh. Of course they would resent authority when authority has had it out for black people from the birth of this nation.

No...I am saying that **a part** of the crisis for black people has to do with their internal culture. They aren't fully responsible for what happened to them, but they are partially responsible. However, outside factors like the drug war, racism, and our prison complex are bigger factors for the plight of black people. My only point is that internal culture does play a part to an extent.","3_1_1_5_1_3_1"

I'm genuinely unsure of what you're alluding to. Wealthy folks tend to spend more on drugs, and poor folks have more reasons to seek out drugs as a means of escape. So there's the socioeconomic aspect, but I'm not seeing a ""culture"" aspect.","3_1_1_5_1_4"

Socioeconomic factors create classes which in turn develop their own culture. Socio-economic factors and cultural factors aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, often times they are intertwined. There have been multiple studies on lower class inner city culture. A brief description:


* getting into and staying out of trouble ...

* toughness (masculinity, endurance, strength ... are all highly valued) ...
* smartness (skill at outsmarting the other guy; 'street sense' rather than high IQ) ...

* excitement (the constant search for thrills, as opposed to just 'hanging around') ...

* fate (the view that most things that happen to people are beyond their control, and nothing can be done about them) ... and

* autonomy (resentment of authority and rules).","3_1_1_5_1_4_1"

http://www.slate.com/blogs/schooled/2016/06/17/the_upper_west_side_is_new_york_s_latest_school_integration_battleground.html

New York City has an integration problem. This is nothing new, of course; the supposedly most diverse city in the world has long had some of the most segregated schools in the country, and thats saying something.

In recent months, the citys battle over school segregation has played out in a few specific schools in some of the its fastest-gentrifying (or already gentrified-to-saturation-point) neighborhoods: Nikole Hannah-Jones chronicled the Brooklyn version of the saga in her much-discussed New York Times Magazine piece last weekend, Choosing a School for My Daughter in a Segregated City, about her decision to send her black daughter to a mostly minority school, only to have that school rezoned to include an affluent, predominantly white population.

The Upper West Side is another place where the rights of rich parents are being pitted against the reality of the neighborhoods demographics. The current battleground is the sought-after P.S. 452 on West 77th Street, a stones throw from the Museum of Natural History.

Like so many public schools in New York City, P.S. 452 has a lopsided enrollment, with a population thats three-quarters white and Asian, with only 13 percent of kids qualifying for free lunch, in a district thats 43 percent white and Asian and 48 percent low-income, according to a Chalkbeat story on the brewing controversy.

P.S. 452, which opened in 2010 to relieve overcrowding in other nearby sought-after schools, quickly became overcrowded itself. And so the city proposed moving the school, which currently shares a building with two other schools, 16 blocks south, to a site with more space that happens to be just adjacent to large housing projects. In one swoop, the city could solve the schools capacity problem while improving its diversity.

But of course, in an as-if-scripted repetition of the integration fights that have gone down since the birth of busing, many current P.S. 452 parents are up in arms against the proposal. After all, didnt they buy their expensive Upper West Side domiciles precisely for the right to attend this fabulously high-performing school? That, at least, is the argument getting the most airtime.

Bill de Blasio, the great white hope of progressivism when he was electedthe guy whos married to a black woman, after allhas stumbled when it comes to integrating schools, on the Upper West Side and elsewhere. From the Chalkbeat story:

&gt;The mayor has expressed support for school diversity, but he also has said the city must respect parents real-estate investments (a statement that at least one P.S. 452 parent repeated this week), while Chancellor Carmen Fariña has warned against **forcing integration down peoples throats.**

Fariñas line about forcing integration down peoples throats is almost laughable, for what else is the whole history of integration in this country but one of force-feeding, often in the form of landmark Supreme Court decisions?

I'm going to give you a heads-up-- people send their children to charter schools not because they enjoy school choice, but because they feel like they have no choice since the public schools are often dramatically poorly run. Reforming the American public school system to provide well and equally for all students would eliminate the need for charter schools.

- Charter schools aren't necessarily good, just frequently ""better."" There are many instances where the performances' of charter schools are worse, since the focus is frequently on the collection of money rather than education. ((Funding via?) Standardized tests seem to take priority of education in public schools.)

- Under the current system, there's an uneven distribution of quality private and charter schools between poor and rich communities. 

- Truely poor students won't necessarily have the option to travel far for for a school. 

&gt;One objection to this is that it will hurt certain schools if the parents remove them. I don't understand that objection because why should we reward poorly managed schools? If everyone wants to send their kids to a different school then that one should have the resources to expand.

You're not rewarding poorly run schools, since public schools are not for-profit entities (unless someone is embezzling). The decrease in funding results in a decrease in services for the remaining students, who are locked there. 

&gt;Another objection is that private schools should not receive public money. I find that argument bad because we don't restrict welfare recipients from donating to churches, we don't prevent food stamp recipients from donating to church food banks. We allow churches to collect donations tax free. We also spend millions to pay churches to resettle refugees.

Feels like I'm reading a transcription of white noise. I have no idea what the logical connection is here. 

Welfare recipients can't donate their food stamps and churches collecting donations tax-free falls under the separation of church and state. They also have restrictions around how involved they can be in politics. ","3_2_1_1_1_1_2"

What are the motivations for a school, who has a captured audience of students, to reform? The easiest way to motivate reform is for parents to be given options. Competition and choice are the easiest and most well proven methods we have to force improvement and efficiency. 

*Just to add, safety is another frequent reason parents cite for sending their kids to charter schools. Allowing a school option that has the choice to not allow violent or disruptive students is a good thing. Having one chronically misbehaving child can ruin the prospects for an entire class.

Improving the quality of the teachers can have a huge impact. Poorer schools tend to be saddled with a lot of teachers who are very inexperienced. Maybe there needs to be a better way for new teachers to accumulate experience.

Charter schools in the aggregate perform no better than public schools so I don't think they're the solution. Students there are also at risk of being ""captured"" in situations where the choice is two functionally identical schools.

Education policy based on evidence and carried out by skilled teachers is a more direct solution than competition. In the case of ""rewards"" based competition, the focus becomes money and edging out competitors, and there are too many ways to do this that don't involve improving educational outcomes or options. 

&gt;Just to add, safety is another frequent reason parents cite for sending their kids to charter schools.

Your second point makes sense but right now the public schools are not up to state standards for education. You can't excuse that when it concerns public schools and then use it as an excuse against private. 

Many private schools have accreditation, it's a rigorous process. What I believe is that parents, in general are more concerned about the well being of their students than any government agency. I trust parents to make choices for their children more than I do politicians and bureaucrats. Many people don't trust parents, they think others know better. 

Why can't the solution to discrimination against LGBT students be for organizations to open new schools that don't discriminate?

No. My point is that BOTH are predictors of academic achievement. Material resources probably more so. The whole point of this discussion is that you blamed it 100% on material resources and outside factors. So do you stand by that statement? Or does culture play a part. ","3_2_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1"

You sure? Correlation and causation aren't the same thing. I don't deny the correlation, but do you think single parenthood is the cause? Or that single parenthood and troubled kids share a root cause?

Furthermore, what are you gonna do about broken homes? I'm pretty sure that being in a single parent household is better than being in the foster care system, so you're sure as fuck not gonna propose taking the kids away. And a broken house that has two begrudging parents under the same roof is still a broken house, but instead of a one-n-done upset, it's an ongoing upset. Worseyet would be government mandated shotgun weddings... I shudder at the thought. And that's before we get to the fact that you have to totally shit on freedoms to enforce any of these.

So, what is there to do? I see no way to force two-parent households that isn't *both* harmful *and* unjust. Maybe I'm being uncreative... but what is there to do?

In my mind, we should try to make our society better at catering to the needs of single parents. You might call that encouragement, but I'd argue that it's likely not simply the fact that there's just one parent; it's likely the additional socioeconomic burden of being a single parent *combined with* the existing factors in the areas that single parenthood spikes.

If you look at Bakke v UC Davis, I'd actually side with Davis. The black person who got the seat may have been academically behind, but he would have probably practiced medicine from the area he lived in - it being the late '70s and all. This would translate into better outcomes for residents coming off of segregation a decade before. Mistrust and anger on both sides. 

But diversity for diversity sake isn't the way to go. Admissions keeps tight lipped on criteria - like what REALLY goes into your credit score. Hopefully they find candidates who do stuff they 'don't have to do'. Like more than a full transcript and a couple of AP classes. Like a job or volunteer work unprompted by their high school.

**edited** to add: if affirmative action should exist, it should center around socioeconomics rather than skin color. you can't go around advocating racial equality but endorse a legislation grounded in racism. policies like affirmative action in its current form that are aimed at bridging the racial divide in fact counterintuitively broadens that divide by fostering resentment in the disadvantaged party towards the benefiting party. the simplest solution is to remove race from the equation and strive for equality, period. because guess what? there ARE poor white and asian people as well as wealthy black and hispanic people, and the former are getting fucked over as it stands.

it's less about that (a personal insult) and more about trying to get more and more people who are minorities into the middle class and upper class workforce.  

Yeah, so some Jesus Martinez doesn't need to compete with middle class kids.  The understanding is that maybe he is a 2nd generation American, potentially living in poverty.  Getting him to college is a priority, so that we can get him to Grad School, and potentially have him serve his country, his people, or his language, in the middle class.  This incentivizes more and more to college.  

It's not about personal slights to you, because you're Hispanic.  It's about statistics and trying to make them better for the entirety of our culture, economy, and society.  

For instance, Black police might be more secure in their understanding of a black neighborhood dynamic, and get more out of witnesses who might have a distrust of a white/Hispanic police.  The same goes for a Hispanic mailman in a Latino neighborhood.  People might feel more comfortable asking questions in Spanish, and certainly feel like he/she isn't going to jump to legal status.  

These aren't bad things, this is how the USA kinda has worked for the last 150 years.  Many of the huge influx of immigrants that once were prejudiced against, are now completely integrated, so they are thought of as ""White"" rather than ""German"" or ""Irish"" or ""Armenian"", Americans.  

Affirmative Action has a net positive effect on society, and boiling it down to ""It's racist"" is exactly what nefarious and racist groups need to get rid of it in society.  The notion that there are people that are being passed over for unqualified people is cherry picking a part of the system that has to work in order to bring those people to the fore.  It has proven gains. 

It's certainly better than the alternative, where there is no AA, and virtually no hope for people from poverty who are very smart, but lack decent education to climb the ladder. 

And let's be honest, with property taxes tied to school funding, which is the majority of the US, there are statistically lower test scores from people in very poor neighborhoods.  The schools are simply not as good.  It isn't about the one, it is better for society as a whole to get those people who are struggling to get out, *out*. ","7_1_2"

Dude, you can look at drop-out rates, success rates, truancy rates, or any rate of measurement for this and see that White kids from these areas probably try harder, or at least stick it out until the end.

When the DOE/OCR released the 'Dear Colleague' letter, the official stance was that it was being put into place to ensure that the existing rules were being applied fairly and that all students were being treated fairly and being given an equal opportunity to excel.  Without getting into crazy legalese, the DOE created a [Chevron defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.) for universities, which legally means, if you're doing everything right, you have nothing to hide, and you need not worry abut potential repercussions.  The progressive left *loved* the DC letter and continues to fight for it to this day. 

How is this really that different? If a school's AA policies are being applied fairly and justly, thus giving every student an equal opportunity to excel, there's nothing to be sued over - there's nothing to worry about.  And keep in mind that these findings will not be unilaterally decided by either the administration or the school - thats the 'sue' part.

It turns out that ""doing everything right"" means signing over total power to people who make a living complaining about gender issues. Seems like a bit of a moral hazard to give essentially unlimited power to people who believe that every male is a potential rapist, and people who have stated on record that being falsely accused of rape is a ""good learning experience"" for a man. The universities are forced to do allow this under penalty of losing funding, and now on the other side, they're getting sued out the ass because the students they've been expelling were essentially given show trials with no due process. The universities are very much caught between a rock and a hard place, and in the meantime, the seeds that were sown when they invited in these gender advocates have blossomed into full-blown bureaucracies. It turns out that when your entire profession is to seek out new issues to complain about, you get pretty good at finding issues that desperately need your attention... and probably also your buddy from your old gender studies program needs to get brought on as well to work on it. 

This is a little more cut and dried. It should be trivial to remove race entirely from the equation. Everything that we use race as a proxy for- single parent households, coming from a bad zip code, low annual income, etc, can very easily be included on an application. Turns out all of that information is already required when you fill out the FAFSA (the federal college aid application) and it's much more accurate when you can directly account for it rather than making sweeping assumptions based on race. Of course, there will be plenty of race advocates that will screech to no end if we actually moved to needs-conscious admissions rather than race-conscious admissions. But whatever. Let the universities pin it on Trump. ","23_1"

The rest of them are all good enough, but not great. Those ""rest"" that are all qualified, but not exceptionally qualified, are the ones where affirmative action may help or hurt. But they are all kind of ""on the bubble"" of getting in or not getting in anyway. 

Interesting side-note: I do alumni interviews for prospective students for my almamatter. The alumni interviews break out to students who fall into one of two categories: extremely qualified, and the university wants to get their buy-in and interest, or ""on the bubble might not make it in"" students, where the university is looking for something that makes that student special. 

I can always tell who the overqualified ones are - even though I don't have access to their scores or anything else. I do find out - 2 months after the fact - if the student was admitted or waitlisted or rejected. 

Of the ""on the bubble"" students, those break into 2 categories as well. There are the casual / arrogant ones - who have 100% been white men (boys? usually 17 or 18) - they don't really have time to meet, that's not convenient for my schedule, come dressed in jeans and a tshirt - and there are the ones who come dressed up, ""yes maam"", thank you note after the fact - of which there is a more equal blend of ethnicities and genders. (And which also include white men - yeah yeah #notallmen) 

Almost none of the ""on the bubble"" kids get in. about 20% of them are waitlisted, and most they withdraw their application and pick up a sweet scholarship at a second-tier school. But the difference in attitude and entitlement is always amazing to me. Because these are kids who are 100% confident they are going to get in, but they really don't come close to the top tier students that I meet. ","41_1_1"

I think schools have an opportunity to be a great equalizer. It doesnt matter where you came from, if youre sharp, attentive and study hard you can make it in America. At least, thats the idea that colleges like to sell: your ticket into the middle class or above.

Except, that's essentially a lie. For example, at Harvard, more than half of the student body receives need-based income, and 20% pay nothing, because their families make under the US median income. Additionally, students who come from poverty make up about 20% of all US college students, and that number is rising, [as seen here.](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/05/22/a-rising-share-of-undergraduates-are-from-poor-families-especially-at-less-selective-colleges/) That means they are actually *overrepresented,* since the US poverty rate is 13%.

What's interesting about your argument is that it hinges on the idea that colleges are deliberately and maliciously discriminating against people. So, if your wish comes true and AA is eliminated, do you believe that these nefarious colleges will suddenly and arbitrarily decide to stop discriminating altogether, or do you want them to discriminate against minorities?","2_1_3_1"

Harvards legacy admissions are not typical throughout the country. Harvards practice of discriminating by race, are typical, due to affirmative action policies throughout the country. 

Again, legacy admissions arent really relevant to affirmative action discussions.","4_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

As for UNCs legacy admissions, they only consider legacy status for out-of-state applications and in 2019 only accounted for ~120 out of ~4300 admits. Definitely a different situation from Harvard.

There's also methodological problems with Prof. Arcidiocona's and Mr. Kahlenberg's statistical analyses that were submitted to support both the UNC and Harvard cases, which Prof. Card from UC Berkeley and Dr. Hoxby from Stanford elaborate on [here](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/diverse-education/files/expert_report_-_2017-12-15_dr._david_card_expert_report_updated_confid_desigs_redacted.pdf) and [here](https://admissionslawsuit.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/841/2019/01/Exhibit-023.pdf) that go into a lot more detail about just how the assertion that AA contributes to discrimination against Asian students is not clear from the actual evidence.","4_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1"

&gt;	All of Prof. Arcidiaconos models put too much weight on observable student characteristicsespecially test scores, grades, and racerelative to UNCs true admissions process. This is because Prof. Arcidiacono cannot observe many factors that UNC admissions staff can observe: factors that are too subjective, qualitative, or individual to be in the set of measured factors in the UNC admissions dataset. Since the models cannot put weight on unobservable factors, they overweight observable factors like test scores, grades, and race. As a result, test scores and grades play a larger role in a students estimated admissions probability than they play in his or her true admissions probability and true admissions outcomes.

Basically if you look at the objective measurables, there is significant weight given to URM applicants. The other subjective metrics are the same things that Harvard uses to negatively impact Asian applicants. 

Her argument is essentially there are other subjective factors at play that Dr Arcidiacono doesnt take into consideration, when the reality is those subjective factors are manipulated to artificially boost URM applicants at the expense of non-URM. 

Looking at the objective measurable figures, it is clear that URM applicants have a significantly elevated chance of admission.","4_1_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1"

Any Asian who had a parent go to a given school can claim legacy, but that is actually the smallest point advantage of the three. Dean's list means your parent's donated a large sum of money to the school (for Harvard it's something in the range if 1M for every 50 points below cutoff your kid is) and children of staff is self-explanatory. Despite Asian ""overrepresentation"" at elite schools, Asians are still less likely to be ultra-wealthy (generationally wealthy) and are hired at those schools as instructors at below average rates.

Also, very few people realize that the biggest legacy program in America is athletics. People give athletics a pass because they think that's how black kids get in, but black kids are only recruited for football and basketball programs. Those schools run dozens of programs for obscure prep school sports with very small pools of competition where you essentially have to have gone to an expensive private school to even be able to participate.

This works at the contract level as well, so if you pay a business that is owned by POC or a woman, then that counts. 

So a lot of contractors put their business in their wives names and make her the owner on the paperwork. This way the company can reap the rewards of being a DBE without contributing to the goals of greater inclusiveness. I have been working a job with several white and black laborers out of the union hall when the DBE woman-owned subcontractor will show up with a bunch of white dudes. One of the black workers said ""So that's what a minority worker looks like?""

In lightly populated or rural areas, some POC realize they cannot be fired because the contractor barely has enough people employed to make the DBE quota, so they don't bother even trying to do the job. This leads to white people hating the POC on the jobsite, which is the opposite of what anyone should want. On many jobs the POC that are hired are given the worst jobs possible, often working alone and away from the rest of the workers like holding a stop/slow sign. This provides a paycheck to people who otherwise might not have a job, but it definitely does not reduce racism. 

So if the goal is to provide equal employment, it does a bad job, if the goal is to reduce feelings if racial animosity it does the opposite. Also, there are still racists everywhere and they still act like racist cunts, they treat people differently based upon race and they mostly suffer no consequences.","5"

I am however saying that based on their endowment, one could reasonably expect a very low rate of return of approximately 1.5 billion (more in a good market or higher growth portfolio).  And that their annual tuition based upon the claimed tuition and student body comes to $1.2 billion.  
  
If however, you would like the rest of their budget breakdown:  
https://finance.harvard.edu/financial-overview  
  
If you want to go by that, 70% of their endowment spending is fixed, and must be spent on specific things, regardless of whether or not the university wants them.  And thus, can't really be counted as it's part of the budget and spending regardless.  You can also see that 39% of their spending was from endowments, so if you subtract that 70% which is mandatory you're left with a reduction in the annual budget of 1.365 billion.  
  
So really, what you're looking at is a budget of about $3.6 billion, out of which about $590 million is paid for through their endowment, $900 million through research grants, $880 million from tuition, $520 million from gifts, and $830 million from ""other"" (if you sum these it's a little high, but that's rounding errors for you).  
  
So what you have here, is tuition only being about 2/3 of what it should be, and you have the university making about a $300 million profit.  Combined with the above numbers that show tuition income is quite a bit lower than it should be, that would put the actual cost on average at 580 million or $25k/year.  
  
Additionally, they have the ability to use their remaining 30% of their endowment which fits into their general budget on anything.  Without going into all the financials, they could apply it all to tuition (this would come at the expense of other things currently getting that funding obviously).  Which the numbers above had that at $590 million, coincidentally their tuition was about $580 million.  
  
So even with a more detailed look at their finances, they could (barely) make the university tuition free for all students.","7_1_2_1_1_2_1_2_1"

But just like arguing that jail is an acceptable form of punishment does not require you to also hold the view that forcible confinement or imprisonment is okay for other reasons, endorsing the inherently racist policy of affirmative action does not require the proponent to support any other forms of racism.

No. Its actually not. Racism:
- a belief that race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race
 - prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

Essentially, racism involves the belief of superiority in one race over another. In the case of Affirmative Action, it doesnt take that position (IMO)  rather it acknowledges that all races are equal and thus is attempting to rectify past inequalities caused by legitimately racist institutions that harmed minorities.","7_3_2"

Affirmative action looks at all the evils of history done by some sort of institution, picks out a tiny subset of them simply because of some identifiable characteristic, and tries to ""right"" those particular problems by rewarding anyone with that characteristic, regardless of whether or to what degree they were actually connected to that harm... at the expense of anyone with the opposite characteristic, regardless of whether or to what degree they were related to the harm... all with little regard to how those original perceived sins actually measure up to the rest of the injustices they ignored*, and with no actual end goal or way to judge when this particular harm has been rectified.

I am not a huge fan of Affirmative Action but I do see it as the government trying to right some of it's own historical wrongs which I agree needs to be done somehow.   

I've always been against reparations as they've been described in the past because I don't see how money on it's own will fix generations of poverty.  I think people would just spend the money on stuff they need now (just like anyone would) and that would help in the short term but I don't see how it changes anything longterm.  Programs like Affirmative Action however do have the potential for pulling people out of generational poverty so I would be more supportive of that if it were sold as reparations.","7_4_1_1_1_1"

I don't care who ""deserves"" what. If parents want to pay extra so that their kid does better than average, that's a sum of money me and the rest of the taxpaying public don't have to put up.

Between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 students in the US academically qualify to get into an Ivy League school.  There are only enough seats however to fit about 0.67% of students each year (that's 1 in 150).  
  
A large part of getting in is based on luck.  
  
&gt;Who cares if their kid does better?  
  
You do because life is competitive.  There are limited spots for good schools, far fewer than there are students who can actually qualify based on academics.  Furthermore, there are far more qualified applicants for jobs than there are positions for those people.  Their kid getting an education and a job directly takes a potential job away from your kid.  So by them spending more to give their kid a better chance, your kid is getting a worse chance.  
  
When your kid gets a worse chance, because of what your neighbors did, it negates the effort you put into helping your kid and that is completely out of your control.  The only thing you can control, is spending more money of your own to balance that back out.  
  
Essentially, you and your neighbor are bidding on your kid success.  It's not about your kids effort, because we're talking about kids who academically qualify anyways.  You could actually save a whole lot of effort here by just skipping the middle man and letting universities allow students (or in your case, their parents) bid directly on tuition, and just give the slots to whoever bid the most.","7_5_2_1_1_1"

Always has been, always will be. Have a backup plan. 

&gt;You do because life is competitive.

Only if you're insistent upon being the best of the best. Doing fine but not number-one is still OK. My kid is still gonna get in somewhere and will have a good life. 

&gt; Furthermore, there are far more qualified applicants for jobs than there are positions for those people.

That depends on the industry. The unemployment rate is really low right now, so in general people are still getting jobs. 

&gt;So by them spending more to give their kid a better chance, your kid is getting a worse chance.

This is not a zero-sum game. The foremost goal is well-educated kids, not equality of opportunity across income level. You can't establish that without arbitrarily knocking down rich families' efforts to educate their kids, and that's just a waste of resources. Let them take the fast lane. There's enough room in college for all of us. 

&gt;When your kid gets a worse chance, because of what your neighbors did, it negates the effort you put into helping your kid

It so does not. This isn't a head-to-head competition. And we've already adjusted to the reality of competitive college admissions with a wide array of colleges to go to. Do you know how badly you have to do to not get into college at all? You basically have to not try.

&gt;You could actually save a whole lot of effort here by just skipping the middle man and letting universities allow students (or in your case, their parents) bid directly on tuition, and just give the slots to whoever bid the most.

But that doesn't weed out the bad students. Money doesn't guarantee academic success. Some kids are slackers, some are criminals, and some are just dumb. Throwing tuition money at them would be a waste.","7_5_2_1_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/sbpnz0/supreme_court_will_consider_challenge_to/","Aazadan","2022-01-25",1643088785,2,2,0,0,"&gt;Only if you're insistent upon being the best of the best.  
  
Nope.  If there's 100k jobs available, and 120k qualified, 20k are unemployed.  If that rises to 110k/150k, then 40k are unemployed.  Being the best of the best doesn't matter, because you're looking at a top x%.  Your kid is in direct competition with every other kid, to push that 1-x% below them.  Thus, you are by extension in direct competition with every other parent out there to push their kid down.  
  
    
&gt; This is not a zero-sum game.  
  
If it is not a zero sum game, and jobs are unlimited, then there is no benefit to giving them a leg up on the competition.  Your actions towards education directly contradict this viewpoint.  
  
&gt;Money doesn't guarantee academic success.  
  
The average high school GPA in the US is about 3.58 (I forget the exact number, I quoted it earlier).  In poor districts, it is about a 3.4.  In middle and upper class districts only it is around a 3.7 or 3.8, and in wealthy districts it is 3.9.  That is just public school, in private schools it goes up further.  
  
A large part of this is due to grade inflation which is near impossible to avoid (wealthier schools have more inflation, this is also true of universities), but some of it is due to other factors as well.  
  
However, since universities will already consider any good students regardless of GPA (this is part of what affirmative action corrects for), what you end up seeing is that money directly buys a better GPA.  
  
Also, I don't know how many Ivy League people you've worked with, but quite a few of them are pretty dumb.  They end up at the exact same jobs as everyone else.  They get interviews initially at higher frequencies, and promote easier due to networking however in terms of actual capability they're pretty much equal to others.  
  
Intelligence is largely a non factor.","7_5_2_1_1_1_1_1"

That's not how jobs work. The number of jobs in the economy is not static. And with unemployment pretty low right now, more people than ever have the chance to get on that bottom rung. 

&gt;If it is not a zero sum game, and jobs are unlimited, then there is no benefit to giving them a leg up on the competition.

The benefit is marginal, not binary. Nearly everyone is good enough to get into college and get a job. You don't need to be number one in your class to get a decent job and get a good life, and if a few extra people edge you out for your first choice, it's not the end of the world. You're still gonna end up somewhere you're qualified, which is the whole point.

&gt;but quite a few of them are pretty dumb. They end up at the exact same jobs as everyone else. They get interviews initially at higher frequencies, and promote easier due to networking however in terms of actual capability they're pretty much equal to others. 

So what you're saying is, college is a sham and doesn't actually educate anyone. That's a pretty big accusation to be leveling with nothing but anecdotal evidence to show for it, isn't it? 

Look, your average Ivy League graduate isn't competing for jobs with high school dropouts. They're competing with other people who went to good schools. Which proves what I was saying before: it's not the end of the world if you don't get into Harvard. You didn't get irreparably screwed by the system, you'll be fine. Go to Rice, or Tufts, or Drexel. You'll be right next to the Harvard graduates at your job.","7_5_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

We're not talking about any college though.  We're talking about one of the top ones, and the networking opportunity that provides.  If you weren't attempting to out compete everyone else, you wouldn't be pushing them for additional advantages for your kid.  
  
Any university can give an education, and give you sufficient knowledge to perform a job.  But, that's not what you're after for your kid because you don't want them to have just an education.

You can't fix that without having generations of people in professional positions that can mentor others.  And since people like to gravitate towards others like them, it means you need ample numbers of people that are typically disadvantaged in order to ultimately address it.  
  
This is also why universities like to focus on a students background.  Something no one really ever likes to talk about, is that these universities literally don't have space for every qualified student.  
  
https://www.ivycoach.com/2020-ivy-league-admissions-statistics/    
  
In 2020, Ivy Leagues admitted a combined 23,189 people.  That means we're looking at about 150,000 students in total that year.  But, in 2020 there were 20 million active college students.  That means less than the top 1% of students are able to take an available seat.  
  
Here's the kicker though, if we look purely at academic ability, grade inflation is a very real thing.  
https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2017/07/17/study-finds-notable-increase-grades-high-schools-nationally  
  
The average GPA in high school is 3.38, the average in schools in wealthier neighborhoods is a 3.9.  About 45% of students nationwide graduate with above a 3.7, with most of what gets brought down being kids in poorer schools who have the same level of ability but poor living situations.  
  
Basically, there are so many people who can qualify academically, that functionally at a bare minimum 1/3 of high school students meet the academic requirements to get into an Ivy League.  1 in 3, and trending near 1 in 2 all while only 1 in 149 can actually be accepted.  
  
So at that point, the question becomes one of how you balance this out?  Due to where/how grades cap out, there is no ability to further differentiate students academically, and even if you could, it probably wouldn't matter because of grade inflation making it impossible to actually distinguish between students based on their grades after a certain point.  
  
So, at that point your options are either a purely random lottery, or you try and accept based upon a diversity in experience/background in order to create more opportunity for everyone over time.","7_5_4_1"

Instead, it has to do with access to the infrastructure and institutions that enable people to see professional and financial success.  When a minority community lacks infrastructure such as good shipping routes for example, because the roads were intentionally designed back in the 60's to be too small for semi's or train tracks can't be run to distribution centers in that area, it impacts how much a region can economically develop.  
  
That in turn creates poorer residents, which in turn means those residents have less access to good education, due to school funding coming from local tax bases, which in turn greatly reduces the opportunity for people living in that region.  
  
Since most of these communities are minority communities, that is why it's considered to be systemic racism.  Another example that was brought up in this thread was legacy admissions for the children of athletes.  Since many sports like golf, water polo, and so on have little competition and primarily pull from just a single demographic, it creates a policy that overwhelmingly favors white people.  
  
It's not overt racism, it is however still hurting races.  And those sorts of things aren't easy to change.  Either you remove legacy admissions from athletes or you get water polo teams in minority neighborhoods that have an annual income of $10,000 a year and no access to travel to facilities to actually practice/play.","7_5_4_1_1_1"

When your culture matches the culture of the questions, you're going to pick up on more context clues (particularly in reading/writing portions), and you're often times going to have teachers who better teach in a way your culture will be more receptive to due to shared language at home and at school.  
  
Here's an example from when I was 20 years old.  I had moved to San Diego and needed a new drivers license.  The DMV only had Spanish language driving tests that day for some reason I don't remember, and there were no translators available at the moment.  
  
The test was largely symbolic with the instructions and a written question to go along with the image in Spanish .  Being familiar enough with how to drive, having driven in California a lot already and thus knowing the laws, as well as coming from the same culture as those who wrote the questions, the pictures could give more than enough context clues for me to ace the test.  
  
However, had I grown up in a different culture where I didn't get to travel a bunch, where I wasn't familiar with driving laws that were and weren't standard everywhere, to the point that I knew which laws were state only, I would have failed the test.  
  
For a specific example, I grew up in Nevada which at the time was an oddity in that it allowed for U-turns anywhere unless a sign specifically prohibited it.  If I had only been exposed to Nevada laws, that would be familiar to me and I would get that question wrong on the California test when it asked me that.  
  
This is also true of the right on red law, which at the time California did not have.  
  
It was only because I had the opportunity to see beyond the bias of my own perspective that I could correctly not only identify the question being asked, but correctly answer it.  Without that, I could have easily interpreted such a question as asking for example, what the correct way to perform a u turn was, based only on the symbols provided.","7_6_1_2"

Ability to learn and thrive in an academic situation. I propose we measure this by having students pass through multiple series of slowly increasing challenges, while checking and recording how well they keep up.

After enough time has passed we'll have a long history to judge that students abilities. If that's not enough, we can sometimes issues larger challenges. These would require the student to remember all sorts of different skills from past challenges at the same time, and measure how well they do this.

If we want, we can even include a record of things that student did outside of the challenges we give them, as this would show they have the energy and ambition to pursue their own goals.","7_6_3"

&gt;Affirmative action for income levels wouldn't do anything except arbitrarily accept more people of lower standing and less people of higher standing.

Maybe you misunderstood. Here's the scenario:

""Hm, you have a low test score, but you also have low income, so we'll let you in, regardless of your real intellect ""

""Hm, you have a high test score, but you also have high income, so we won't let you in, regardless of yiur real intellect.""

Depending on the point you want to consider as a cutoff (between 3.7 and 4.0) between 31% and 48% of high school students qualify for an Ivy League based on academics.  
  
The average high school GPA in the US is a 3.38 nationwide, and when restricted to only middle class and above school districts that jumps to a 3.56.  
  
A grade filter is already applied.  Affirmative Action works on people who are already qualifying academically, no one gets in without doing that.  But, at a certain point it becomes impossible to further distinguish between students based on academics, and at the point you hit that, you still have between 1/3 and 1/2 of all students qualified.  
  
So, at that point how to you differentiate based on ability?  Should you just pick at random?  That takes any personal effort out of the equation.  Should you base it non academic accomplishments?  That generally means students with families that have disposable time/income to support their students activities, thus wealthy families, this makes it about your parents rather than your drive, just like legacy admissions today.  
  
Do you instead try to diversify student backgrounds for those non academic activities?  A woman who is the lead singer in a folk metal band that has an after school job working as a farmer in Iowa is going to be a more unique background than the son of a banker in NYC, and so would see a better chance based on diversity.  That's what they do right now.","11_4_1_2"

Education is essentially a non factor because somewhere between 1 in 3 and 1 in 2 high school students in the US qualify for an Ivy League based on academics (seriously, the average GPA in the US is over 3.5 due to grade inflation).  There's such little difference between students on the higher end of the grade spectrum that there's no realistic way to better differentiate between them.  
  
As such, the next biggest thing these schools look at is a diversity in life experience so that the student body doesn't become an echo chamber all with the same perspective.

The REASON you want affirmative action is because minorities (and inner-city youth) tend to be at a disadvantage in school, so they need a bit of a helping hand in getting into good universities. The problem isn't university admissions, it's grade school. If you really want to make things better you would go after the grade school inadequecies. Then, if you *still* have affirmative action in place at the university level, you'll end up with a reversed problem: over representation of minorities (not that I imagine you'd have an issue with that).

You want an equality of outcome, but that means that the kids still have to go through a terrible grade school and all of the traumas and problems that stem from that. Some of us, on the other hand, want equality in opportunity, but that means that minorities will continue to suffer exactly as they currently are until we can actually fix grade schools. Your option means that the government has to be a little racist until you can fix absolutely everything which makes one group suffer and one group suffer slightly less, whereas my option means that we have to stop the government from being racist one bit at a time, and each bit makes everyone's lives better. My option takes longer than your option to reach the desired outcome, but it's more fair and equal than yours is. You basically want to punish people because they *aren't* a minority, and that just breeds more hate and racism.","16_1_2_1_1_1"

Being asked by your counselor what you plan to major in when you're a sophomore in *high school* is ridiculous. My counselors never discussed anything beyond a 4 year uni degree or *maybe* community college as a plan moving forward from HS. The other voice in the  room we had was the Army recruiter and there's plenty of reasons to be skeptical about military recruiters. I ended up going to college, having a shit  time due to poor planning and a shoddy understanding of what was going on, and then enlisted in a different branch. 

Kids are being told that the best (and sometimes only) way to succeed is to go take a boatload of loans, spend *another* 4 years of education, and then they can get a job that isn't minimum wage. The image that was painted to me was that if I didn't go to university, I'd end up poor and stupid. Trade school, apprenticeships, and even things like the local fire academy were not brought up for us. 

Honestly it was only after being booted from uni did I actually realize there were so many opportunities I could have done right out of high school besides a four year degree.","20_2_2"

I obviously wouldn't say someone who gets a PHD has a useless degree, but as you said, I'd imagine they get paid less overall now, and probably will be paying more for a degree as time goes on. Some degrees are sorta necessary, due to how strict they need to be for standards and such, although even that isn't perfect.

One major industry where college degrees are borderline useless is IT. We don't even glance at someone's unless they have some sort of work history. Even if that means they set up a homelab and just had personal projects, literally anything is better than *only* going to school.

The reason for this is for awhile now, I'd say anywhere from a third to half the people I've interviewed/met/worked with who *just* have a degree didn't learn much at all. I'm talking basic stuff, like simply moving files in console/terminal. It would be akin to someone graduating or getting certified for a mechanic, but not even understanding how to change oil still, the bare basic stuff. They'd have great GPA's, but functionally less knowledge than most *children* I know who simply dick around with that stuff because it's fun for them.

Another issue is that with education in IT, by the time you graduate, about half or more of the stuff you've learned is already outdated/changed, sometimes drastically. Combine that with the fact that IT effectively demands you to be self-driven and capable of learning on your own, and it doesn't take much to fall *very* behind, or simply not do enough to keep up with classes.

Even outside of IT, friend of mine graduated with a masters in a medical science. Dude busted his ass for ages, worked harder than I ever did working manual labor or IT. Despite that, I literally made more than him working agriculture/landscaping, which aren't exactly famous for printing money (although not the worst in some cases). 

I don't know how much he paid (or has in loans more like), but I'd be willing to bet *most* degrees now have steadily been raising in price, as you said. Not only that, but the average pay compensation has probably dropped like a rock after graduating as well. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if statistics showed half or more of people don't even get a job in their degree field for the first X amount of years after graduating or something.

I don't know, there will always be industries where you're at least guaranteed a decent wage/job (in due time) provided you bust your ass and get good grades. Stuff like being a doctor, or other industries will always pay more than others, and some will generally be pretty stable. That being said, I think overall, you're spot on.

I mean, especially considering as I said, I was making more (and still could be making more) working landscaping than more than half my friends were, 4 years after they graduated. Many of which *did* have jobs within their field, but so many jobs and degrees seem to have been devalued, at least in the aspect of how much pay, or how decent the jobs are.","20_3"

What does that have to do with anything? In any industry you're going to get paid more after 10 years, degree or not (unless you really don't achieve much). In this case, I'm still paid more than him, unfortunately.

I was simply pointing out that when it comes down to it, a degree isn't a guarantee for money, and in fact, many trades that don't require degrees can easily make more money than most degrees. Not saying degrees are outright bad, more so that it depends on the industry, and it's still a huge risk to spend that much money and not have any guarantee you'll even work in the same industry. Degrees *can* be good, but they're not always the best option, nor even a good one in some cases.","20_3_1_1"

Good. Roe was a federal overreach of a criminal matter best reserved to the states. The federal government was never granted any sort of power over the matter so the 10th amendment applies, which means it should purely be an issue under the purview of the state governments. States are self-governing entities, not subservient provinces created for the benefit of the Union level government. If a state finds the practice of abortion to be vehemently disgusting and against the morals of its people, then it should be left alone to regulate it as it sees fit. If the people of a different state somehow finds the practice to be morally tolerable, then they ought to be free to regulate themselves to their liking on the matter without imposing such diseased thinking using the powers of the federal government","22_1"

They followed a script basically from A to B and had constant guidance from their parents. Furthermore, they never had to work or ever had to struggle with anything.  Additionally, If they mess up there was always a cushy safety net to catch them. Yes, they are a strong student, but when you put them in a pool of other people in the same situation they are not actually as strong as when you compare them to the entire body.   


Option 2: Another kid who grew up in a broken home. Somehow navigated all of the pitfalls that involve being poor. Finding a stable place to live, having to work/hustle, while going to school and somehow managing to get good grades. This kid didn't score as well as the the first kid I described, but he is more or less +/- 10%.   


I view the second person as the stronger candidate. From my perspective this is a more rounded meritocracy than simply basing everything off GPA/SAT scores. Anyway, it's not really about leveling the playing field, it's more about factoring in a persons life into the decision making process.

In this midterm year, however, as progressive groups have mushroomed and grown more active, and as liberal billionaires such as Howard Schultz and Tom Steyer have begun to imagine themselves as political heroes and eye Presidential runs, the A.C.L.U., itself newly flush, has begun to move in step with the times.

This is literally fact people. The Supreme Court and what is ruled are easily found, as they are historical fact. Downvote all you want you will still be wrong. 

&gt;In cases in the 19th Century, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment does not bar state regulation of firearms.  For example, in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542, 553 (1875), the Court stated that the Second Amendment has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government, and in Presser v. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252, 265 (1886), the Court reiterated that the Second Amendment is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the National government, and not upon that of the States. Although most of the rights in the Bill of Rights have been selectively incorporated (PDF) into the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment and thus cannot be impaired by state governments, the Second Amendment has never been so incorporated. [UPDATE: In McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010), the Supreme Court addressed this issue, ruling that Second Amendment rights are applicable to states through the Fourteenth Amendment.]

It makes a distinction between a ""Militia"" and ""the people,"" with a Militia being an army and the people being common citizens. 

And there was never any debate about how our Founding Fathers felt about firearms. James Madison compared the US to European countries: 

&gt; Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of. Notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms. And it is not certain, that with this aid alone they would not be able to shake off their yokes. But were the people to possess the additional advantages of local governments chosen by themselves, who could collect the national will and direct the national force, and of officers appointed out of the militia, by these governments, and attached both to them and to the militia, it may be affirmed with the greatest assurance, that the throne of every tyranny in Europe would be speedily overturned in spite of the legions which surround it.

So you assume someone faced racial discrimination on the basis of their race. And your solution is to acknowledge and apologize for that assumed racial discrimination is to mete out further racial discrimination to someone you have assumed not to face racial discrimination. All on the basis of statistics. Does this really make any sense to you?

Yes. Does it suck? Yes. But it is compensatory. No one really pushes alternatives. I also don't assume group B hasn't dealt with discrimination, I'm making the assumption that is less, in aggregate.

We are dealing with hypotheticals and models here, and I think that is fair.

It is a proxy criteria. It gets the most data in the fewest questions. If you are going to model your student body, their cultural and economic circumstances, and their outcomes, race is the cheapest and easiest way to do this.

We can do better with the math we can do now, but I can understand why the would categorize people this way.","6_8_3_1_1_1_1_1"

I know that this isn't true 100% of the time, and there are many of black Americans who don't fit into this lower SE status category.

HOWEVER, I've personally witnessed this process completely backfire... students getting admitted to graduate school due to affirmative action and they just simply aren't able to keep up with the rigorous demands then drop out. 

I don't have a solution and don't know if the above reasons justify these policies or not.

Are they just job training factories, or are they institutions of higher learning and education? If the latter then it is more advantageous for the university, as well as for society as a whole, to encourage a more diverse student population, so that you can gather together many different cultural perspectives, ideas, and thoughts, so that throughout the universities' search for better technologies and research, you have a wide variety approaches to take, and will be better able to select ones that provide the greater amount of advantages to a greater portion of society.  

I really like Harvard's quote where they said: ""We're looking for people who are genuinely curious. Not just those who do well on exams but actually want to lean and have an integrative capacity."" This is the same approach that many HR people use when hiring people for a job. It is NOT just about your exam performance or standardized testing results. They look at volunteer work, sports involvement, leadership experiences, travelling, languages, etc. It is a WHOLE person approach that leads to success, and yes race is one of the many factors that does play a role in this process.  

And it is NEVER to say that ""Oh you are ""race type 1,"" which means you are ""inferior/superior,"" which means you automatically ""can/can't"" be accepted."" But whether you want to accept it or not, different races have different cultural perspectives, and while they are all equally important and valued, it is advantageous for universities, organizations, companies and society as a whole, to promote diversity and participation by ALL.","18"

There seems to be an idea that these universities are simultaneously machines which exist to provide privileged people access to an old boys club  to get ahead in the world, but care so much about liberal values so as to skew their admissions procedure. 

So, what do these universities actually want. They exist off donations and make a profit, so they want to make as large a profit as possible. The best way they have to do this is to choose people that they will be most successful in the long run. That makes their admissions decisions a lot more complicated than just picking students with the best grades. 

So, whatever system they have is likely to be some sort of statistical prediction based of all the available data they can legally ask for. First, they're going to give places to the 'legacy' students, because they're more likely to be successful and donate. There's going to be some bar they have to pass, but it's going to be lower than everyone else. Then they're going to look at grades and economic background, which is likely to be partially based on race and country of origin. For example, for graduate school students have to take the GRE exam, there's a cutoff score which is based on country of origin, since preparation for that exam is more difficult to come by in Europe than it is in the USA. For students from China the cutoff is really high, since they do more significant preparation and get higher scores than the US students. 

So, they're trying to look at everyone, and predict who will do the best in their upcoming degree if everyone applying had had exactly the same opportunities in life. Obviously that's a really difficult question to answer, and it's possible to have a discriminatory answer, but it's also possible for the answer to that question to depend on race, as a proxy for other factors and for it not to be discriminatory. 

It's also possible to take a really log view of the whole thing, since they're trying to predict who will be influential in the future, if the typical worldview starts skewing more towards equality,  maybe you want to increase your students numbers who have a particular background. After all, if the system is set up to favour white young men, which, for a long time it definitely was, then how are you going to change the system setup without bringing more minorities in, and seeing how well the system serves them. After all, most of the systems we design tend to be self perpetuating, as the people who get to decide and improve those systems are the people who went through them in the first place, and the improvements they make are things that they think were wrong, i.e. things that would have made it better for them.

So, he university has a system influenced by the people who were successful in that system, and they're trying to make a difficult prediction, using the data they have from applications, that will tell them who is going to be successful in the future, where the data they have about future success is skewed by the demographics of people who already were successful in the system, because that's all they have to compare to in the first place. It's an almost impossible problem, and given the large effect that the demographics or race or economic background or gender of the already successful people could have had on it there procedure, it seems reasonable that they might try and account for that. Whether the way they've done that is racist or not is why there's a trial, but it's not a cut and dry thing.

TD:LR Universities want to predict the future success of students applying now, and the long term data they have to base their decisions on is skewed towards what's best for rich white men. So including race as a factor in their decisions might be a sensible thing to do.","26"

[*Hunter v. Erickson*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_v._Erickson)- a city council prohibited any housing ordinances discriminating based on race. The Supreme Court struck it down as a violation of Equal Protection because it found that the city had racial discrimination issues in the past and that the ordinance was put in place essentially to shut minorities out of city council discussions about housing issues in Akron.

[*Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1*](http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/457/case.html)- Law put in place by Seattle School board saying that busing (letting students in one neighborhood attend another school for a different neighborhood) for *any* reason was not allowed. The Supreme Court also struck down this law, as it found the Seattle School District historically to have racial segregation issues and that desegregation was heavily reliant on busing. The Court established the **""political process"" test** for these situations: If a legal body (1) changes a law that ""inures primarily to the benefit of a minority"" by (2) placing the decisionmaking authority of that racially beneficial law at another level of government, it violates Equal Protection.

So that sets up the tests generally for violating Equal Protection. Here's the Michigan-specific background on how this most recent case came to the Supreme Court.

Michigan affirmative action cases: [*Grutter v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger) and [*Gratz v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger). Sometime in the early 1990s, The University of Michigan established racial factors of varying degrees in their schools. The undergraduate system awarded points toward the total required for admission for being a racial minority. The law school used race as a ""plus factor"" for balancing out law classes with diverse participants. Grutter and Gratz were students that applied to the law school and undergraduate college, respectively, of the University of Michigan. Both were denied admission, are white, and claimed their denials were due to racial discrimination, essentially being on the wronged side of affirmative action. Both cases made their way to the Supreme Court, and the Court ruled on them both at the same time.

The *Grutter* case (the plus factor, but not a quota) was ruled as a valid exercise of affirmative action and that it did not violate Equal Protection because it was not a quota and was not used invidiously against any race. The *Gratz* case (providing automatic points for being a minority) was seen as a violation of Equal Protection because it provided an automatic advantage for simply being a racial minority.

In response to those Michigan cases, Grutter (and many others) petitioned across the state of Michigan to take advantage of their state constitutional right to amend the constitution via popular referendum. They proposed that the Michigan constitution be amended to prohibit any affirmative action policies by state schools in admissions. The referendum passed 58% to 42%, and was added to the Michigan constitution. 

All this set the stage for the immediate case. Proponents of affirmative action argued that moving the ability to implement affirmative action programs violated the *Seattle School District* political process test as it moves the decisionmaking authority of a program that inures primarily to the benefit of a minority from the University of Michigan's Board of Directors to the Michigan constitution. This prevents minorities from even being a part of the conversation when it comes to laws that affect them the most. 

Opponents of the change argue that this is simply the political process at work. Democracy requires a majority opinion, and that opinion was heard in the form of a referendum to change the Michigan constitution. Additionally the ban prohibits all racially motivated factors from the admissions process, thus permitting a level playing field for everyone regardless of race.

The breakdown and outcome of the immediate case is as follows:

* 6 Justices voted that the affirmative action amendment, for various reasons, is valid. So the amendment stands, and for practical purposes, Michigan will remain a state that bans racial factors from admission to its public schools. 

* For legal purposes going forward, only three justices (Kennedy, Alito, and Roberts) felt that the political process test is a valid test, but that the facts of this case do not meet the standard professed in *Hunter* and *Seattle School District.* Essentially they say that the political process isn't rigged in this case, but it could be if the facts were different.

* Two justices (Scalia and Thomas) feel the political process test is improper for any set of facts and that *Hunter* and *Seattle School District* should be overruled. They state that democracy determines what is proper activity and what is not, and that so long as there is no intent to discriminate, the people in a particular area are allowed to relegate power to various levels of government at any time for any reason.

* The last justice that voted in favor of the amendment, Breyer, felt that the political process test simply did not apply to this case for very fact specific reasons that aren't important here.

So what does that mean for jurisprudence going forward? A few important points:

* The political process test is still alive and kicking. It can still be used to invalidate laws under Equal Protection.

* Affirmative action plans are still allowed generally. This case did nothing to overrule *Grutter,* and schools may still use race as a factor in admissions (so long as it doesn't violate state law; see below).

* A state may prohibit affirmative action by amending its constitution to prohibit all racial factors in the admissions processes of its state schools. The ruling is no more broad than this, it simply affirms that Michigan's new amendment followed all proper procedures and that its existence does not violate Equal Protection.","1"

I don't see how any law student could read it and not be enraged.  In demonstrating how black applicants were arbitrarily favored over Hispanic applicants, Rehnquist specifically cites their qualifications, which are drastically below those of non-minority students who were accepted:

&gt;For example, in 2000, 12 Hispanics who scored between a 159160 on the LSAT and earned a GPA of 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 2 were admitted. App. 200201. Meanwhile, 12 African-Americans in the same range of qualifications applied for admission and all 12 were admitted. Id., at 198. Likewise, that same year, 16 Hispanics who scored between a 151153 on the LSAT and earned a 3.00 or higher applied for admission and only 1 of those applicants was admitted. Id., at 200201. Twenty-three similarly qualified African-Americans applied for admission and 14 were admitted. Id., at 198.

Not only were black applicants preferred over Hispanics in practice but apparently being black and having a 160 on the LSAT is T14 material.  This does not engender in me feelings of racial harmony or a belief in the necessity of affirmative action.  The idea of getting into a T14 today as a white male with a 160 LSAT score -- let alone a 151-153 -- is absolutely preposterous.  ","1_1_1_1"

&gt; Does he have features of German decent, Irish, Polish, Russian? 

Irrelevant. We're talking about skin color.

&gt;Would you look at my blonde haired daughter and think she was white, then label her Hispanic/brown when she gets darker in the summer?

That depends on whether she's actually white or brown. The Hispanic label is irrelevant because it describes an ethnicity, not a skin color.

&gt;What about African-American albinos? 

White. 

&gt;Is Beyoncé black, or is she brown, based on your observation?

Brown, part-black, etc.

&gt;Labeling people like this probably wouldn't be a problem if our society didn't have a history of treating people differently based off of color, but then again what other option would you have... Judging people on who they are as a person??? Let's not be silly, we are a very image based society.

This is completely irrelevant, ironically not self-aware, and premised in numerous incorrect, preconceived notions about how I think.

You should probably argue these issues with someone who doesn't understand how broken and misused our labels of others are.","2_1_1_3_1_2_1_1_1"

In Bowen &amp; Bok's book ""The Shape of the River,"" they found that underrepresented students who got into top universities - and would probably not have gotten in were it not for affirmative action - graduated in large numbers. This is because a lot of these students who on paper don't look that excellent - they might have lower SAT scores or less extracurriculars, simply didn't have the advantages that other more privileged groups did and they would thrive if admitted.","3_3_1_1_1_1"

Anyway, if males can't hack it, I don't see a problem with leaving them behind.  In some areas, though, that isn't happening.  Males still are over represented at top percentiles on standardized tests and at top percentiles on intelligence tests.  For that reason, perhaps, the most elite law schools tend to have slightly more males (although some don't) than females.  At the most elite institutions, then, males do not need or get a preference at this point.  As illustrated by the Grutter v. Bollinger case, though, minorities received a *substantial* boost when applying to elite law schools.  Rehnquist's dissent, in fact, provides detail on how abysmal the LSAT scores of admitted minority students were.  Overall, my point is that although it shouldn't matter, those white males applying to elite institutions don't seem to have much to fear from the abolition of affirmative action.

Women are a federally-recognized ""disadvantaged minority"" and are entitled to special treatment under Affirmative Action laws. Women, apparently, already support these practices, as they have since the '60s when they fought to include themselves in them. There's no need to convince them that Affirmative Action is good because they have been entitled to its benefits since the mid-60s.

In fact, here's a piece that claims they benefit the most from Affirmative Action policies:

http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/17/affirmative-action-has-helped-white-women-more-than-anyone/

College admissions are heavily skewed toward accepting women and it's been this way for so long that a lot of young white men aren't even bothering to apply anymore because of how hostile college environments seem to them. Technically, the colleges should be doing everything in their power to increase the graduation percentages of men right now since Affirmative Action mandates quotas for everything. For men and women it should be a 50/50 split, so when you hear figures of ""57% of college graduates are women"" the college technically needs to increase the percentage of male graduates or decrease the number of women according to Affirmative Action laws. Unfortunately, as a white male, this doesn't really afford you much of an advantage since you're likely to be passed over to meet their racial quotas. If a college had its choice of a white male, black male, Hispanic male, or Asian male they're going to admit as many black males as they can, then move on to Hispanics, and then probably flip a coin for the remaining pool of whites and Asians.","6_4_1_1_1"

[Sure!](http://www.chicagobooth.edu/capideas/spring03/racialbias.html)

There's plenty more of that kind of research out there. Whites have it easy compared to every other minority in pretty much every single way. First hired, last fired, paid the most, disproportionately represented in politics, business, media. Yet they complain the loudest. It's really odd.

&gt;It would make sense that this would hurt them compared to the class president and the captain of the football team

Each of those things have exactly *one* person who can be captain, or class president. Are those the only people allowed into colleges? Why is that even the metric? Colleges are not filled with only the captains and presidents of their whatevers from high schools. I guarantee that most of the white kids who got into colleges weren't class president or captains either. There can only be so many of them. 

And shouldn't the #1 metric of school be academics anyway? Where Asians far and away outdo whites?

&gt;Can you show me stats that include adjustments for level of extracurriculars? 

Just look at the admissions data for California and Michigan before and after AA programs were banned. When race was no longer allowed to be used as a factor, Asian rates skyrocketed. White rates stayed the same. They were still allowed to consider extracurriculars and other stuff, just not race. If extracirriculars were that important to admissions *or* Asians didn't participate in them to the same degree, then you would expect that to be an advantage to whites when race is taken out of the equation.

It was a great gig but for personal reasons I had to leave and move across the country. There is massive competition for university jobs. However my previous employer was one of the top ten universities in the nation. I have references, great valid work history, a degree and certifications. I don't even get responses from open university positions.

Also university positions even in IT are very public. So I can actually see pictures of who works there. And you know strangely enough it's usually something like 75% white women. 75% white women in the IT field? And I've seen that at several universities in this state. I think that has pretty obvious ramifications for a white male seeking a job there under affirmative action. 

Competition for the places I want to work is extremely high. I get that. They are great places to work. But with that said why should I have to endure a harsh competitive disadvantage on every application I make in an already highly competitive field? How in the world can that possibly be considered fair?","7_3_1_3_2"

[But something to consider](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/08/13/white-definitions-merit-and-admissions-change-when-they-think-about-asian-americans#sthash.PQu1iMxy.dpbs).

&gt;Specifically, he found, in a survey of white California adults, they generally favor admissions policies that place a high priority on high school grade-point averages and standardized test scores. But when these white people are focused on the success of Asian-American students, their views change.

That is, when white people know they are helped by a certain policy, they are in favor of ""meritocracy."" When they know they are not as good as other groups, say Asians, they then see the need for a more diverse and less ""merit"" based system of admissions.

Laughably hypocritical. White people should understand that the only group actually being hurt in terms of admissions by AA programs are *Asian* applicants. In states like California where AA programs existed and were subsequently banned, white rates did not change at all. You are not being denied a spot because of AA program. Asians are. Because Asians are the ones who are applying with superior numbers in all aspects.

And even I, as an Asian, cannot say that AA programs are wrong. There is still widespread discrimination against minorities in this country. A black name like Jamal gets 50% fewer callbacks for jobs than a white name. Even with identical qualifications. Black people get paid less for the same job. Black people are promoted less. Black people are fired first. Blacks get longer prison sentences for the same crime. 

No one has it as good as whites in this country *and it's because of racism.* Not the KKK style racism, but the more insidious subconscious racism. Where you think that just because you don't consciously hate minorities that you don't harbor any racist tendencies. In actuality, you are constantly stereotyping minorities a certain way and punishing them for it.

They were put into place at the end of the civil rights era to aid a disproportionately discriminated against group be able to rise to the level where they could be equal to whites. That was over fifty years ago. The analogy of ""the time has come to take the training wheels off"" may sound harsh, but it isn't that far off.

Anyone supporting affirmative action.

&gt;This isn't historical. This is right now. Black people are being discriminated against right now.

Who cares?  That doesn't mean we set up a quota, because then you're being hired for what you are, not what you do.  If you want to turn black skin into your only marketable skill good luck if you lose that job.

I don't care what's happening right now.  Institutionalizing racism is not the answer.  Time is the answer.

It has a ton to do with black culture.  Being ""white"" is basically the go to insult for black people.  ""Uncle Tom"" (you associate with the whites), ""House Nigger"" (you're living life on easy street with the whites), all sorts of shit about pale skin, or how you talk, or anything else.  Basically anything to call you ""white"" is the ""low-blow"" of black people.  If you tried hard in school you're a ""sell out"" in an inner city school, you're not ""keepin' it real"" and all that other bullshit.  How are you going to be successful when you insist on keeping separate from the successful people?  How are you going to be successful when you look at the attributes that make white people successful as a negative?

You can't give them advice, because the last thing a black guy wants to hear is advice from a White man.  They've got plenty advice for white people though, a whole laundry list of changes the white folks need to make, but you suggest one back and you're a racist.  So fuck 'em, if they don't want to learn how to be successful from the race that generally is, then let them figure it out on their own.

&gt;Because you're racist.

See?  So why the fuck do I want to help a bunch of people just waiting to call me a racist and tell me all their problems are my fault?  Why do I want to hire a guy just waiting for any excuse to point the finger and then file some lawsuit?  What do I gain by having him as an employee?

It's a love hate relationship.  Black people want what white people have but they simultaneously resent white people for having it.  That's not endearing.  I didn't fucking enslave anybody and I'm not paying reparations for anyone who did.

Nobody is owed because of history.  Nobody living their regular life gives a fuck if someone got a raw deal.  Even black in America is a better deal than plenty of other people got in the world.  Like female in Saudi Arabia or Christian in Pakistan or whatever else.

I've seen tons of black people over the years so convinced the fucking ""Man"" was keeping them down, they forgot about the fact they never did anything but complain how fucked they were all day.  

Here's where the black people can start on the path to equality:  Trying having fucking fathers.  Stop knocking up girls and leaving.  Right there is half the problem.  Do we need affirmative action for non-broken households too?  Try having men raise men instead of incompetent women raising large boys.  No fucking roll models.  You want black people to have equality?  Try that for starters.

Don't kid yourself, black shoot fuck themselves in the foot at every opportunity, and then blame it on their skin color.

When discrimination is encountered, they can sue those people for discriminatory practices under the law. That's how the law works. Affirmative Action is a preventative law which causes negligent harm to innocent people.

That's a total strawman. Racism certainly still exists, but affirmative action does nothing to stop racism. It just negatively affects innocent people based on the flawed assumption that race, not economics, is a better quota or assistance system to reduce inequality.","16_3_1_1_2"

1. Those kids who are accepted still (presumably) lived through poverty and are not going to get caught up in college.  It's too little too late for many of our more discriminated against.  Most studies show that you need to intervene by early elementary school to make the difference.

2.  For those who were borderline, and it was honestly a 'tipping factor', that applicant was going to go to college regardless.  Maybe not their first choice school, but they were on the path to financial security.  Those whose lives are truly beyond help in the inner cities of America don't benefit from this policy, even though they need the help the most.

3.  If affirmative action is based on race, it will favor wealthy minorities (who likely did better in school) over poor minorities.  And it will distinctly disfavor whites living in poverty who did poorly in school for similar reasons.  Essentially, affirmative action can be viewed as a tool wealthy whites use by putting forward poor whites as their shield against having to accept any other real change (such as higher taxes to support public boarding schools).  I will also note that while a greater percent of minorities live in poverty, there is a greater number of whites who live in poverty.  We can't ignore this large group just because we have trouble directly attacking the problem.

To be totally clear, I am not denying the shitty situation America has put minorities in.  But this is a solution endorsed only by the very wealthy white population who it won't affect, and the very wealthy minority population who will most benefit.  It screws everyone else over.  If you want to make a real change in the country, support public boarding schools so kids can get out of their dangerous neighborhoods and get EARLY, HIGH-QUALITY education.

[Poverty](http://www.npc.umich.edu/poverty/) rates.  Sometimes hispanics are divided into black or white categories, though interestingly when you separate them out they become the largest group by number, with whites being the second largest group, and blacks 3rd.  Of course,  I don't think it should be terribly surprising that when separated hispanics top the list as many are undocumented therefore unable to seek employment.  Overall, I hope it is not surprising that so many whites are in poverty.  Remember African Americans make up 14% of the population.  Even when discriminated against, it's hard to make up for all the white people who live in Kentucky or Oklahoma. 

[Early Intervention](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/364/transcript). There are a lot of studies on this one, but I find the best way to get the message across is to listen to this very moving episode of This American Life.

Is it the government's job to legislate equal results in society? Hell no. What the government is responsible for is providing equal treatment to citizens, and they took a step forward today in that respect.

We hung them, and killed them off. Those that resisted we tortured to death to make an example of. 

For the majority only those big strong dumb field nergos were allowed to go on to breed and make more baby slaves.

This selective breeding occurred for at least 400 years.

We need to start a national initiative to dump trillions of dollars into experimentation to increase the Intelligence and I.Q. of all humans. 

Only once we are truly free and beyond the constraints of genetic I.Q. limitations can we move beyond the concept of race.

Race will become meaningless once we are all intellectual giants. 

This will not be achieved unless we take genetics by the throat and squeeze out a new future for our species. 

To finally kill the last remnants of racism we need to destroy mental limitations that lead to ignorance. 

Boosting human memory, boosting the ability to quickly retrieve stored information are paramount to advancing our species into a new golden age of humanity.

In the UK, being disabled in the 2010s meant you were twice as likely to be unemployed, irrespective of whether you are able to work. It's that much harder to get a job, which naturally then puts you at a disadvantage within society. So many large employers agreed to a scheme where any self declared disabled person, should they meet the essential job criteria of any job they apply for, are guaranteed at least an interview. This is called the two tick scheme, and it has been very helpful to increase employment amongst the disabled. Of course, it is also one of the few forms of legal affirmative action in the UK. 

All this to say that for some reason, when it comes to disability (one of the largest areas in employment discrimination issues), people are all ears and understand why you might need reasonable initiatives to counteract prejudice. But if you do it with race for the same sort of reasons, people go apeshit, no matter how carefully you can explain all the unfair disadvantages some races face whether you have an affirmative action policy or not.","4_3"

Throwing money at ""under funded"" schools hasn't elicited the results that people thought it would. 


As I said, almost all studies show that education rate is actually a lot more tied to the at home environment (stability and a two parent household to be more detailed). 

&gt; In countries without private schools, public education thrives because the wealthy families invest in them.

There are no first world countries without private schools. In fact, in  the UK there are way more private schools I believe.","10_1_1_1_2_1"

As far as the US spending more than other countries, yes that is true, but it's also more complex than that. 

&gt; [The way the money is spent isn't always equally distributed or particularly logical. School districts in some states spend more to educate wealthy students than poorer ones.
Court cases have forced states to divide the money more equally. But often that just increases the overall pot of money rather than redistributing it  even though the spending increases appear to make a difference in students' lives.](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/25/8284637/school-spending-US)

When California ended affirmative action in its college applications two decades ago, the number of black students being admitted to top-tier institutions such as Berkeley did decline, while the number of Asian students admitted increased.

If you don't care about the history, skip it. The application to this case will still make sense. Source: I'm a lawyer. 

**History and reasoning of Equal Protection Law:** The [14th Amendment](http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) Clause 1 prohibits a state from denying anyone ""the equal protection of the laws.""  Basically this means that a government cannot make arbitrary laws that discriminate against people *in the same class.* Why must they be in the same class? Because laws must discriminate to some extent to have any efficacy. For example, in [Railway Express Inc. v. New York](http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/336/106/case.html), when trucks used solely for advertising were prohibited by New York, the truck owners filed suit alleging a violation of Equal Protection. The Court denied this protection because advertisement trucks served a different purpose than regular trucks, thus they were not in the same class or *similarly situated* that Equal Protection would apply. 

So the question becomes, what makes a class *similarly situated?* There is a straightforward, albeit somewhat unsatisfying, answer to the question: the Court receives cases and uses them to determine what classes are similarly situated (thus receiving some level of Equal Protection) and those that are not (no Equal Protection given). This is usually liberally construed, with groups like race, gender, age, and other factors being used by the Court and the state.

But surely all classes, even those similarly situated, are not given the same protections. For example, a law banning skimmed milk products and a law prohibiting blacks from going to all white schools both affect a given group of similarly situated individuals. But there are important differences: 

1. The government has important reasons for regulating milk markets, such as health concerns, confusion of products, and regulation of economic markets. There are fewer reasons for simply stopping blacks from entering white schools.

2. Blacks in the US have been discriminated against solely on the basis of race for many years. Milk producers, meanwhile, do not have such a history.

3. There is some animus or hatred associated with prohibiting blacks from mingling with whites. This institutionalized animosity is not present against milk producers. 


So there must be some important way to evaluate some cases in which the government has good reason to discriminate against members of a similarly situated class, and situations in which no such reason exists. The Court has, over time, developed several levels of scrutiny, the idea being that different classes require different levels of scrutiny for various reasons.  

1. **Rational basis test** this test requires a law be *""rationally related"" to achieve a ""legitimate government interest.""* Translation: pick any reason, and link it in some way to an actual government interest. If that's accomplished, the law is valid, and no Equal Protection violations have occurred. This applies to any ordinary right, and is used for a vast majority of laws, including those that discriminate against economic actors (commerce regulations), geographic buildings (zoning laws), and safety provisions (arresting murder suspects). The burden of proving this is on the person claiming an Equal Protection violation has occurred. 

1. **Intermediate scrutiny** this test is for a right that is perhaps a bit more fundamental, so we want the government to provide further justification before taking it away via discrimination of a similarly situated class. Intermediate scrutiny requires *any classification must serve an important governmental objective and be substantially related to achievement of those objectives*.The most common class under this standard is gender. It is not given even higher scrutiny because, as we will see with those observed under strict scrutiny, this class is not an insular minority, nor are laws creating distinctions between members made out of hatred. Rather there are actually reasons for requiring differences. It is a good idea, for example, to have separate bathrooms for men and women. But this is not always true: [there is no important governmental objective in prohibiting beer sales to males under 21 but to females under 18. 
](http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2528522570594071994&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr)
1. **Strict scrutiny**the highest standard, requires the government demonstrate a ""compelling interest"" that is ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve that purpose. This standard applies to classifications that are made with malice, hatred, basically those that seem to be using governmental power improperly to promote systemic superiority of a majority. Race naturally falls into this category, thus it is the burden on the government to demonstrate why a law classifying people based on race is so important. 


So in addressing racial classifications, the Court almost always considers there be no compelling interest in the government treating people differently based on race, and thus the law violates Equal Protection. This is most clearly articulated in cases such as [Brown v. Board of Education](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education) and [Bolling v. Sharpe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolling_v._Sharpe). Even affirmative action, contrary to what people typically believe, is not allowed in most settings. Why? Because it still classifies people based on race. The only difference between a law prohibiting blacks from white schools and a law requiring a contractor hire a minority run subcontractor is that one benefits the majority while one the minority. 

Setting aside that general rule, one important area the government does have a compelling interest to promote is diversity in schools. This was notably articulated in 2003 by two cases originating in Michigan: [Grutter v. Bollinger](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZS.html) and [Gratz v. Bollinger](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-516.ZS.html). Basically, diversity is super important in education because different thoughts create a much more varied learning structure that is more beneficial than just one line of thinking. So it's a compelling interest to discriminate somewhat on the basis of race. What made these two cases different, however, is that one discriminated by quota, the other with race as a ""plus 1"" factor. The quota was not narrowly tailored, not the least discriminatory method of achieving this interest, so it violated Equal Protection. The ""plus 1"" factor later used in this Texas case is narrowly tailored, so it's allowed. 

Thus the stage is set for Fisher v. Texas.



**Application to this case:** So strict scrutiny requires a ""compelling interest"" that is ""narrowly tailored"" to achieve that purpose. The first step in any Equal Protection claim is to determine the class and which level of scrutiny should apply. We're going to set that aside for the moment: while that is sometimes at issue (see this [other case](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/12a0386p-06.pdf) going before the Supreme Court next term) but it isn't here because race is agreed upon by everyone in this context to be under the standard of strict scrutiny.

So we enter a two step process: (1) is there a compelling interest to use race in admissions? and (2) is the way the government went about achieving that interest narrowly tailored (aka ""least restrictive"" means)?

As stated above in the 2003 U of M cases, diversity in school is a compelling interest. In this way a school sort of gets a ""pass"" when a court examines its racial policies: the Court presumes its thinking of diversity when it classifies based on race, so it moves to see whether the policy is narrowly tailored, i.e. the least restrictive method available. 

In this case of Fischer v. Texas, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals correctly used strict scrutiny and gave the school its proper deference for achieving diversity as a reason for classifying based on race. What it did not do properly, however, was require the school to prove why the educational policies are narrowly tailored. The 5th Circuit applied the same deference and just assumed that the policy used by Texas is narrowly tailored, and moved on. The Supreme Court is telling the Court of Appeals to go back and require the University of Texas to prove exactly why its policies are the least restrictive means of achieving its purpose of diversity in the classroom. The Court cannot just defer to the school or state and presume its program is narrowly tailored. The government must prove why that's true. 


**TL;DR**: The University didn't meet the required burden for a racial classification under Equal Protection, even for one promoting diversity in the classroom. So it has to go back and prove why its method is the least restrictive means available.  ","1"

Strict scrutiny must not be strict in theory but feeble in fact. In order for judicial review to be meaningful, a university must make a showing that its plan is narrowly tailored to achieve the only interest that this Court has approved in this context: the benefits of a student body diversity that encompasses a . . . broa[d] array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.

Basically what Kennedy is saying is that the lower court did not apply strict scrutiny correctly, in the court's opinion the lower court gave deference to the University's argument that it's plan to achieve diversity was narrowly tailored to meet the goal.  The lower court should have given no deference and judged for itself whether there were any other race-neutral alternatives to achieve the diversity produced by the program they had in place.  

So he's saying the lower court applied the strict scrutiny test wrong.  He is accusing the lower courts of being to lenient, producing the line:  strict scrutiny cant be really tough to meet in theory, but then be easily met when applied by the courts.  And he throws in with the first line that it also can't be strict in theory but impossible to meet when applied by the courts.  Really that whole paragraph is just sort of fluff to finish out the opinion and not any sort of usable legal ruling.

Specifically, the racial measure must be ""narrowly tailored to a compelling government end."" This standard is often considered ""strict in theory, fatal in fact."" In fact, a minor boost to the overall ""score"" of a minority application for the purpose of encouraging diversity in higher education is the *only* example of a measure considered both ""narrowly tailored"" and aimed at ""a compelling government end."" Even within that framework any indication that a number of seats are reserved for minority students or otherwise inaccessible to white males is unconstitutional. Here, the Court was concerned that the TX Supreme Court hadn't appropriately applied the Strict Scrutiny standard, instead basing their decision on their preferred selection of cases demonstrating a tendency to allow universities to consider race as a factor in admissions (possibly ignoring a number of cases demonstrating that not all methods of doing so are constitutional). The TX SC did not, however, correctly apply the Strict Scrutiny standard to UT's particular method, so it is being sent back with instructions that the TX SC is to look at the case again more critically.

EDIT: Also, it is a little known fact that discrimination based upon race, gender, religion, etc is NOT per set illegal. But, the discrimination must meet the Strict Scrutiny standard above - it must be for *very* good reasons, must be the only possible way to achieve that end, and must be as absolutely minimal as possible.

""This morning, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of Fisher v. The University of Texas at Austin, in which the plaintiff challenged any consideration of race in the admissions process. The University's policy considers race as one among many factors in a holistic review of applicants who are not admitted automatically by the state's Top 10 Percent Law.

Today, the Court vacated and remanded the Fisher case back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, finding that the lower court had not applied a strict enough standard when it found in favor of the University. It is important to note that the Court did not say race could not be considered, as the current law permits. Today's ruling has no impact on admissions decisions we have already made or any immediate impact on our holistic admissions policy.

For many years, The University of Texas at Austin has been a leading advocate for diversity in higher education. As we argued before the Court, we believe a diverse student body is critical to the education of all students. It creates a rich learning environment that prepares young people for life in an increasingly global society. Because we remain convinced of this truth, and because diversity is critical to our becoming America's best public university, we will continue to defend our policy.

Why is it that people so strongly oppose considering ethnicity in the application process, but not special consideration granted to children of alumni, athletes, and people of certain religions or regions? Do these factors have any influence on merit? How is it equal to allow certain students to present these qualities while restricting the ability for minorities to express their own background?

It seems that the argument used most often is that these practices are no longer necessary under the pretense that racism is no longer an issue. Granted, we've come a long way since the days of Jim Crow, and while discrimination is no longer common practice, the fact remains that [Caucasian households still control the majority of wealth.](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0721.pdf) and  [earn more on average than Blacks and Hispanics.](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0701.pdf) This coupled with other aspects that colleges consider, such as extracurriculars and athletics, that are more available to families with more wealth and income, greatly skews the application process against students from low income backgrounds. Seeing as how higher education is key to reducing this income inequality that makes higher education so unobtainable for Black and Hispanic students, is there not some burden on our society to compensate for the consequences of our past transgressions?

I understand that this is a very complex and controversial issue, and I wanted to express the other side of the argument. It's crucial that we consider all perspectives of this issue rather than oversimplifying as ""reverse racism.""","2"

Then I suppose that poses the question as to why none of the other aspects mentioned have received the same amount of opposition as AA.

&gt;Athletes are granted special consideration because they have a special skill 

How does athletic skill affect the quality of a college's education? If we recognize the institution's right to apply scrutiny in order to improve the performance of its teams should we not also recognize its right to apply scrutiny in order to create a diverse campus?

Also households with greater income have more money for equipment and other expenses, as well as more time to devote to practices and events. Doesn't the act of granting special consideration to athletes give a greater advantage to ethnicities with more income and the means to pursue athletic activities?","2_1_1"

The attempt to increase diversity of economic backgrounds and ethnicity is a positive addition to the educational experience for all students. Many students come from areas with very homogenous populations and college can often be the one time in their lives that students have the opportunity to interact with others of varying ethnic backgrounds and economic situations. I think the interaction is key to reducing the tendency to segregate ourselves. It's an invaluable experience. It would be a shame to lose that in the process of making things fair across the board.

The guy said a few years back the university got dinged for their minority enrollment (they barely had any). My first thought when he said this was that there are tons of Native reservations around so why would that be an issue. The university basically said the state doesn't have any diversity--forgetting the Native population. And of course they were reminded of them.

I told my husband and he said, ""That's not their fault if they're not applying.""

This made me realize how important it is for these quotas because those Native populations are marginalized and so many have no idea that college education is an option. But if that university goes to the reservations and inspires and encourages just one or two kids and shows them that a university education is attainable and in reach, then they will dare to reach. 

It's so sad to see how even big universities receiving a diverse pool of applications needs affirmative action. A university should be on the cutting edge of education and change... Not backwards. ","8"

The outcome I'm talking about is getting accepted to college, not what happens once you're in or after you graduate.  If there's a group that's not meeting the requirements of admission, that means there are underlying issues that need to be addressed.  Simply lowering the standards for this group to get the end-game numbers up to where you want them to be does nothing to address the problem.  Imagine you were making a monthly household budget in Excel.  You have all your income and expenses in the spreadsheet.  Your salary, car payment, rent/mortgage, how much you can spend on lunch each day, etc.  When you get to the total, you see your expenses are greater than your income and you're going to be $1,000 in the red each month.  You could either go back into the sheet and adjust your expenses to get your budget in line, or you could just add +$1,000 to the total.

Bringing in students that aren't prepared is a bad choice as it just creates unnecessary failure. 

The truth is, many minority students don't comprehend the option that is college and the availability of funds. They just don't get that it is a real option for them. By going to them and mentoring and cultivating a goal and confidence it will enable students to reach further.

He was talking about ""mismatch theory"" which posits that in some cases when you admit minorities into schools they otherwise wouldn't have been qualified for, they perform more poorly than they would have at a lower ranked school, or flunk out, and that doesn't fulfill affirmative action's purpose.

None of this is happening on the court. It's happening in the arena of public affairs. Pundits and politicians are condemning a statement by a justice whose views they find repugnant, so as to motivate their followers. That's their prerogative. We have open supreme court hearings for a reason -- so people can consider them, and respond to them.

It would be a huge mistake to accuse or offend a Justice in proceedings. But this obviously falls back on the trend this country has of trying to decide things outside of court and being totally ignorant of how and why we have court procedures. The court of public opinion essentially. The kind of court which would condemn innocent men for no other reason than it fits a narrative that appeals to the masses, making it impossible for them to have a normal life even after being acquitted. That's a social trend that this country needs to stop, even if its just as simple as the opinions and questions presented in the supreme court.

Also, I've learned it's not a good idea to assume you know how a supreme court justice will vote. The course of history in this country has been shaped by supreme court decisions which were logical yet unpopular for their time, and even unpopular with the economic and cultural demographic the justices themselves represented. They might not be someone you tend to agree with, but they're there to listen to arguments and render a verdict based on the logic and evidence presented by both sides. Even though they may agree with one side originally, it's still possible for them to see that the other side's argument has merit, or that the side which represents their original opinion fumbled the ball. 

Sometimes a Supreme Court justice will surprise you. And people forget this, but that's precisely why they have lifetime appointments. The purpose was to remove any chance that they may seek favors in exchange for votes because they have no higher office to seek and no need to run for reelection. The problem is that money and ideology can still be strong influences.","4_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

Scalia is not going to be surprising anyone in this ruling. He's made his opinion on affirmative action abundantly clear in past cases, and he's made it clear once again during oral arguments. Scalia thinks affirmative action is unconstitutional -- period, end of story. No argument being presented to the court would change his mind. And no public condemnation would, either. And for those gearing up for an election campaign for the executive official that gets to appoint supreme court justices, making it clear how important they are is a legitimate tactic.

Yale, where Thomas and Sotomayor went, were aggressively pushing affirmative action in their acceptances in the 70s, as was Columbia, where Obama went. Peter Wallison, who was on the White House council when Scalia was hired, claimed his Italian ancestry was a reason Reagan nominated him.

If you think so, then I don't think you're being nearly superlatively strictly originalist enough to be consistent with the musings of Scalia that I'm comparing to.

The 14th Amendment was passed a mere 28 years before Plessy v Ferguson, which upheld laws *requiring* racial segregation on trains.

The idea of integrated colleges wouldn't even have been a twinkle in the drafters of the 14th Amendment's eyes, much less the idea of admissions processes comparing blacks and whites for the same spot.

If they couldn't even imagine it, then a *strict* originalist could hardly claim they meant to address it. That would be *loose* originalism.


I happen to think loose originalism is much more reasonable than strict originalism. But Scalia doesn't, or at least he didn't when women's equal rights were on the line, which is why I am accusing him of hypocrisy.

The idea of integrated colleges would not have been a twinkle in the drafters eyes is true however the idea of complete equality was.  If 2 students apply for a college with the same gpa. One gets accepted because of racial quotas and one is turned away this is no longer equality but preferential treatment.  
The 14th amendment states everyone is equal and not to give preferential treatment based on race. The AA is kind of the opposite of this.  If there are 2 students applying for one spot should the decision be made on race alone? Or are you saying it is only wrong if they chose the white student? Shouldnt there be an equal way to determine who gets accepted? 

Or the scenario to which Scalia is referring to a student gets accepted with an inferior gpa to meet quotas. That student is let in on quota alone and not merit he will struggle. There is a reason for academic standards for admission. If you dont meet them you probably will not be successful at that school.  If you go to a college that meets your academic level you have more of a chance for success.

I'm *not* saying we shouldn't apply the 14th Amendment to modern day instances of racial discrimination. I think we ought to apply it, even when those instances are radically different than the specific instances the drafters would have been seeing. Equal treatment for all people under the law ought to mean precisely what it sounds like.

What I'm saying is that *Scalia* has previously espoused a philosophy that would apparently require us to ignore modern day instances of discrimination too different from what the founders saw and were probably thinking of. Strict Originalism. He used this philosophy to argue that women don't (legally, under the 14th Amendment) deserve equal treatment under the law. He thought that women don't count as ""people"" for 14th Amendment purposes.

I am criticizing him *for being hypocritical to this philosophy (Strict Originalism)* by applying it only when it suits him. He applied it there, but not here.

I'm *not* saying I want him to apply the philosophy more. I'd be happier if he made himself consistent by applying it less. For instance, by acknowledging that women are people who have equal treatment under the law per the 14th Amendment.

I'm simply pointing out his hypocrisy.

I agree that they shouldn't be left to do everything themselves, however, that does not mean that they should take the place of those who have through hard work and dedication earned higher scores at their school.

That is not exactly true. Not only does that ignore indentured servitude and debt prisons which were/are a form of slavery(and sometimes lasted entire lifetimes). It also ignores that in some states one black great-grandparent is all that was required to be a 'negro' slave, meaning that people that looked and were considered white were held as slaves.

I am a first generation immigrant. That has nothing to do with me. 

Nor do I think that this guilt should grant them more than a formal apology and recognition of their ancestors suffering. The people that actually were slaves did deserve more, their childrens childrens children, do not.

Did the government act incorrectly when it freed the slaves? Yes, it should have helped them more, they at the very least deserved back pay for all the years they served. But that has little baring on what the black people of America need or deserve today.

My family came here with little more than the clothes on our backs. We were refugees from a nation that killed people by the millions because they were undesirables. Did I mention my family was not of the desirable race? Upon coming here we got the same government assistance that any out of work individual can apply for. Was some help needed? Yes. Did we need special help that was greater than what people of other ethnicitys have access to, in honor of our suffering or because we had so little? No. My family is now middle class, all the family members that came here as kids have finished universities etc... It took 15 years rather than 150 years.

Then you should be working against corruption, not giving a minority a head-start simply for the sake of being a minority. If the college has only a certain number of spaces, elevating someone based on race is discriminating against someone based on race as well. It doesn't matter if it's the person in the racial majority who got in OR the person in the racial minority, it's still discrimination against the other.

This is ""de facto"" discrimination. How in the world does it make sense to fight de facto discrimination with legislative discrimination? You're only going to create more victims, except they'll be on the opposite end, which will make the original problem that much worse.

(Ex: Person A is color/sex 1.

That's only true if an applicant is automatically given ""head-start simply for the sake of being a minority"" rather than allowing an organization to consider race in the application/interview process.  The former is [illegal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger), the latter is perfectly [acceptable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger). This is especially important because,in terms of college admissions, ""qualified"" can't necessarily be broken down to a set of numbers, there is lot of judgment involved. AA in terms of a college applications is allowing admissions officers to use as a criterion when it may be relevant (and *not* automatically as you implied).

&gt;2) that colleges only care about the scores.

They also care about extra curricular activities, essay you write them about yourself and your goals etc.

How does being born black make you more qualified than volunteering at nursing homes, running the student council at the high school or showing great writing ability?

I really don't see how or why someones race should enter the discussion unless you want a less qualified person to get the spot of a more qualified one.

&gt;You're arguing with MLKJr's words.

Sorry, I like to nitpick and that particular part of the quote is demonstratively false. 

Doesn't lessen the goal of this great man to eliminate racism, which the court does not appear to want.

&gt;Whites with criminal records are more likely to get a job callback than equally-qualified blacks without criminal records.

I agree with you that this is discrimination. I also agree that we should fight this discrimination by both passing laws against it and educating our children that discrimination is never ok, no matter the circumstances, but not with legalizing more discrimination.

That doesn't even make any sense, not only does that make everyone see that discrimination in favor of your preferred race is ok, not only does it create a dislike for black people among those who have relatives/ friends or have themselves applied to college and were rejected do to their perception that their spots were taken by less qualified black people.(this is true especially since American children are #1 in believing in their abilities despite being dead last among western nations on most tests) It also creates the perception that black people that have graduated from college are inferior in some way to non-black people that graduated. The perception created for black people that didn't get into college would likely be even worse, after all, they weren't good enough to get in, even with the discrimination that is designed to help them, so just how bad were their grades?

We can only wonder how much of the discrimination among the job call backs is based on an irrational dislike for black people among racists and how much is based on the perceptions that our legal racism creates. Either way, the best way to combat it is by fighting ALL racism equally. Not by legalizing more racism...","2_1_1_1_2"

The only way you could do that would be to ban all donations. There would be zero support for that.

&gt;not that poor black people need to be given the spots of poor white/asian/latino people with higher scores based on the color of their skin.

Again, you write that as those scores &amp; grades are the only criteria that colleges are looking for. They aren't.

&gt;How does being born black make you more qualified than volunteering at nursing homes, running the student council at the high school or showing great writing ability?

Being a black male (or any number of other ethnicity/gender/ability combinations) has it's own set of disadvantages, and overcoming those obstacles can speak to your character, determination, and other values that a school may be looking  for. It's not about being more (or less) ""qualified"" it's about the right mix of students.

&gt; Doesn't lessen the goal of this great man to eliminate racism, which the court does not appear to want

The  court decision was right in line with what ""this great man"" wanted. 

&gt; not with legalizing more discrimination.

Affirmative action is not ""legalizing"" discrimination, it's allowing the use of race/ethnicity/gender/other factors in recruiting and admission decisions. Merit is still the driving force behind the final decisions (but ""merit"" /= ""test scores alone""). 

&gt; We can only wonder how much of the discrimination among the job call

We can wonder all we want, that fact is that it happens.","2_1_1_1_2_1"

Just because people would not support this kind of battle against inequality does not mean that we should support more inequality to 'balance the scales', it is not balancing anything, merely adding more inequality.

&gt;Again, you write that as those scores &amp; grades are the only criteria that colleges are looking for. They aren't.

They should however be the primary criteria and not be secondary to what you look like.

&gt;Being a black male (or any number of other ethnicity/gender/ability combinations) has it's own set of disadvantages, and overcoming those obstacles can speak to your character, determination, and other values that a school may be looking for.

Basing the decision on the obstacles and character is perfectly valid. That is something that people outline in the essays they write to the universities. Being black, however should not automatically suggest that you had any of these obstacles nor should being white suggest that you did not face them. 

For example, in this nation I am simply considered white. That does not mean that I have never faced racism. That does not mean that I did not have racial slurs said to me. That does not mean I did not have teachers straight out tell me that there was no way they would ever let someone of my race pass in their class. That does not make the racist bastards that tried to murder me for being the wrong race when I was 10 simply disappear.

&gt;It's not about being more (or less) ""qualified"" it's about the right mix of students.

And that right there is the problem. You don't need a mix of specific races among students. You need a mix of the most qualified ones. University is preparation for entering job fields, we always want the most qualified people to enter any and all job fields. The qualification can come from the challenges the student himself faced and things a student was able to overcome but not because of the challenges that people of his race in general have to overcome.

&gt;The court decision was right in line with what ""this great man"" wanted.

He wanted his children judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin, the court decided that they can be judged by their skin color, how is that in line with what he wanted?

&gt;Affirmative action is not ""legalizing"" discrimination, it's allowing the use of race/ethnicity/gender/

That is exactly what racial discrimination is, that is not ok, that should never be ok. Not if we want to end racism.

&gt;other factors in recruiting and admission decisions. Merit is still the driving force behind the final decisions (but ""merit"" /= ""test scores alone"").

As I have said, there are plenty of other factors besides test scores alone that are part of merit. That is perfectly fine. Race/ethnicity/gender however should not be one of those factors.

&gt;We can wonder all we want, that fact is that it happens.

The reason we have to wonder is because people like you think it happens only because of racist people. While the truth of the matter is that it often happens because of the logical conclusions that non-racist people draw from our racist policies which you support.

Your solution is to support more racism because that will somehow fix the problem, while it might do the exact opposite. 

Racism does not breed equality, it breeds more racism. That is why we must end racist policies, like affirmative action, where ever they may be.","2_1_1_1_2_1_1"

Btw, Scalia has a long history of racist comments. It's not exactly controversial to call him a racist. Of course, alot of that has to do with his age and everything, but still.

In your edit.  
  
&gt;And how can you not give a thoughtful response to what I posted?  
  
Because I thought you were just racist trash.  You're not worth being thoughtful towards.  
  
Two posts.  Eight sentences in the first, ten in the second.  Three uses of ""racist"" in the first post, four uses in the second post.  That's why I think you're a racist.  You drop the word a lot.  
  
Not to mention repeated use of ""fact is"", without anything to back it up other than opinion.  Or the declaration of a theory being debunked, without bothering to link to anything about it.  
  
And the ""it's okay to declare Scalia racist over this, because he's been racist before"".  Pretty sure there's a fallacy for that, y'know?  
  
You're a racist.  You are too focused on race as being a factor.  You exhibit a belief that race should be the end-all-be-all of an issue.

I'm basing this off of a [study a few years back](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/04/homophobic_maybe_you_re_gay_the_new_york_times_on_a_new_study_of_secret_sexuality_.html) regarding homophobia.  They way I see it, people that seem too focused no a negative attribute they see at large, may well be attempting to compensate for sensing that negative attribute in themselves.  
  
Then again, I come from the standpoint that [xenophobia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RovF1zsDoeM) came from an evolutionary need at one point, and we're currently in the midst of a social (as opposed to physical) evolution concerning where that particular trait should go (it sometimes seems to be becoming more religious than just ethnic).

The studies say that people that *are* homophobic tend to be closeted. That's due to people being insecure about their sexuality. 

I don't see how this relates to racism. I guess you could say I'm insecure about the topic of racism because I secretly am one. Therefore i bring it up all the time. This just doesn't ring true to me. I don't feel that I have negative beliefs about people of other races. I think I talk about it a lot because its my belief that it is everywhere and it needs to be talked about and called out. 

I don't know, to me, most of the people that bring up ""people who bring up racism are actually the racists!"" arguments always tend to be people that disagree with Idea X being racist, because they agree with Idea X. So they are basically saying ""no, I'm not a racist, you are!"" They never actually can explain it.

I don't necessarily hold this view of you, specifically, after our dialogue to this point, but I certainly feel that a number of anti-racist people are, themselves, merely trying to prove how non-racist or anti-racist they are, instead of accepting the simple truth that the human mind remains an eternally multi-faceted, confusing, complex system of weird shit that we'll never fully understand within our personal lifetimes.","3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1"

&gt; WASHINGTON - In a 2003 decision that the majority said it expected would last for 25 years, the Supreme Court allowed public colleges and universities to take account of race in admission decisions.

&gt; It would, all sides agree, reduce the number of African-American and Latino students at nearly every selective college and graduate school, with more Asian-American and white students gaining entrance instead. A decision barring the use of race in admission decisions would undo an accommodation reached in the Supreme Court&amp;#039;s 5-to-4 decision in 2003 in Grutter v. Bollinger: that public colleges and universities could not use a point system to increase minority enrollment but could take race into account in vaguer ways to ensure academic diversity.

&gt; The case has idiosyncrasies that may limit its reach, but it also has the potential to eliminate diversity as a rationale sufficient to justify any use of race in admission decisions - the rationale the court endorsed in the Grutter decision.

Black students fail more because black students tend to come from harsher neighborhoods with less stability. When you have to get on a bus and go to a public library to have access to a computer or the internet, there is an economic gap causing the grade drop.

You fix the economic disparity and you fix the issue. Stop making it about race and start making it about the economy. That will get a unified front of multiple races of people to fix the issue.
