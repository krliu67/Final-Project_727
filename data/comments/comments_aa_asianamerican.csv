Having race be a factor in affirmative action (like in your example for a scholarship) instead of just the student and parents' economic status is racist in itself. 

&gt;Asian Americans need SAT scores 140 points higher than whites and about 400 scores higher than black and hispanic high school students to get into elite schools with all other variables being equal according to Yukong Zhao, chairman of the Asian American Coalition for education. 

It's heartbreaking that they assume they are competing in a purely merit based system like in most countries in the world, and then it turns out their racial identity, which they have no way of changing, is being used against them in the US. And used in favor of some other group (preferential treatment). 

It doesn't help that Asians are one of the smallest groups in national politics, so they do not have a lot of voting power compared to the groups that are afforded preferential treatment.

Usually the wakeup call comes too late for those parents, in the form of rejection letters from colleges, for their children.","1_2"

Nice theory.

If AA's had only 20%, and AA's were in the same category as Whites, then why didn't AA's get more admitted over less qualified white applicants?

Even if you abolished Affirmative Action, what makes you think that they won't just give that 10% to the White applicants?

The thing is, Affirmative Action didn't make the Ivies cap the Asians.  Admitting more African Americans and Latinos doesn't mean they had to Cap Asians.  By pure competition, Asian students should have admitted more than many White applicants.

~30% asian, still has affirmative action (similar URM proportions as the ivies), Northeastern school, very prestigious, etc.

The difference? 97%+ STEM, no legacy preference, D3 athletics. There's your 10% compared to Harvard's 20%

There's a very real issue of homogeneity among Asian applicants that creates artificial competition. We disproportionately apply for STEM, and we pursue similar extracurriculars e.g., from high school youth and all state orchestras to my college orchestra and orchestras at similar elite schools, we made up 2/3 or more of the violin section. Not hard to realize how this happens.

I'd also note that recent classes seem to have seen upticks in proportions of asians, iirc. Duke and Columbia come to mind as two schools with near 30% proportions in recent classes

Berkeley is skewed by Cali's high Asian population. Caltech could be an improvement and is ""purely meritocratic"" but is also impacted by that, and I know a lot of MIT kids who chose it over Caltech because of the environment (only recently has the male female ratio started coming close to being balanced for example).

And what the article misses is that like gender, geography, extracurriculars, etc., is that race is part of diversity as well.

I am coming from the position someone who is Asian, has an Asian last name, dealt with the sequelae of low education/poverty throughout my family (physical abuse, cousins who were sexually abused, an uncle who contracted and died of AIDS from selling blood and dirty needles, a cousin who spent countless times in an out of jail because of his involvement in triads, a large number of family members who died young and early due to very preventable diseases, etc). I went to a very *latino* school district where educational outcomes were poor. Throughout my childhood, no one gave me a helping hand. I was told time and again, ""You're smart and Asian, you'll be fine."" **No, I was smart because I worked my a$$ off.** Unlike many Asian parents, my parents were too busy working blue collar jobs to force me into a string of extracurriculars. I earned my place and my career. 

I've spent more than the last decade in academia and I've met **so many** Asians with stories like mine. **We work twice as hard to go half as far.** I've seen so many kids from privileged Nigerian and Ethiopian backgrounds with well-off parents who are then given additional opportunities that **people who look like us do not get.** It's insulting.

What you're really talking about in your comment is issues of economic class.

I'd like to clarify with the following:

1. **AA vs Class.** Affirmative action in the US  is not about poverty per se. Originally it was about ""race, creed, color, or national origin"" and of course was extended to other groupings including gender, gender orientation, disability, etc. Less so the discrimination of being from a poor background.

2. **Diversity vs Student quality.** Schools can deal with ethnic diversity, because that has little to do with academic performance. How? Like you said, well-off international African students are coveted because they bring cultural networking capital, *whilst* meeting the intellectual standards set by the schools. Remember that AA decisions are made between students who are equally talented. (For some reason, people tend to forget this, and rationalize instead that an academically worse student gets switched ina study about Californian residents showed this, and in reality the elite schools will avoid bringing in weak students because that doesn't serve their interest, which is to assemble the cream of the crop.)

3. **Class vs Student quality.** Schools can't deal well with economic class. Your SAT scores are a strong correlator with economic class, that's well known (just google the concept SES). Consequence? If you are from the ""wrong"" class, the school is taking a risk because they're going to get a student who might not perform as well.

Now, I think the above describes a terrible system and status quo. But I also think you unintentionally stir controversy into this by mixing up two issues, and jumping to an invalid conclusion by blaming AA, because the real issue is college institutions not being accountable for class inequity.

If you want economic class inequality to be accommodated somehow, through AA or otherwise, then let's start by being clear about that as the core issue. I'd buy this argument and I'm sure other progressives would, too.

But seriously, keeping the AA system as it is is just plain stupid imo. We need bigger educational reform for districts/neighborhoods with crappy schools, we need to reduce young URM males' incarceration rates, etc... AA does little for the root of the issue because it already assumes that you, as a URM, are a student in a position to be considering higher education in the first place. In other words, you're in an environment where you are able to participate in extracurriculars and get a good GPA, form relationships with teachers for recs, write essays, pay for college apps, be able to navigate complicated financial aid stuff like FAFSA, etc. (all of this which is already geared towards kids who grew up in middle class environments or better -- and these kids are not the ones who lack opportunity that AA **should** be geared towards...)","2_4_1_1_1_1"

Tertiary education is a critical social institution, which is why regulation is needed. AA is supposed to do this through an intergenerational process.

And that's not OK. Neither is holding a lower class Asian student back just because of their race.

&gt;The last tier is comprised of predetermined factors  gender, geographic location, and ethnicity.

&gt;It frustrates me to share that predetermined factors even play a role in determining college admission. After all, these factors dont represent the academic merits or the personality of the candidate. The reality is that their significance becomes relevant when colleges try to maintain balances of gender, geographic distribution, and race.

Into a shutdown just on race, as if race wasn't part of the diversity balance here. You also ignore how academic interests/focus, extracurricular activities, and even personality, come into play as part of a diverse campus.

First of all, there's a reason these factors come into play; there are so many damn qualified applicants. Thousand of valedictorians. 200k+ students scoring 2100+ on the SAT. What's a school to do?  Harvard caliber students are everywhere in the other Ivies, and at Duke, UChicago, Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc.

At a certain level, it's about distribution of so many qualified students and these additional factors are in place to create a kind of environment. And because you can't have an orchestra with just violinists (which flows into the homogeneity issue of asian american applicants). And while a lot of elite schools have different flavors, my experience of visiting friends at a many of them and comparing theirs to mine is that they offer fairly similar experiences in the end.

And this is my point, the minorities coming to top tier schools through AA are not as qualified as rest of the applicants. Sure, the lower qualifications are understandable if that applicant came from a rougher background, the state of AA today doesn't take that into account. It doesn't ask about your circumstances or you income level. Instead, it groups you into the unfair assumption that if you're a minority, you come from rough background and if you're not, you've had an easy life.

The people currently benefiting from AA are well off minorities who have lower qualifications but still get into top colleges, and that's just the reality of it.

People really don't have control over their geography, nor their gender. How do you feel about it being easier for asian women to get into MIT than asian males? Or an asian american from Alabama having an easier time than one from MA?

As for not taking into account background with race, you're wrong:

&gt;The university gave OCR specific examples of Asian-American applicants for the Class of 2010 whose grades and SAT scores were not near the top of the range usually seen by the universitys admissions officers, but who nonetheless were offered admission. These included an Asian-American applicant who had 'only' a 3.45 GPA in high school, but who was a nationally recognized athlete; and two other Asian-American applicants with relatively low GPAs and SAT scores who were notable for other distinctions such as community service, overcoming impoverished backgrounds and working in a family business.""

I personally know an asian american student (kid of friend of my mom) who grew up in a poorer area of VT working in his mom/pop's restaurant who got into Harvard (though not a lot of the other Ivies) despite a 2090 on the SAT and not really having a standout app.

I also know an asian american student (personal friend) who had a pretty underwhelming app but was president of the class and of other government clubs, and is at Harvard.

Qualifications is also another ball game that can be a large discussion. Michael Wang was actually previously discussed in this sub, including from people who actually knew him and went to his school.

That's my point....I don't agree that gender and geography should play a factor either in determining admissions. If you're qualified to get in, then you should. It's unfair for something you have no control over to hinder you in any way.

Two of your anecdotal experiences don't make up for the thousands of qualified Asians that don't get accepted. 

Yes perhaps Princeton took that one Asian's student's case into account, but by no means is this a general trend or the norm. The difference this, this specific applicant more than likely had to explain his background and circumstances through one of this essays (when he could have potentially written about something else) whereas a minority would have received the same treatment by merely filling in a bubble, regardless of whether the student was really impoverished or not.  How is it fair that black applicant whose family makes $100,000/yr is given the same preferential treatment as another black applicant whose family makes $20,000 year?

Michael Wang is a small piece of a bigger pie that Asian students face across the country. An Asian applicant with a 2350 SAT is considered at equal to Black applicant with a 1900. I don't know how you can sit there and tell me that asians are treated the same way as black applicants, because honestly that's just ridiculous.

Yes, the model minority stereotype is harmful and must be eliminated, but for me and a lot of the Asian students I knew, we kind of believed it, and I think it had a real effect on our performance.

A comparison can be easily made with East Asian civilizations. Certainly, many of us have suffered under the hands of foreign rule. China suffered immensely under unequal concessions, colonization of Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Opium Wars, the coercion of Coolie labor, the invasions from Japan, the severe loss of life in WW2, etc. One could argue that modern capitalism's agreement with China also produces a large amount of suffering - exploited labor, the laogai system which has half the world's modern slaves and produces trinkets and common goods for Western Markets, 14 hr days 365 days a year with hard manual labor which take tools of labor that has no right to unionize, and all of this performed in a country with weak environmental protection laws (where Western companies can dictate the cost of say textile production without an responsibility for dye leakage into water sources that result in sky rocketing cancer rates). These processes both recent and modern relate to Western markets and their exploitations of vulnerable peoples, but... when Sun Yat Sen, Mao, Deng, and the senior leadership of the Communist party looked at **why our country was failing** they didn't simply point their fingers at the West. 

The difference is that some people like a model that is punitive, retrospective, and finger pointing. Other groups, often more successful, tend to emphasize a continuous effort of improvement that is prospective in nature, constantly analyzes data, encourages a just culture, dissuades a punitive culture, tests new methods to solve old problems, analyzes the results, and focuses on systematic failures with logical methods at addressing them.

""Admission Preferences for Minority Students, Athletes, and Legacies at Elite Universities,"" T.J. Espenshade, C.Y. Chung, and J.L. Walling, Social Science Quarterly, December 2004, 85(5):1422-1446. 

- Allegations of discriminatory admission policies against Asian-American applicants at elite universities led to compliance reviews by the Department of Educations Office for Civil Rights in the late 1980s at Harvard and the University of CaliforniaBerk- eley (U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 1992). Rising proportions of Asian Americans in applicant pools were not fully reflected in the composition of admitted students, and there were concerns that Asian Americans were being squeezed out by preferences for African-American and Hispanic applicants,

- By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission on the order of 17 or 18 percentin relation to comparable whites.

- Average scores for applicants in each race/ethnic group are as follows: white (1347), African American (1202), Hispanic (1230), Asian (1363), and other races (1322). ... The Asian disadvantage also strengthens when controlling for SAT score, because Asian students as a group have the highest average scores.

- The odds of being accepted if one is in the top SAT category are 200 times as great as those for candidates from the bottom SAT group. African-American applicants receive the largest race/ ethnic preference (by a factor of 5.5 over whites) followed by Hispanics. Asians experience the greatest disadvantage in admissions vis-a`-vis other comparable racial/ethnic groups, including those of other races. The odds of admission for Asians are nearly 30 percent lower than those of their white counterparts.

Firstly, i'm going to have to familiarize myself with the spreads of SAT scores before i draw a judgement from this. Also, my impression before doing that legwork is that the asian and white numbers aren't that far apart. 

Secondly, I don't think the af. american or hispanic numbers are quite as telling. If they're admitted at low levels to begin with, the relative boosting of their applications (and depressing of their scores) could translate to limited effect on asian and white admissions. For instance, those scores might reflect doubling the african american enrollment numbers, but correspond to affecting asian and white applicants by, say, a negative 5%. That's a huge boost for a minimal disadvantage. That's a made up number, but i've done the math for med school applicants before, and the boosting of af americans (i forget by what spread) meant a flat decrease of 5% acceptance for all whites and asians. The negative 5% imposed upon over-represented races paled in comparison to, for instance, raising an applicant's GPA by 0.2. It's important to be able to tease out this data for a more level headed discussion.

Last point: ron unz did an article a long time ago and noted that white anglo saxon protestants (non jew white) enrollment was down similar to asian americans. I hate to possibly find myself in the company of /r/conspiracy members, but i remember the only non-affected group were jews. In other words, WASPs were more disadvantaged than the, ""white,"" label would suggest before disaggregation. I remember the disadvantage not being as severe as for asians. But I haven't read [the article](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/) in a few years. I hope to do so this weekend. I'll correct my comment if when i find out which parts of my memory failed me. 

&gt;The odds of admission for Asians are nearly 30 percent lower than those of their white counterparts.

That's damning. But again, i do wish to see how we do in comparison to WASPs as opposed to a monolith, ""whites."" 

As for the article you posted: it focused too heavily on individual portraits (FOR ME), but i won't lie that they were compelling in their own ways. I would very much like to see a more ron unz styled rebuttal to affirmative action, but that's just my egg headedness.

America may become minority-majority country soon, but 60% of college admissions is reasonable considering whites are 50% of the population. You can't argue against that, and then turn around and argue that people shouldn't look into Asian acceptance rates of 20% despite being 5% of the population. 

To me, the question of AA is very simple. It's a brutal moral choice. 

Do we Asian Americans choose to sacrifice, even if unfairly, to promote a more diverse and less racially stratified America.

Or do we look after our own, and shoot for an America that's majority White and Asian in the elite universities, and eventually centers of power and wealth. Effectively shutting out blacks and latinos. 

Don't dance around the issue. Don't do the ""Gee, it's not a zero-sum game"" BS. Look at Harvard, as it is, with its soft quota, and look at Stuyversant that's 90% Asian and a dozen black and latinos kids.

But let's be honest here: Affirmative Action, as it's constructed today, negatively affects Asian-Americans and we shouldn't be told to ""check our privilege"" when we say it does.

Granted, Asian-Americans are more likely to live in some kind of financial comfort when compared to African-Americans or Latinx-Americans. But it doesn't change the fact that Asian-Americans are often imposed with higher expectations or examined with greater scrutiny during the admissions process, even more so than white applicants.

Rather than making Affirmative Action a game of color, why not make it a system of prioritizing needs? Overall, to me, the Affirmative Action debate seems to be a distraction from the issues that would actually help disadvantaged people of color, whether they're black, Latinx, Asian, etc. I seriously wonder why there isn't more discussion on improving K-12 education for disadvantaged children or a bigger emphasis on fighting poverty.

&gt;**Myth #1: Affirmative action discriminates against Asians.**

&gt;Asians aren't victims of affirmative action programs. Studies have shown that AAPIs are harmed by ""negative action,"" which is not the same as affirmative action. Negative action is when AAPIs are held to a higher standard than Caucasians, without any legitimate reason.

What does the author think causes ""negative action""? It's simple math. If you add, artificially, to column A, you have to remove, artificially, from column B. And how do you do this? By holding column B to a higher standard.

&gt;Opponents of affirmative action ignore history when they claim that Asians have been harmed by affirmative action in higher education.

I'm not sure anyone says this. The question is whether it harms Asians *now* - not in the 60s or 70s. I'm not sure that any argument against affirmative action is based on harm to Asians half a century ago.

&gt;Opponents of affirmative action also argue that considering race compromises merit. But merit comes in many forms and grades and test scores aren't everything.

Race, on the other hand, is all about merit.

&gt;**Myth #2: Affirmative action doesn't benefit Asian Americans.**

&gt;AAPIs and all students benefit from being educated in diverse learning environments, which affirmative action programs help create. AAPIs are harmed when they attend schools that are less racially diverse and more segregated.

*...how?* This is so unbelievably paternalistic. ""What you want is not important. You *need* diversity, and we need to look out for *your* best interests by providing you with that diversity.

&gt;**Myth #3: We live in a colorblind society and no longer need affirmative action.**

Said no one (of any relevance) ever.

&gt;**Myth #4: Affirmative action helped Asian Americans in the past, but now Asian Americans don't need it.**

She then proceeds to concur with this ""myth,"" instead offering that we cannot ""only support programs when they benefit us."" I happen to agree. However, even if Asian Americans still ""need[ed]"" affirmative action, the simple fact of the matter is that affirmative action, in its present incarnation, discriminates *against* Asian Americans, so the argument is moot.

&gt;**Myth #5: Asians support the end of affirmative action.**

I think it goes both ways. Asians are individuals, not some sort of monolith that supports one thing or another.

&gt;**So Asians, please don't hate on affirmative action. It does our society good!**

I think so too! But that was not the premise of the article at all! Don't argue that affirmative action (1) does not harm and (2) in fact helps Asians out of one side of your mouth, and then proceed to argue out of the other side of your mouth that although affirmative action (1) harms and (2) does not help Asians, it does society as a whole more good than harm. I agree with the latter argument. However, I just lose it when people try to argue it both ways, as here. It's intellectually dishonest, and intellectually lacking.

It really depends on what program you're looking at. In the most recent case, [Fisher v. UT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas), the Court dealt w/ a system that didn't consider Asian Americans as a minority race. This is, as I believe, due to the fact of racial balancing, i.e., looking at the race of Asian Americans in the school and matching that w/ the population of Asian Americans in Texas. (Note: This is my belief, but the Court has said that racial balancing may be unconstitutional. [See Parents Involved](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_908)). That being said, one of the requirements the Court has stated is that there needs to be reviews of whether or not to implement Affirmative Action programs. I believe in the UT case it was five years. So where am I going at with this? Asian American may not benefit from Affirmative Action in the UT case, but I'm sure at other schools where there are few Asian Americans, affirmative action actually helps them. Again, it depends on which program you look at.

In it you can see we're way closer to whites than the 80K-60K ratio that gets seen in the medians. I WOULD be interested in the income inequality matter.   


I found this pew research page: [https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/)  


So let's analyze this. We have a [graph](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/psdt-07-12_economic_inequality-00-00/) that clearly shows how drastic the difference between bottom 10% and top 10% adults have become since 1970. I find this line in the written portion especially true ""Researchers have also linked growing inequality to greater geographic segregation by income. In addition, there is evidence that rising inequality may harm overall economic growth by reducing consumption levels, causing excessive borrowing by lower- to middle-income families, or limiting investment in education."" but regardless.  


""The income gap between Americans at the top and the bottom of the income distribution widened 27% from 1970 to 2016."", and you can actually see that all races are becoming more unequal in the US, but the rate at which Asians are progressing towards inequality is exceptional and dangerous based on the previous graph.  


I do think, however, that it's important to note that black income inequality is the second highest on this graph. So despite the Asian income median being the highest, and the Black income median being the lowest, both races seem to share this amount of income inequality in 2019. We need to have an answer as to why.  


That's where [graph 3](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/psdt-07-12_economic_inequality-00-02/) comes into play. Clearly, Affirmative Action has stunted lower income Asian-American growth, probably. Because as you can see, black Americans have had increased incomes almost equally. Hispanic people, sort of, but a lot of that has to do with new foreign-born working class Hispanic people coming to live in the US all the time. I don't have a graph to back me up, but I can imagine 1st generation kids have seen almost equal increases like blacks under AA. White people are NOT the same case, however, since not that many Europeans come here. White increase is still, in a way, expected, since the median and lower 10% is still more than the Hispanic counterparts. The upper percent is quite interesting though. But for Asians, the difference is obvious. Now, more Chinese and Indian people come to the US than ever, specifically. [Graph 2](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/psdt-07-12_economic_inequality-00-01/) actually shows that 78% of Asian-Americans are foreign born, which is crazy to me. Again, I want to address brain drain, as I'm not sure how much of this inequality is caused by it, vs AA. So many engineers and doctors come from those countries to work here, my parents included. I'm actually a foreign-born as well, though we came here when I was 2.   


Everything above leads into [graph 4](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/07/12/income-inequality-in-the-u-s-is-rising-most-rapidly-among-asians/psdt-07-12_economic_inequality-00-03/).   


Despite income inequality, Asians still have it best until the bottom 10%, and even then it's still better relative to poor blacks and Hispanics. For me, this supports my argument, because it's showing that this income inequality has to do a lot with the massive increase of the top 10-20% than it has to do with changes in the middle or bottom. Graph 3 supports this too.  


I believe the TRUE solution of AA reform is the idea that any salary below $40,000 shouldn't even consider AA, since everyone in the working class is just trying to survive regardless of race. It's in institutions of privilege that race starts to matter, because rich parents make rich kids rich adults. Same for the middle class (70K a year). Legacy admissions should also probably go.","4_1"

It's the most random fucking collection of hot takes but I appreciate that there's not enough people in any camp for circlejerks to happen. 

Me personally I see it as a failed program since in practice it mostly benefits white women in STEM anyways and doesn't really address the root causes of racism in education. If you want to get more Black and Latino applicants you have to start with K-12 education and the ways that racism impacts that (redlining, property taxes funding schools, violence from cops in school, etc.). These rich white people can talk all day about ~educating the whole student~ or being holistic but won't look at education as a process that encompasses a kid's whole life, not just the moment their application gets to the office. 

And of course, the entire holistic admissions process (not just AA!) was created so Ivy League schools would have a plausible reason to keep Jewish students out, so it's bigoted bullshit all the way down.

For example, he explains the Chinese background but then disrespects it by asking for chill where none is warranted (yet). All immigrants give up a lot in pursuit of the American Dream, and one of the established yellow brick roads is to get your children into elite universities at all cost, and regardless of the collective effect on the Race-Education meta. In negotiation you look past positions and focus on interests. It is here that the writer makes a good point: immigrants have an interest in ensuring their childrens' success, and a society that is less fixated on winners in limited lifepaths (""You must become a doctor, Lee, just like our neighbors's son"") would probably be a happier one.

As Exhibit A, I point to China/Japan/Korea's brutal college exam culture, as well as the overriding drive to get into chaebols like Samsung. In a way, immigrant families still take that impulse to the US, and break a very specific curve. This competitive pressure squeezes diversity out of a system. This is true not just in education but also in gaming: there's a reason why an oppressive, evolving Meta exists in competitive arenas, and why a toxic culture coexists with it. Defy LoL or Overwatch's meta at your peril.

Strangely enough, for all these points, his call to action is not appropriate. For one thing, most people think about their livelihood and their family.

1. Race intersects with economic class, and poorer students are starting from disadvantaged positions.  
2. Diversity is important in education.

But despite agreeing with both points, I still think there is a conflict here. If we're interested in giving poorer students better opportunities, why must we use race as the metric? Why not use a socioeconomic affirmative action system? We have a student's FAFSA, we know their household income, their school district, the neighborhood they grew up in. There are plenty of deserving students from poor white and Asian communities too, and a socioeconomic based system would account for class regardless of race.

At this point, proponents often bring up diversity. I too wouldn't want to attend a school that lacks diversity. But if we value diversity, can't the same argument be made for sports leagues? For corporate leadership? Media and television? Why do we only apply this race-based affirmative action to college admissions? Plus, I can also ask why do we focus so much on *racial* diversity; why don't we place an equal amount of emphasis on a diversity of political opinions, for instance.

In short, it seems to me like the justification for race-based college admissions is disingenuous. I personally think that a socioeconomic based system would be far better, and wouldn't negatively impact diversity on campuses. My view is of course not set in stone, I'm more than willing to hear counterarguments but to date I haven't heard a very convincing one.

Uh, where have you been? People have been pushing for more diversity in media and corporate leadership for years. And there is some level of affirmative action in corporations as well (and asians are included in many of these as well).

It's up to the institutions to implement these - but universities have sought to do this in particular because it's where students live for 4 years to learn and grow. It's fundamentally different from other institutions you listed. It's also related to point 1, and the roles of top universities in shaping leaders.

But I also believe that race is definitely a factor that can't be left out if compared to the other factors you listed such as socioeconomic status and political opinions, because those can change even though it may seem impossible. Race is something we can't change even if we subscribe to another culture (Twinkies, weebs, oreos) and as POC we know that racial discrimination does exist. That's why I believe affirmative action is necessary to prevent exclusion of people who could be discriminated against. Maybe it's less of a thing to worry about now, but back in the day I guarantee it'd be necessary. 

Also as someone mentioned, demands in diversity in other industries such as media are being called for more and more. I agree with more diversity in everything especially in a place where you go specifically to learn. College was all about connections for me so having a way to access a diverse pool of cultures through connections is a great way to become a more worldly and well rounded individual.","1_2"

The color of a person's skin is not the be-all end-all of a person's identity. People are shaped by their culture, their experiences. It is true that some experiences are linked to skin color, and that many people who share a certain race have similar culture and experiences, but I don't think that this justifies claiming that race, on its face, creates and fosters diversity. Take a look at this thread, I assume we are all at least part Asian and put Asian down on our college entrance forms, but we have such different backgrounds. We are scattered all over the country, speak different languages, enjoy different things. I'm sure we all have things in common, like suffering from racism or other discrimination, but I don't think that that is how any of us define ourselves. To me, current affirmative action minimizes the individual in favor of the race as a whole, and that is not how education should work.

One of the issues with affirmative action is that it is always a band-aid solution for a problem within a Neoliberal labour market or poor public policies relating to education. It is clear that, in the US context, that the school system is broken from a patch-work of private, charter, public schools that are dependent on municipal funds rather than Federal/State level funding, unlike Canada. This directly impacts on the quality of education and reduces vulnerable groups to apply to high ranking schools. This is correlated to several Asian groups, although generally Indian/Chinese/Korean/Japanese continue to be over-represented.

Asian American groups that are over represented doesn't mean they are more qualified. Many people, of any race, are qualified but rejected.

Pinker raises a few interesting points about the perceived uselessness of making evaluations for college admissions on the basis of participation in extracurricular activities, legacy status, and other non-academic ""qualifications,"" but I think that he fails to take into consideration the sheer numbers game aspect of it all. If you just make Ivy League admissions solely about standardized testing scores, then this would obligate university officials to accept every student who manages to reach the 2240-2400 SAT range; although these kinds of scores aren't widespread among the general group of test-takers, thousands of students every year receive these sorts of evaluations (and the 8 Ivy League schools could hardly afford to give every kid with high percentile scores a spot in their next freshman classes). Plus, are we really going to argue that a hypothetical poor student with a 2250 on the SAT and a 4.0 GPA didn't strive significantly harder to perform well academically than a hypothetical wealthy student with the same stats? Would we also make the case that a student with a 2300 and no extracurriculars is explicitly ""better"" than a student with a 2270 who participated in a sports team and logged hundreds of hours volunteering for a homeless shelter? It is perfectly all right to make the claim that certain aspects of college admissions are in need of retooling, but Pinker's ideas represent a radical adjustment to the status quo that doesn't provide a fair evaluation for all applicants.

No matter how smart, or how noble their intentions, it's ultimately human beings that are making these decisions, and we are fallible.  We're not superior arbiters of fairness when compared to objective methods.

This is why what Mayor Bloomberg did for NYC high schools was so noble in battling against holistic admissions.  He recognized that the kids getting into the elite schools were often poor immigrants who would never have that opportunity with holistic admissions.  They can't afford extracurriculars in every sense of monetary cost, free time, and knowledge of how to game the system.  These are things insiders and rich people can do when you have affirmative action or holistic admissions.  The upper class parents can now utilize unfair advantages in grooming their child for advantages that poorer parents are unaware and incapable of.

Also, the difference between 2100 and 2400 is pretty drastic.  [Harvard's 25th percentile has SAT scores of 2120](http://collegeapps.about.com/od/collegeprofiles/p/harvard_profile.htm), meaning at least 1/4 of their class is not even close to being that exceptional.

http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/SAT-Percentile-Ranks-2013.pdf

Look at those percentiles.  A 2100 score is barely in the top 5%.  A 2300 score is around the top 1%.  Harvard, along with many other ""elite"" schools accept students that simply will not be able to maximize the opportunities afforded to them.  

The difference between a mind on the order of 1 of 20 and 1 of 100 is enormous, when extrapolated throughout a student body, in terms of their ultimate potential to contribute to society.  The Ivy League has too few minds in the top 0.n% and too many minds in the top 3%.  The difference is noticeable at that level.  

To simplify, if we section off that group of the top 3%, it would be like rejecting the most objectively qualified of 10-30 students, in order to accept the worst ranked one.  To say the objectively worst student out of 10-30 has the extracurriculars to overcome the best kid is nonsensical.  We're really just accepting students based on the biases of people in charge of admissions.  Whenever I hear an elite school rejecting a 2300 SAT score, I'm reminded of how idiotic this process is.","3_2"

You say that a person with a 2120 ""won't be able to maximize the opportunities afforded to them,"" even though this level of performance should be sufficient enough to graduate from pretty much any university (and qualify for post-graduate training). I'm not saying that we should admit more students with scores in the 2100s to elite universities, but on the same token, it's not as if we've got an epidemic of Harvard drop-outs. For schools such as Caltech and MIT, I can understand why there might be more stringent requirements for intelligence (as an example, Caltech heavily frowns upon any SAT I math score below 760.) In the fields of engineering and hard science research, it makes sense to exclusively recruit the ""cream of the crop"" and choose students by intelligence only; however, for everything else, this approach is highly illogical. The vast majority of students at Ivy League universities major in the liberal arts fields or in the social sciences, and the average person attempting to obtain a BA in psychology hardly needs a 97th percentile IQ to complete their degree (no offense to psychology majors intended). By pursuing your suggested course of action, the Ivy admissions process will be converted into even more of a crapshoot than it already is, and you'd quickly end up placing too much focus on qualities such as technical proficiency and raw intelligence. People with 2300 SAT scores would still be rejected from Harvard under this new scheme, and there still wouldn't be enough space for every high-scoring student; also, it would become harder to differentiate one high-scoring student from another if you couldn't use any other determining factor to assist the comparison. Diversity would suffer as well, and most URMs would be pushed out altogether. This seems like a bleak future for higher education in America, and it just isn't something that the vast majority of people would put their support behind.

A better plan would be to simply retool AA to work *primarily* on the basis of average annual income rather than race, destroy legacy admissions, and expand ""impacted"" major requirements (i.e. make it so only the highest scoring students can go into the most competitive/difficult fields of study).

* What exactly is this relationship of high test scores to intellectual elitism/snobbery?
* What is the ceiling of someone's ability to contribute to post-graduate studies with a 2120 SAT score vs a 2300 score?  For example, could they get a philosophy PhD from Harvard?  My guess is usually not for the former, while possibly for the latter.
* Is graduation the bar we're setting when defending the 97th percentile students?
* Are 800 math scores worthless in non-STEM fields?  If not, then what are they worth?
* Shouldn't elite liberal arts schools have elite standards for critical reading or the writing portion, a la MIT for SAT Math?
* Is technical proficiency or raw intelligence mutually exclusive from other cognitive abilities with are apparently useful for liberal arts?
* What cognitive traits do these 2100 SAT score students have that 2300 SAT score students are missing?
* How many 2300 SAT scores do you believe are out there?
* How big is the student body of these elite schools?

I'd suggest searching for the studies that examined the elite scores of 7th grade SAT student takers, and see how their lives turned out.  SAT scores have been overwhelmingly good indicators of future contributors.

Anyways, I doubt people will be convinced by logic or evidence, because we are irrational.  As immigration continues and the population grows, the absurdity of this policy will become more evident, as it has started to become a recognized issue.

No study of IQ heritability and not even the most ardent of IQ fundamentalists have ever put the heritability of IQ at 100%.

Not everyone will understand the test materials.  That's your faulty assumption.  Most poor people taking the SAT will remain in the same position you were in before you artificially boosted your scores via test prep.  They will also not have the social pressure to prep for it like wealthier people will.  And they will have less (no) time to study.  



&gt;and that IQ itself is mostly genetic in nature

Well, the Flynn Effect and the diminished Black-White IQ gap between the 1950's-1980's might like to get a word in there, for starters.

But discussions of IQ are immaterial if we can agree that SAT scores can be decoupled from IQ in some situations.

Your SAT math score, for instance, would be about 2 standard deviations higher than what it would be expected if you had been poor and unable to study (assuming that your initial math score was around 500 and your post-study one was around 700).  

Studying for the SAT math section made your performance IQ appear to be about 2 standard deviations higher than that of ""poor you"" in the eyes of college admissions officers.  On a Weschler IQ test, where a standard deviation is 15 points and with the average SAT taker having a slightly above average IQ, that would be a difference in PIQ between roughly 103 and 133.

Those thirty IQ points are the difference between ""just above normal"" and ""just in Mensa"".

Do you think that your Performance IQ is Mensa worthy?  Well, your college does.

&gt;I don't disagree with any of this, really.

Then I'd hope that we can agree that Pinker's prescription for an increased reliance on test scores which you know from personal experience to be alterable is an unjust and anti-meritocratic one.

Well, there's this post about SAT prep, and it has a link to the actual study showing that test preparation has marginal effects.  I'm not sure how you refute this data.  Beyond a few practice trials, test preparation is mostly a poor investment of time.  The vast majority of students are better off doing real learning or working.

It's just not common and overall improvement doesn't seem much different than kids who don't prep, since some of them also have much higher scores the next time they take it.  We all have anecdotes.  We can't take anecdotes showing a positive result bias and extrapolate from there what is the likely scenario, when we already have thorough studies with plenty of data showing otherwise.  Solid empiricism trumps conjecture.","4_1_1_2"

The wording of the guarantees basically makes it trivial for them to get out of having to give a refund if they just claim that the student did something wrong.

Moreover, most people *can* improve their scores through being familiar with whatever tests they are taking, though scores plateau after that point.  If you go in to a test having no idea what is covered, then you waste a lot of time reading and internalizing directions, and that could cost you quite a bit.  That's a one-time fix, though, and test prep courses are usually a $2000 solution to a problem that can be solved with a $10 book and an afternoon of studying.

Edit: There are sometimes a few tricks you can learn about tests, too, but I'm not sure if those really help much (and getting a book still beats dropping two grand on a class).  I'm also not sure if the studies on this take into account the fact that most test prep is pretty much garbage.

I still expect the rich to have better test scores, of course, since standardized tests are easier to take if you have a decent education, and rich people almost always have access to better education.","4_1_1_2_1"

Sure, i'd agree that test prep companies are generally not very good.  But data points belying theories also need to be taken into account when theorizing.  I didn't study for the SATs so I can't comment on those, but I did take a Kaplan LSAT class and felt like I got very little out of it.  My LSAT score didn't appreciably increase after our class ended.  It was a waste of money, and the conventional wisdom amongst people serious about studying for the LSAT is that you shouldn't waste your time with professional prep companies.  However, studying on my own for several months did improve my LSAT scores and I'm not the only person who has had this experience.  I wouldn't be surprised if generally speaking classes for SAT prep (and GRE prep and LSAT prep ) are a waste of money for most people, especially if they simply show up to the class and expect to improve by just passively absorbing the information or if they are there because their parents forced them to go, while a subset of people who are more motivated and who grapple with the material more than others are more likely to experience testing gains.  It's also possible that learning on your own is a more reliable method of increasing your score than sitting in a class with 30 people and relying on a mass-marketed testing strategy to shoot knowledge into your head.

Saying that professional testing companies don't on the whole improve their students' scores (which I'd agree with) doesn't demonstrate that students cannot generally improve their scores on  standardized tests through study; it just shows that these companies are not the best at mass-producing means of teaching their students how to appreciably improve their scores on these tests.  It also doesn't take into account the psychological motivation of the student (I'd also bet that there are individual variances as to how reactive students are to individualized or group study, but these would probably even out when you look at millions of people).


This would also explain the paradoxical discrepancy between the modest overall test-prep gains that you linked to (and that people like Pinker and Charles Murray always cite) and individual examples of people who belie these data, either as outliers in their prep classes or by studying on their own.

The problem is that if you want to do what I did on the LSAT you need resources, both the money to buy prep books and the ability to set aside numerous hours to study.  Not everyone possesses these resources in equal abundance.

TL;DR: Your link doesn't show that test prep doesn't help, it just shows that test prep companies generally don't provide test gains, which I'd agree with.","4_1_1_2_2"

So a poor and rich of equal native ability could have drastically different scores that could lead to drastically different life outcomes.

SAT's don't measure native ability.  Their scores are generally correlated in some way with native ability, but they are not direct measurements.

Yeah... but it's often over looked. Many Asian immigrants don't have an education, but yet their kids are denied due to a flawed affirmative action system. I feel basing affirmative action on race divides Asians and other PoC. It's understandable when a child is turned down because he/she already has it all, but to be turned down due to skin color while being poor and as the parents only hope is very cruel. Many immigrants who were raised on ethics of hardwork also don't understand how affirmative action works and they end up being disappointed in their child who should have gotten in. To be hit on both sides mentally as a child with your family living close to poverty drives many Asian children into depression and even suicide. It's sad and it's why I would fight to change affirmative action, but not to abolish it. They need to stop basing it on race.","1_3_1"

The whole idea of ""holistic"" admissions is not wrong. Schools tries to build communities; they need english majors, whole orchestras, engineers, athletes, etc. You can argue they don't, but as they currently are, that's what they want. Part of the prestige of elite schools is that their students go on to be the best in so many fields, from STEM to arts to athletics to the humanities. And having diversity makes a school richer in terms of what kinds of student groups are around and who you meet.

Our parents constantly push us towards the same thing, which only makes the competition worse.

It's not about being more or less fair, but a failure to realize that college admission in the US is a bit different than it is in other countries. Also, that's not to mention that private schools will have different admission criteria than public schools.","1_3_1_3"

 Sorry, but I'm not following. Is not the whole point of this thread to discuss the fairness of the US system? Yeah, the system varies from country to country, but why does that matter? What's the point of realizing that? We want to make the US system to be more fair, irrelevant of what other countries do.","1_3_1_3_1"

Where they come from that might be the case, but it's not the case in the USA. They sometimes get upset and call it unfair, but it's not unfair, it's just a different system for evaluation. 

I think admissions comes down to two parts that are sometimes at tension

1. How does a university attract and admit qualified or excellent students?

2.  How does a university cultivate a positive and diverse student body?

Parents only think about the first part without thinking about second. That's where things like certain ECs, civic engagement, diversity, and even essay writing come into play. Additionally GPAs are not standard. Between schools that do weighted GPA's (some schools give students 5.3's on A+ on a 4.0 scale if it's an AP class) and unweighted GPAs, to schools with gross grade inflation (weak schools with many 4.0 students vs. more challenging and rigorous schools that have no 4.0 students), or even schools that don't give letter grades and only do evaluations through narratives, there is a lot of things to consider in admissions. In the USA there are so many types of institutions at both the secondary and university level. And there is a lack lack of standards in evaluations across the country (which is fine in my opinion). Admissions isn't just about the GPA and SAT. Asian families need to realize that. And they also realize that part of what makes a good institution is a diverse population; there's civic value having students learn amongst peers that have differing backgrounds than there own.

So when the Asian Community tends to get upset about admission, I get pissed off because they only look at in terms of 1, but not 2. Also, the community is too fixated on just the Ivy's and hyper competitive schools.","1_3_1_3_1_1"

Part of the issue is asian parents force kids into the same sorts of activities, increasing the competition even further. Because a school only needs so many violinists and STEM majors.

At least part of supposed anti-asian aspect of holistic reviews is to blame on stupid views of how admissions work and forcing kids to do stupid things.

He's saying the issue is that Asian kids raised in environments stressing academic excellence do not always have parents that stress diverse or civic extra-curriculars. Cursory involvment in Key Club or National Honors Society pales in comparison to the kid that volunteers as a Best Buddy (peer friendship group for students with mental disabilities), works as a peer advocate for planned parenthood, or something else like that which is very substantive and speaks to concrete civic engagement.

AA as it is implemented now, however, is absolute bull-shit and tremendously Anti-Asian. I don't know if this country can ever implement a ""fair"" race-based Affirmative Action but what we have right now is disgusting.


The OP says
&gt;""Affirmative action does not exclude or limit the admission of students from any specific racial or ethnic background. ""

This is an absolute lie and I cannot believe groups that pretend to ""represent us"" can be so ignorant or stupid. 

An actual academic [study] (https://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20Admission%20Preferences%20Espenshade%20Chung%20June%202005.pdf) on race-based Affirmative Action shows that 

&gt;Our results show that removing consideration of race would have a minimal effect on white applicants to elite universities. The number of accepted white students would increase by 2.4 percent, and the white acceptance rate would rise by just 0.5 percentage pointsfrom 23.8 to 24.3 percent.

White applicants, the most privileged group in the entire country are not negatively impacted by this policy. They have the greatest advantage on an unequal playing field and yet they are not ""punished."" Who is?


&gt;Asian applicants are the biggest winners if race is no longer considered in admissions. Nearly four out of every five places in the admitted class not taken by African-American and Hispanic students would be filled by Asians. We noted earlier that Asian candidates are at a disadvantage in admission compared to their white, African-American, and Hispanic counterparts. Removing this disadvantage at the same time preferences for African Americans and Hispanics are eliminated results in a significant gain in the acceptance rate for Asian studentsfrom 17.6 percent to 23.4 percent.


Asians. Instead of tackling the problem of white privilege in university admissions the white and Jewish administrators of elite colleges are taking spots from Asians and giving them to blacks and hispanics. Whites have the greatest advantage in this white-dominated society and yet they are protected from AA policies by white and Jewish administrators. 


And these fucking Uncle Tongs of the ""AAPI community"" try and cut out the legs from under Asian American applicants who are already disadvantaged in admissions. 



From the OP:
&gt;Affirmative action simply takes into account whether an applicant has overcome significant obstacles and institutional barriers, such as racial and ethnic discrimination



AND WE DO NOT FACE ANY FUCKING RACIAL OR ETHNIC DISCRIMINATION!???



EDIT: The study is by a prominent Princeton sociologist who you would expect would be BIASED AGAINST pro-Asian arguments because his institution actively participates in these Anti-Asian affirmative action policies. And yet he presents these results with quite clear conclusions.","1"

&gt;dominance and assertiveness at work from Asian males is PUNISHED.  [Rotman study] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22506817)

&gt;Summary - there is a difference between ""descriptive"" and ""prescriptive"" stereotypes. Descriptive stereotypes are what people believe to be true about members of a particular group, while prescriptive stereotypes are how people WANT members of a particular group to behave.

&gt;The paper incorporates a series of studies. The first showed that most participants held descriptive stereotypes of Asians as cold, competent, and non-dominant (typical weak Asian nerd stereotype).

&gt;The second study showed that THE MOST VALUED EXPECTATION of East Asians was that they STAY IN THEIR PLACE and don't take on any dominant roles.

&gt;Most importantly, the study also found that East Asians who exhibited dominance and warmth at work REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF RACE BASED HARASSMENT than other workers. Those that ""stayed in their place"" did not encounter the same workplace hostility.

&gt;What's worse - the study's East Asian participants also seemed to hold the same limiting beliefs about other East Asians. In other words, THEY DO NOT LIKE DOMINANT EAST ASIANS EITHER and participate in social coercion to ensure East Asians ""stay in their place"". Everybody buys into stereotypes to some extent, even the group being stereotyped - Uncle Chongs are real.

&gt;It's really a catch 22. They don't promote you to leadership positions because they say you lack ""assertiveness"" but if you demonstrate assertiveness, they retaliate against you and you still don't get ahead. Meanwhile, the same assertive behavior from your white coworkers is characterized as leadership.

Nobody on this subreddit can deny that the issue of SCA 5 was something worthy of discussion this past couple of months.

*Therefore, do you really think it is that unreasonable for a subreddit posting to cite that as context of interest?*

The SCA 5 photos depicted Yee in a political leadership role. If you search back in this very subreddit you'll find comments that think of Yee as being in a position of leadership. So whatever your real point is here, you're exhibiting a kind of  cognitive dissonance that's not very insightful to other people.

I have a different theory as to what's going on here. I think you're reacting to this particular pairing of information because you're afraid to examine the possibility that an anti-SCA 5 view is consistent with whatever enables a person to engage in political corruption. You're trying to suppress the very questioning of this. And that is dangerous.

Editorializing would be if I had that same title except had: ""(Sen. Yee was responsible for undermining progress in affirmative action). That's editorializing. And that's not what I did, for fairly deep reasons. Your accusation doesn't hold water, and I've explained this quite clearly.

Also compounding your perception problem is the fact that the Leland Yee corruption story has already been posted on this subreddit multiple times in the past week, and SCA 5 generated dozens of posts two weeks ago.

There is more than one sense in which a person can be a leader. Senators are political leaders. I don't understand what is so difficult about this.

This is from the The Nation:

*&a grassroots campaign waged by Asian-American groups (predominantly Chinese) and supported by conservative officials successfully ended that push.*

Senator Yee being a government official successfully halting the progress of SCA 5 is entirely consistent with the description above. In political dynamics there are many kinds of leaders; you don't have to be the sole top-down leader from the beginning to be called a *leader*.

I don't know what you're trying to nitpick about here, you seem to be reading too much into a pretty straightforward and truthful description of a public person.","1_3_2_1"

To everyone else in the United States he was also a figurehead, speaking on the issue and getting his photo taken for front-page news articles. He and the other Asian senators are *the* individuals that everyone else read about and saw in the news. It's a little weird that you keep trying to minimize his role.

If you want to invoke some theory of leadership, then:

1) Leaders sometimes step in at the end of a process, because social movements are always ongoing. 

2) People can be subjects of a campaign or movement, as well as instigators furthering the movement. It's not an either/or proposition. People's roles are interconnected.

He withdrew support for SCA 5 *because* he saw enough momentum in a grassroots campaign, e.g. he was eventually convinced by the many families who called on him. These are things that political leaders do continuallythey decide on and adopt stances. He could equally have chosen not to listen and change his mind. It's  their job. To twist this into Yee being a purely passive agent is a strange analysis, bordering on irresponsible.

**summary** Based on the understanding exhibited in mainstream news, Sen. Yee and the other Asian senators were instrumental leaders affecting the course of SCA 5. In recent news Yee has been charged with corruption at the federal level. It remains an open and debatable question how to interpret and evaluate Yee's contributions to the Asian American community, given that his methods may indeed be highly corrupt. It would seem to be a time for reflection on the part of all community members on how things have transpired.

I think it's pretty straightforward. There's no need to make any extreme claims or distortions, and every need to skeptical and open-minded.","1_3_2_2"

Is he really that desperate for $70k? It seems to me to be really small amount of money to go through the risk of trafficing illegal firearms, while being a senator. Seriously, they earn like $174k per year [1](https://www.google.com/search?q=salary+of+senator). 

If he really has connections deep enough to traffic firearms internationally, he is probably a multi-millionaire. Why would he do something like this for a bribe of several tens of thousand dollars? Also, can you really traffic firearms that cheap, lol?

I think all the articles on prop 16 are being really disingenuous because they purposely fail to acknowledge exactly what you said. It's possible to implement a policy that uplifts other minorities while also not holding Asians to a higher standard than whites who don't have to go through the systemic racism we do. But they completely ignore this aspect and portray the issue as either you're for Harvard style discrimination or you're completely against helping bipoc. It's like they want people who have very real concerns (for legitimate reasons because the wording is really vague and confusing) to just shut up and accept being a sacrificial lamb (while whites get held to a lower standard than asians for no justifiable reason) for the ""greater good."" So of course people are gonna be pissed because they feel like they're not being listened to! 

So if Prop 16 wanted asians to support it, maybe they should've had people come out and explicitly state what safeguards they're implementing so it doesn't become yet another Harvard-esque style of discrimination based on pErSoNaLiTy scores, but at the Cal state and UC level which many people actually depend on unlike Harvard. Instead of shrugging, dodging questions, and making everything vague. Most Asians in my experience aren't against AA, they just want things to be fair and not get held to a higher standard than privileged whites ironically in the name of ""equity."" To me all the strawman is really a turnoff.

The case, closing arguments in which [were delivered last month](https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/02/18/critics-and-defenders-affirmative-action-submit-their-closing-briefs), alleges that the university's admissions policies favor black and Latino applicants at the expense of Asian American applicants. While Harvard is the formal defendant, affirmative action -- and selective colleges' use of holistic admissions, among other things -- are also on trial.

**This year's presidents' survey asked a series of questions about the Harvard lawsuit and attendant issues, finding the respondents strongly supportive of affirmative action but nervous about the outcome and potential impact of the case.**

Strong majorities of presidents believe that colleges should continue to consider race and ethnicity alongside other factors in admissions decisions (62 percent) and that **the public does not understand holistic admissions, in which selective institutions judge applicants on the totality of their individual records rather than on a rubric of grades and scores alone (79 percent)**. As seen in the graphic below, support for affirmative action was strongest among leaders of public doctoral and master's/baccalaureate universities and private doctoral and master's institutions, and weakest among community colleges and private baccalaureate colleges. The latter category includes some institutions with selective admissions, but a vast majority are not.

**Just because presidents generally support affirmative action does not mean they are confident that Harvard will successfully defend its practices -- or that Asian Americans don't face discrimination in selective college admissions.**

Barely more than a third of campus leaders, 37 percent, agree or strongly agree with the statement that they ""feel confident in Harvard's defense of itself and the principles behind affirmative action""; 27 percent disagree or strongly disagree, and 35 percent are neutral. Harvard's private university peers (46 percent) and presidents of public doctoral institutions (44 percent) were likeliest to agree.

**Forty-two percent of chief executives -- virtually identical across sectors -- strongly agree or agree that ""Asian American applicants to top colleges face discrimination,"" while fewer than a quarter disagree.**

**Their skepticism about Harvard's chances at trial, however, doesn't mean the institutions are preparing for life without affirmative action.** Barely one in seven presidents, 13 percent, said their institution is ""planning for the possibility that courts may limit or bar the consideration of race in admissions and financial aid,"" with the proportion highest at public doctoral universities, where a quarter of presidents said they were preparing for that possibility.

**The Harvard lawsuit and the possibility that affirmative action could be undermined has brought renewed attention to the issue of admissions preferences for the children of alumni, which some advocates for affirmative action see as a form of favoritism for those who have historically fared best in higher education -- ""a system of inherited privilege that benefits rich whites at the expense of almost everyone else,""** as [Nicholas Kristof put it](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/27/opinion/sunday/legacy-college-admissions-harvard.html) in *The New York Times* last fall.

About half of college presidents (52 percent) said they believe it is appropriate for private colleges to consider legacy status in admissions, although private college leaders (60 percent) and those at public doctoral universities (65 percent) were much likelier than those at community colleges (38 percent) and public four-year colleges (44 percent) to agree.

Only a quarter of campus chief executives, 24 percent, agreed that it was appropriate for public colleges to consider legacy status in admissions.","2"

Is there additional context behind this question? It seems confusingly worded - do Asian Americans face discrimination from society, or from the college admissions boards themselves?

Assuming the latter, it's a pretty damning statement given that the results are consistent across sectors. That means even executives of top colleges agree that they (or at least other schools in their tier) are engaging in discrimination against Asian American applicants. One would wonder if they ran studies confirming this and similarly suppressed results like Harvard did.","2_1"

He also links to [Fang's rebuttal](http://reappropriate.co/?p=6878) to Yang's opposition piece. Fang also links to a number of different surveys and polls to back up her assertions. The comment section is also interesting. 

Finally, I encourage you to [check out the original survey](http://www.naasurvey.com/resources/Home/NAAS-Field-2014-final.pdf), it's only 13 pages and very readable. I was surprised to find that Asian Americans even in the 40+ age range, and those born outside the US, were both strongly in favor of Affirmative Action. Definitely different from what I was led to believe by the noise. Chinese Americans did lead the opposition at 24% (just behind white Americans), at twice the rate of Asian Americans in general (13% opposed), but the politicians didn't need to cave in to the vocal minority about SCA-5. 

I guess the moral of this story is that [Chinese Americans in favor of affirmative action need to speak up louder](http://jasonfongwrites.blogspot.com/2014/06/coming-of-age-or-flash-mob-asian.html) if this ever gets another chance.

&gt;But perhaps the most revealing of the many differences between the two cases is the response of Jews and Asian-Americans to the charge that Harvard was discriminating. **In the 1920s, the Jewish community was virtually unanimous in its denunciation of Harvards policy whereas today, the Asian-American community is** [**divided on the issue.**](http://aapidata.com/blog/asianam-affirmative-action-surveys/) Recognizing that the lawsuit is at bottom an assault on affirmative action, 156 Asian-American organizations [signed a brief](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-01/harvard-admissions-suit-gets-support-from-asian-american-groups) defending Harvards policies.

The Jewish community is much smaller and less diverse than the Asian-American community so of course Asian-Americans are more divided.

&gt;In the end, the Asian-American question is an entirely different matter than whether Harvard and other highly selective universities should end affirmative action for historically underrepresented minorities. **We know from the experience of my own institution, the University of California at Berkeley, what the consequences will be if affirmative action is ended:** **After the passage by California voters of** [**Proposition 209**](https://www.amazon.com/Color-Bind-Californias-Campaign-Affirmative/dp/0520213440/ref=sr_1_1?amp=&amp;dpID=41wbuIXMj4L&amp;dpSrc=srch&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=lydia+chavez&amp;preST=_SY291_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_QL40_&amp;qid=1536274668&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;tag=thehuffingtop-20) **in 1996, black enrollment declined from nearly 10 percent in the mid-1990s to** [**under 3 percent**](https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data) **in recent years.**

**Op-Ed: Im an Asian American Harvard grad. Affirmative action helped me**

The Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments in two cases at the end of the month and could decide the fate of affirmative action in higher education. In 2018, I testified before a federal judge in one of those cases, Students for Fair Admission vs. Harvard, attesting to the importance of affirmative action in my life and why it is valuable to the Asian American community.

I am the daughter of working-class Chinese immigrants who speak very little English. I was born at Chinese Hospital and grew up in Lower Nob Hill in San Francisco. My parents worked at restaurants for low wages, and our family of six barely scraped by. We lived in a cramped one-bedroom apartment among urban professionals and underserved communities.

Before I was even a teenager, I advocated and translated for my family. In my household, my siblings and I are the first generation to graduate from college. In my personal statement for my college application to Harvard, I wrote about how these experiences shaped my passion to do work that would help others with similar struggles.

I began at Harvard in 2015. During my first year, I was miserable and homesick, but I eventually found an academic home in my ethnic studies classes and a broader sense of belonging through campus organizing related to racial justice. At a student activism meeting in 2017, a friend shared how to file requests under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to see my admissions file. Curiosity and a lingering impostor syndrome led me to test out the process.

The registrars office gave me 45 minutes to view my file. My admissions readers saw value and authenticity in my perspective: Categorized as low-income and with Taiwanese-speaking parents, she relates to the plight of the outsiders in Ralph Ellison and William Faulkner. Though my test scores were far from perfect, they believed that I had the potential to make a contribution to college life that would be truly unusual.

I benefited from an admissions process that took race and the effects of racism into consideration. My story cant be conveyed in a race-blind way and during the Harvard trial my admissions file was used as an exhibit to illustrate this. The benefits of affirmative action carried over into my classroom experience as well, where I had the chance to learn from classmates who came from very different backgrounds than my own.

After graduation, I packed my bags and moved back home to that one-bedroom apartment, determined to get to work. By day I worked in multiracial coalitions for policies that could help immigrant working families, such as investment in workforce training for communities of color. At night I continued to navigate complicated systems and programs as a client, applying for affordable housing through Asian American nonprofits and taking my parents to Chinatown outreach sites for COVID-19 vaccines. Doing this work  for myself and for others  gives me hope that someday everyone can share the belief that a more fair and inclusive society is a better one.

The injustices I grew up witnessing and experiencing still permeate our lives. The Supreme Court shouldnt end affirmative action. The U.S. needs more such programs and policies that address the inequities that people face in this country.

Some people point to Asian Americans, the model minority, being well represented at elite universities as a reason race-conscious policies arent necessary in higher education. The plaintiffs in one of the Supreme Court cases accuse Harvard of discriminating against Asian American applicants even though at the lower courts, no evidence of this was found. I am just one of many Asian American students and alumni who believe the universitys race-conscious policies helped our admission and made our education better.

Asian Americans need and benefit from affirmative action. Almost 70% of Asian American voters support affirmative action. And in states such as California, where the program has been banned since 1996, universities have struggled to increase diversity without it.

Affirmative action is successful because it opens doors for people who would otherwise be excluded  and because it recognizes that everyone benefits from having diverse perspectives at the table. The program is an acknowledgment that our education system isnt fair, and laws that help remedy its inequities are necessary. If the Supreme Court ends affirmative action, as many predict, Ill be among its last beneficiaries. And Ill continue working to help those like me, who deserve access to the opportunities a great education can provide, and who will pay that benefit forward when they get it.","3"

[http://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/3kobrh/z/cuz45fh](http://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/3kobrh/z/cuz45fh)

&gt;&gt; 20 percent of Harvards first year students are Asian Americans. Thats four times more than their general population. To argue that Asian Americans are discriminated against seems silly, in my opinion.

&gt; So Asians aren't facing discrimination because they're overrepresented? What? 

&gt; My beef with college admissions is that Asians need to work harder to beat white students. 

&gt; Also, as the article shows, you can still support affirmative action even as an Asian.

&gt;&gt; In May, 135 Asian American organizations came out in support of affirmative action in higher education.

&gt; However, it's just not right when white people make Asians compete with under-represented PoC for admissions. Have the white spots taken away, the group responsible for disenfranchising Black, Latinx, and other people.

The article is about the Harvard case . The Harvard case is only happening Edward Blum tried taking affirmative action to court in Texas with Abigail fisher and failed so he set up the students for fair admissions group to get Asians to help him take AA to court. This fight is not nearly on any level similar to any past civil rights struggle. And you look at how the people who support us in this are conservative whites.when the only glowing write ups about this case are by right of center publications who, all of a sudden care about racial equality when its about Asians v affirmative action.  

So yea no, Im not fucking with some affluent Asian parent who shows up on Fox News distraught his kid has to go to a slightly less prestigious school. We consistently come out for the worst possible issues. Asians are silent on most issues, but oh shit a Chinese cop shot a black dude in nyc. All of a sudden the Chinese community is out en mass to support this dude. 

I disagree that Edward Blum is using Asians as a tool against other races. In a New Yorker article where he is described having a record of fighting to overturn race conscious laws, an asian kid who was mad he didnt get into his college reached out to him first. So yeah, sorry if I dont feel sorry for that fucking kid. 

This fight is not any where comparable to black people having to sit at the back of the bus. We have actually willingly allied with a dude who has devoted his entire life taking down laws that came into effect because of Rosa Parks

I am not sure what to say about having issues with incorrect perceptions of inferiority.  Though I will say that that seems like a lot to attribute to the motivations and actions of white friends.  That seems more of a personal issue to overcome than an imposition from the outside.  Also, I would say it was a universal experience.  Everyone has to fight with those types of emotions in some context or another.

In terms of sexual competition, I think these dynamics play out even in completely homogenous groups.  Again, the inferiority thing still seems like a personal issue to overcome, and which can be overcome.

Hit the gym, get bigger, learn game (/r/trpgame), learn social dynamics.  I don't think injecting a little alpha into a guy's personality is going to lose him his friends (regardless of group diversity).  If anything, I would expect it to earn him respect.

OP, you yourself are drawing the wrong conclusion from this ""study"". 

&gt; An analysis of empirical data indicates there was **no direct causal
relationship between increased Asian American enrollment numbers in the UC and the implementation of race-blind admissions policies in 1998.** 

(emphasis mine). The authors are saying that ending affirmative action *didn't increase* AAPI attendance at the 8 UC's sampled. 

In other words, their assertion is that **ending affirmative action didn't harm AAPI applicants.** That is *absolutely not the same* as saying **""affirmative action benefits Asian Americans"".**

Furthermore,^my^neckbeard^just^grew there's just no way that looking at this one data point can meaningfully answer this question. Just off the top of my head, you'd at the very least have to design controls for the quality of the AAPI cohort in each year (e.g if the AAPI applicants got ""worse"" from 1998-2009, that completely confounds the nonconclusion in this ""study""). 

There's a literally endless amount of externalities that this study completely ignores... Another example: you need to contrast AAPI admittance against other racial groups, because affirmative action didn't just affect AAPI applicants. You need to see how the admittance for all racial groups changed over this same period before drawing any normative conclusions.

OP, assuming you're acting in good faith and not some rando shill, please be more discerning about posts like this in the future. It should have been an **immediate, glaring red flag** to you that this ""study"" is absurdly narrow in the scope of data it uses, especially given the complexity of the question it's trying to answer.

There's also one more source from the same 2014 feminist pop culture blog post that claims ""Yes, you are reading this graph right. Prop 209 resulted in a 30% drop in Black, Chicano, and Native American admission rates in a single year."" 

Just to give you an idea of the quality of the sources your link is citing: That feminist blog post's claim is made on the basis of just one year, 1997-1998, for just one school, UC Berkeley. It shows that black/""chicano"" (literally I have never heard this used to describe a demographic in any academic study, or anywhere not colloquial) /native american admittance dropped by 30% that year. But that is completely within the realm of statistical variance, because those students were being admitted at such low numbers to begin with, which I can infer from the fact that AAPI and white students *in the same period* only saw admittance rise by 2.6% and 2.2% respectively, according to the author's data. So if you assume that UC Berkeley admitted roughly the same amount of students in 1997 as in 1998, it means that (2.6% of the number of white students + 2.2% of AAPI students) = 30% of black/""chicano""/native american students. Going from 10 to 7 is a 30% drop. And it doesn't mean anything.

So again, all the sources in your link are garbage. **None of them are meaningful empirical studies.** The only one that seems remotely academic or rigorous is from 1996, and is behind a paywall. 

You are either acting in bad faith or completely out of your intellect's depth in meaningfully evaluating these claims, which are themselves, garbage. Sorry dude.","2_1_1"

It examines the drop in admission rates without accounting for population increases nor demographic shifts during the same time period. Meanwhile college class sizes haven't kept pace with population, so of course admission *rates* would have dropped. The [original UCLA study](http://care.gseis.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/care-brief-raceblind.pdf) this article was based on even admits this in Footnote 13, which I'll post again below. Classic case of Simpson's paradox.

Footnote 13:

&gt;Admissions  rate declines in the UC starting in the mid-1990s can likely be  explained by a combination of  population increase in California...  Around the turn of  the 21st century, California experienced an  extraordinary population growth among high school graduates known as  Tidal Wave II, which led to an increase in the number of college-ready  state residents prepared to apply to the UC. At the same time, the  states financial investments into public higher education declined,  limiting the capacity of  the public university system to meet the  populations demand for post-secondary education. Thus, the growth in  applications from eligible California high school graduates outpaced the  availability of seats in the university system.

(Come  to think of it, it's shocking to me that they left this crucial fact in  an obscure footnote instead of having it as a controlled variable).

Look, I'm actually not against race-conscious admissions. I acknowledge that race and diversity has a role to play in education. But unless I'm missing something articles like this one borders intellectual dishonesty, which doesn't help anyone. Has there been any real evidence that suggests Prop 209 was in fact the *cause* behind the correlation?","4"

There is a lot of good stuff there (and his previous post) but this stands out.

Nearly twenty years ago, California voters passed Proposition 209, a ballot measure that effectively outlawed affirmative action in state-run institutions. Among other effects of Prop 209 was the loss of affirmative action policies  the ability for college admissions officers from being able to consider race among other application criteria  in the state-wide UC college system.

Prop 209 has had a devastating effect on UC schools: Black, Latino, Native American, Southeast Asian American and Pacific Islander admission rates have dropped precipitously relative to the pace of their population growth over the last twenty years, resulting in a public, taxpayer-funded university system that has effectively excluded many of the states underrepresented minority community  roughly 45% of the states total population  from access to quality secondary education.

Prop. 209 has resulted in the elimination of services such as college preparation programs for students of color, summer science programs for girls, outreach to minority- and women-owned businesses to notify them of government contracting opportunities, and funding for training of minority professionals in fields where they are underrepresented. It has ended the requirement that state boards reflect the population of the state and also ended numerous voluntary K-12 school integration efforts.

You linked *this* article, an article showing a very misleading graph, with the title ""Affirmative Action benefits Asian Americans"".

But alright, let's have a look at the additional resource. Reading through what you quoted, it sounds like there's a good argument for how eliminating affirmative action has harmed minority groups. It also eliminated beneficial services such as science programs for girls, government contracts to minorities and women, etc. However, all of these arguments are general arguments in favor of affirmative action and increased diversity. Now as I've mentioned before, I recognize many of these points. But none of them has to do with specifically benefiting Asian Americans - like the title of your post would suggest --

Unless, what you mean to say is that Asian Americans also benefit from the increased diversity brought by race-conscious policies, and that we as a group stand to gain from thinking beyond simple self-interest. But of course, if this is what you meant, then the main article here showing the admission stats following Prop 209 is completely detracting. The highlight of your post is showing a specific set of (highly misleading) statistics, but your main point is buried in footnotes and additional resources. I'm sure you can see how people are easily misdirected here.","4_1_1"

### Since California eliminated affirmative action in its public  universities, Asian American students have been less likely to get into  the UC system than under an affirmative action regime.

Let's say we have a university that claims to serve the entire natiom, so the community is made of the very rich 0.1%, middle next 30%, and the rest is poor or poverty line. If their class size is 1000 they get to admit only 1 very rich person. Of course economic status is a gradient, and to prevent the tragedy of the cutoff we will consider upper-middle (2%?), middle (30%), and the transitional lower-middle (40%?), and lower class (69.9%).

Note that the percentage added up to more than 100%, that's because the upper/middle/lower quota is one strict requirement, (0.1/30/69.9), with another strict requirement of 2%(?) transitional upper-middle whose income range covers the lower part of the upper class and the upper part of the middle class. Similarly the transitional 40%(?) lower-middle which covers the lower part of the middle class and the upper part of the lower class is also a strict requirement. This should prevent people from feeling cheated by having like $100 more income than the cutoff line, since they belong mainly to the transitional quota.

These quotas are strict, and other criteria are considered after. Universities are free to choose the community they serve to game the percentage, provided that they declare it very clearly with statistical data to support. I think it's fair that they get controlled by their own rhetoric. It should also be easier and more justifiable to balance race and score while satisfying this process.

When I read the news I immediately went searching for a forum where folks might have civil discourse on this topic.

Just had a few comments/questions:

1. Has anyone come across seemingly legitimate data sets on asians &amp; college admission with respect to Affirmative Action (AA for short going forward)
2. As an Asian (not born in the US but pretty much assimilated here for 35+ years), I am conflicted. Research results like this one show: [https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/) that something like 53% Asians think AA is a good thing, and yet when you scroll down and look at the question of ""Should colleges consider race/ethnicity in college admissions,"" the percentage of Asians that say yes are at 21%, no at 76%.

I am part of the 76%.... and I'm conflicted. I know especially for the underserved, AA makes a significant impact in giving folks better chances at life which in turn translates to diversity in every facet of work, society, life in general, which I view is a good thing.

But specifically regarding college admissions.. say for my own kids? (not college aged yet)  I would like to see more data on whether year 2000 and beyond AA in college admissions was harmful to Asians in general. In my own experience (anecdotal, totally not data science driven), I feel like AA in college admissions has hurt friends and family, in a reverse sort of sense.

But for the sake of the underserved, I didn't want AA to go away. So I am deeply conflicted.

Your thoughts?","3"

I understand where the conflicted feelings come from. But the more I think about this, the more I agree with that 76%. There are 2 main arguments in favor of affirmative action:

1. Race heavily intersects with socioeconomic class. Many underrepresented minority groups are disproportionately poor, which places them at a disadvantage.
2. Diversity is important in education, and race is part of that.

For 1, if the argument is that race intersects with socioeconomic class, then we should be implementing affirmative action *based on* socioeconomic class. After all, there are many poor families of Asian/Indian descent, for example. And not all black/latino families are poor. Implementing a socioeconomic based affirmative action system would be far more beneficial to poorer communities compared to reducing applicants to a race checkbox.

For 2, I do agree that diversity is important in education. But I've always doubted that colleges truly cared about diversity. In reality universities consistently admit from the same wealthy families, the same elite circles, race notwithstanding. So while race-based admissions can *appear* to bring diversity on the surface, it does little to bring a genuine diversity of perspectives, experiences, and viewpoints. Which is all the more reason to move to a economic class based system. (Jay Caspian Kang says it well in his [2022 opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/opinion/affirmative-action-harvard.html): ""What do 'diversity' and 'equity' really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1% as from the bottom 20?"")

And of course, all of this become even more questionable when you consider that many of these schools have admissions policies towards Asians that are suspicious at best. The completely opaque ""personality scores"", the higher test scores required, etc. I think we're lying to ourselves if we say that there's been no bias at all against Asian applicants, even if not with outright malicious intent.

So in short, I do believe that diversity is important, from classrooms to boardrooms to athletics fields. But I think that there are far better ways of achieving it. In fact, the current race-based system used by colleges just feels lazy, not to mention how much it hides the massive *lack* of diversity on campuses. Going forward, I'd like to see schools actually reach out to lower income communities, contribute towards underfunded schools, and be less influenced by wealthy, powerful elites.","3_1"

In essence, the framing of the question isn't really asking specifically about changing only race as a factor, but rather completely remaking the admissions process. Far more Asian Americans are against considering legacy and athletics in admissions, both of which strongly discriminate in favor of wealthy white students and are strongly entrenched.

But we don't live in a perfect world where we will be completely changing how college admissions work. In practice, affirmative action works as an imperfect aid in a flawed system, and people seem to recognize that. [Most people don't think the Supreme Court should ban race-conscious college admissions](https://apnews.com/article/affirmative-action-race-college-admissions-supreme-court-1b587cb63edc2fa192ad9ec5f27979e5).

Me neither. People are forgetting that this ruling is a gateway to an attack on any D&amp;I initiatives, including ones designed to help Asians, who are very underrepresented once you leave elite colleges or entry-level white-collar professional jobs.

If one is okay with Affirmative Action going away, then you are okay with Asian under-representation elsewhere because it's the exact same logic, e.g. Why should A24 take on traditionally underrepresented Asian stories? Why use race in determining which movie to be made? Why should Michelle Yeoh win an best actress Oscar just because an Asian has never received one? Why should Biden have a diverse cabinet?

Imagine if a major Hollywood studio had a program/workshop for Asian-American writers to bring in traditionally underrepresented voices in film/TV. Are people here against that? By the same logic of being against AA, you would have to be against such programs.","3_3"

I have a high level of doubt that AA going away or staying would have any effect on those programs suddenly materializing.

In a hypothetical scenario, imo it would be totally OK for AA in higher education if Asian-Americans reciprocally received positive discrimination in underrepresented industries. As it stands, it seems unfair - Asian-Americans have to work harder to get into prestigious universities because they are overrepresented in them yet they also have to compete on equal grounds in other spheres despite often being underrepresented there.

Good, there shouldn't be any programs to uplift Asians into sports. There shouldn't be help. That's racial discrimination and Asians need to get on their own merit.

Affirmative action in unis was not created yesterday and has been active for years but there were no reciprocal measures in other major sectors like sports or entertainment.

I'm not a doctor, but I am a Mechanical Engineer.

There were about 7,000-ish students in my entry class for the School of General Engineering and Applied Sciences; of those 7,000, only about 600 of us met the requirements to enter the Department of Mechanical Engineering (The ME program at my university was the second hardest program to get into behind Chemical Engineering), and of the 600 of us that entered, only about 40 of us completed the ME program.

Ultimately, it didn't matter how each of those 7000 students got in, only 40 of us had what it took to stick around to the end of the ME program.

What Asian Americans dont take into consideration is how vastly racism, poverty, and discrimination impact children in school.

At no point. And this is what affirmative action is meant to address the lack opportunity that is faced by many students simply because of their racial and economic background.

I also think that in the grand scheme of things, affirmative action is only used in very selective colleges (where there are probably more valedictorians with perefct test scores than there are spots), and not where most people go to school which is community college and big state universities, which are not very selective and mainly pick based on grades, test scores, etc. Honestly, most community colleges/universities will select you if you can pay and I wish people would stop obsessing over Harvard.

I remember the Shark Tank episode of that lady who supposedly graduated top of her class at Harvard who had some subscription service for early-childhood development toys. It was a decent idea and she had 3 of the sharks on board for her, but she kept trying to argue with them over the ownership/royalty split; one shark asked for 15% ownership she'd argue that they only get 7.2%, another would ask for 8% ownership plus royalties and she'd offer 7.6% with royalties.

By the end, all 3 sharks rescinded their offers because is was clear that she was just arguing for the sake of arguing and that she only cared workshopping a deal rather than running an actual business.

This has been a major reason in why students of color tend to drop out or transfer at a higher rate compared to white students. Furthermore, with universities placing a greater emphasis on racial affirmative action, and less emphasis on socio-economic background, many students of color that are accepted in highly selective universities tend to come from similar upper-class backgrounds.

The anticipated, devastating effects of the ban on preferences at UCLA and Berkeley on minorities were among the chief exhibits of those who attacked Proposition 209 as a racist measure. Many predicted that over time blacks and Hispanics would virtually disappear from the UCLA campus.

And there was indeed a post-209 drop in minority enrollment as preferences were phased out. Although it was smaller and more short-lived than anticipated, it was still quite substantial: a 50 percent drop in black freshman enrollment and a 25 percent drop for Hispanics. These drops precipitated ongoing protests by students and continual hand-wringing by administrators, and when, in 2006, there was a particularly low yield of black freshmen, the campus was roiled with agitation, so much so that the university reinstituted covert, illegal racial preferences.

Throughout these crises, university administrators constantly fed agitation against the preference ban by emphasizing the drop in undergraduate minority admissions. Never did the university point out one overwhelming fact: The total number of black and Hispanic students receiving bachelor's degrees was the same for the five classes after Proposition 209 as for the five classes before.""

edit: just wrapped up a work meeting, and wanted to get more thoughts out.

https://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/reardon_white_paper.pdf

This academic paper suggests (emphasis mine, where SES = socio-economic status)

&gt;Second, while it has been argued that affirmative action can lead to academic mismatch for
minority students, **we find no evidence that this is a systematic result of affirmative action
policies.** Moderate levels of race- and/or SES-based affirmative action appear unlikely to
result in high-achieving minority or low-SES students enrolling, on average, in colleges
where their academic preparation was below the average level for the college they enrolled
in. Similarly, we find that affirmative action has little effect on the average academic
preparation of students in the colleges of the typical White and high-SES student

Additionally: 

&gt;Until racial disparities in educational preparation are eliminated, then, other strategies are
needed. **Our analysis here suggests that affirmative action policies based on socioeconomic
status are unlikely to achieve meaningful increases in racial diversity. That is not to say that
socioeconomic affirmative action would not be valuable in its own rightit would increase
socioeconomic diversity on university campuses and would benefit low-income college

""After Affirmative Action Ends""  -New Yorker

https://archive.fo/gsEkW

In 2013, the Court, in Fisher v. University of Texas, discussed a race-neutral admissions method that was enacted by the Texas legislature: the top ten per cent of students in every high school in the state were automatically guaranteed admission to any of the states public colleges or universities. Because de-facto residential segregation resulted in de-facto school segregation in much of the state, admitting the top ten per cent of each high school meant that a large number of Black and Latino students would be admitted to colleges and universities in Texas. That would produce significant racial diversity on campuses without admissions officers considering applicants race.","26"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/14m8mf4/megathread_supreme_court_ruling_on_affirmative/","Sea5115","2023-06-30",1688093800,13,13,0,0,"I largely agree with this:  [https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/29/opinion/affirmative-action-supreme-court-harvard.html)

In practice, affirmative action at elite universities is done at the expense of Asian Americans, and so it had to be done away with.   


Many people have been marginalized, including Asian Americans, over time.  So the supreme court is requiring them to find a system that finds diverse candidates without disadvantaging Asian Americans.","27"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/14m8mf4/megathread_supreme_court_ruling_on_affirmative/","memorychasm","2023-06-29",1688079722,9,9,0,0,"There's a lot to discuss here. Echoing what some others have said, I'm conflicted. For one, today's ruling takes away opportunities from underserved groups, yet underserved Asian Americans may no longer be passed over due to the race factor. For another, Asian Americans do broadly stand to gain from all this, because AA's implementation had shown to lower our acceptance rates. Yet its removal may be moot if college admissions councils decide to continue discriminating against us under the table, particularly on account of our names or declarations of race - if applications still ask for these. Honestly, applications should omit names and race entirely, including from essays (unlike what the majority opinion wrote). 

At the same time, removing AA seems like a ""duh"" moment. After all, forcing diversity and equity in higher education simply isn't the answer. It's part of the problem, just like admitting legacy or donors' kids. Instead, it should all be organic. Let me idealize a bit here. The brightest go to the best schools and get access to the best networks, regardless of race or family wealth. And the way to do that is to reform the secondary education system at both the state and federal levels. Better funding, better teachers' pay, better facilities, more accreditation. Less gerrymandering, less redistricting, less redlining, less preferential loans. This is where more tax dollars should be allocated. In the meantime, admissions should adjust to prefer lower household income as others have said. I imagine this must be a better catchall than race for the purpose of lifting up the disadvantaged.

When the playing field for American secondary schooling is equalized across all communities, that's when colleges can freely sieve the candidate pool. Once the country organizes this way, students can be confident that pursuing the best grades, extracurricular involvement, and leadership qualities will indeed result in the best outcomes for themselves. I say this with a vested interest, as both me and my sister were top of our respective classes and had glowing recommendations, yet lower-ranked non-Asian classmates with fewer extracurriculars and less volunteering, work or leadership experience had made it to better colleges. It felt defeating that hard work and community involvement did not, in fact, pay off as an Asian American in this country.

Will today's ruling relieve that anguish I felt? Nope. It doesn't do away with racism, but it does do one thing well. I'll use an example to show what I mean. If I need surgery, I want the best doctor available. I don't care if they did extracurriculars or volunteered at a food bank, much less what race they are; I just want to know that they know their stuff so I can maximize my chance of a post-op recovery. It's wild to think that a med student at Harvard could have gotten in with [just a 3.2 GPA](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/new-chart-illustrates-graphically-racial-preferences-for-blacks-and-hispanics-being-admitted-to-us-medical-schools/) because Harvard needed one more minority to fill some quota for PR purposes. And that student could graduate, hang their diploma on the wall of their own practice, and many patients would be none the wiser because they'd think that ""Harvard graduates must be the best."" Which would be true if, say, a 3.9 student were admitted in the 3.2 student's place, and today's ruling hopefully makes this more likely. Will colleges still find some way to increase diversity? Of course, as they should. But soon it won't be by something as seemingly facile as race. 

Nothing suggests that today's ruling will change anything under the table for Asian Americans either, and the optics of the AsAm community being used as a political football are totally problematic. But oh well, it's still a step in the right direction.","28"

Don't pay attention to all the rich kids getting to pay their way in. Look at all the ethnic groups getting in because how unfair that is to the Asian students that try so hard.

Choosing someone for a position/university spot based on ""race"" or gender is inherently racist/discriminatory, I have a hard time seeing how this complies with the fundaments of law and equality. (Is it a continuation/progress of the civil right movement to use discrimination to combat ""perceived"" injustices? Wouldn't it be better to tear down the walls of inequality and unite those who stand for common rights and freedoms against those who seek power to use systems for their advantage/ideologies/etc?

Is it fair to implement an unjust system to combat a different unjust system? (eg. rich white Americans buying their way into colleges) Is this fair for eg. white Americans coming from very low income households from the Midwest or somewhere, in communities where maybe all forms of drug addictions are common and ""schools don't offer the best education""? Would it be fair to give a black American from a wealthy background the advantage solely based on skin colour?

How do Asian Americans feel about (American) notions of ""race"" in contrast to ethnicity? How much in common have eg. People of Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Phillipino origin to each other to feel and speak as a group? How much do you feel (culturally) united or share struggles? (not against it, but it can be misused to nourish ""group think"" "" You are part of my group, help me in my cause/crusade!"")

Are the tests as basis for entrance to colleges enough? Or can they be played and engineered? eg. learning exactly for tests while maybe lacking skills in critical thought or empathy? How much does performance in tests correlate to good academic performances?

How come black American struggle so much while coming partially from similar low income households as Asian Americans? What issues do they face? What skills/systems/schools/social structures need to be created/supported/etc.? How far should groups be supported in the name of diversity and why? Shouldn't we work on giving poor people independent of skin colour fair chances of success? Wouldn't it be better to work on better schools, fair laws/institutions/police/healthcare/working chances, affordable good funded universities, fair wages and worker rights? (not being forced to work overtime etc.) (trying to create a system where the will of voters mean sth and not just the one of mainly businesses/rich)

Why does it seem impossible to implement fair, open and affordable colleges? How come they are in such positions of power to play the game how they like? Wouldn't it be better to fight massive wealth inequality and media powerplays? Fair courts and law making (representing the will of the people)?

How would any injustice be combated in the US through ""more diversity"" if we favour another? Why not fight any injustice/discrimination where it is? Why not seek answers for societal issues? Why not found independent of politics/parties big social movements for all Americans (or enough) (eg. fair wages movement, fair courts, peoples rights to sue companies for causing environmental disasters)? Trying to get your rights, your freedoms, living wages back?

Thus, while UNC has been getting less publicity than Harvard, the fact is that legacy admissions are being used as a red herring to obscure the fact that racial justice was achieved for the most forgotten Americans (Asian-Americans). This is especially true because the court was not asked to consider legacy admissions.

If the court was indeed asked to consider legacy admissions as well, then I would agree with all the people decrying the ruling. Unfortunately, I cannot side with any of them because however small, we have to realize this is a victory for racial justice. We cannot punish those who still manage to succeed in the face of institutionalized white privilege in the name of advancing those who suffer long-term effects of slavery and Jim Crow (Blacks) and/or those who were absorbed by military conquest and faced less well-known Jim Crow-type situations (Hispanics). Moreover, the court did rule that colleges and universities are still allowed to consider a students observations on how race affected their life, without using race itself as a deciding factor for admissions.

Lastly, the strongest arguments that have been made in favor of affirmative action are ultimately those rooted in economics more than race. A person whose family paid for SAT tutoring has an unfair advantage over a poor kid who flips burgers after school to feed a broken family, and this is a bigger obstacle than color or facial structure even when being dark leads to unfair police profiling. Let affirmative action be based wholly or primarily on family socioeconomic status, otherwise the biggest beneficiaries will be wealthy Black and Latino kids more than those affirmative action purports to help-and let legacy admissions be challenged in a separate lawsuit for effectively functioning as affirmative action for the generationally-wealthy.","40"

Going with your argument, the NBA and NFL should have significantly more whites, as blacks are massively over represented.

73% of NBA players are black. 17% white. Only 0.4% are Asian. By your logic, there should be 17x as many Asians in the NBA to get proportions right. Let's save a few lottery picks for only Asian players then.

In the Harvard data, a Black candidate in the 4th lowest academic decile had a higher chance of getting in than an Asian candidate in the top decile. Imagine a DIII Asian basketball player being a lottery pick in the NBA.

I am for affirmative action. Why? 

Let's take a look at medical school admission. The number of slots is largely limited to the # of residency slots (funded by medicare). So it's a zero-sum game. For every white med school student is one fewer latinx med school student. For every azn med school student is one fewer black med school student. [We know that black med school students aren't as ""competitive"" as their azn counterparts](https://www.shemmassianconsulting.com/blog/medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race#part-2-medical-school-acceptance-rates-by-race). (i'm too lazy to calculate confidence intervals after 5pm). 

However, [we also know that in areas with black doctors, black residents have better health outcomes](https://www.statnews.com/2023/04/14/black-doctors-primary-care-life-expectancy-mortality/#:~:text=Other%20studies%20have%20shown%20that,blood%20tests%20and%20flu%20shots.) So in using a utilitarian argument for maximizing public health, we *should* maximize the # of black medical students. Yes, they should be academically capable of finishing med school and passing the boards (as a dropout is a wasted slot). So sorry Sarah Chen with a 4.0 GPA from Stanford, maybe we shouldn't let you in so we can let a black student in.","56"

For sure.  It's surprising for me that people consider Fujianese people (in the US) to be wealthy when the Fujianese community around me growing up (in NY for the most part) was overwhelmingly working class people.  People like my parents (who actually went FJ to HK to US, as did many others in our circles) and various relatives came as restaurant workers or store clerks so their kids could eventually get white collar jobs (or own/take over the restaurant when they're old enough). I have relatives that have done well for themselves, but none that were wealthy before immigrating here.

Maybe it depends what part of FJ we're talking about.  For us, it was not at all surprising to hear workers at a Chinese takeout or a cheap sushi/Thai/Asian fusion place speaking to each other in Fuzhou dialect.

Sure there are wealthy people from poor southern provinces like mine that are better off than working class families in Fujian or Guangdong, but specific individual cases like this don't matter to the problem of discrimination. It is more about the overall perception of wealth associated with regions in broader Chinese society. I have met many older working class Cantonese who associated people from my home region with some pretty negative stereotypes despite my own achievement (I'm not skilled labor immigrant or h1b but doing okay). Obviously not everyone holds backwards views and my goal wasn't to say that EVERYONE from Guangdong or coastal regions are wealthy, but these regions are wealthy and that is a fact and a major factor in regional discrimination, rather than the simple South/North divide explanation that the other comment suggested that often ignores the experience of southern Chinese from poorer provinces.  

Working class families in provinces where I am from would consider working class families in Guangdong and Fujian to be wealthier than they are. Having a Guangdong hukou is considered a desirable thing for many working class families where I am from. That is not saying people from Fujian or Guangdong don't experience working class struggle or they are not working class or nobody from these regions are poor. But regional differences does matter at least to some degrees when it comes to immigration patterns. Working class families from poorer provinces often didn't have the same opportunities or connection to immigrate as those from wealthier provinces. There is a reason why the overwhelming majority of both wealthy and working class immigrants for many decades are from wealthy coastal regions instead of poorer inland regions, although the immigration pattern at least on the working class family immigration part is slowly changing and I am seeing more working class people from provinces economically similar to mine immigrate here.

For sure the wealthy h1b or skilled workers are definitely more well off than all of us. It actually kinda fits that GDP map I linked considering those cities/regions with very high GDP per capita number are where most of the h1b/skilled workers came from (the wealthy mainlanders everyone is talking about lol).","2_3_1_3_1"

I don't know and it's not relevant. The entire justification for affirmative action is to deal with white supremacy, not Chinese supremacy. Filipinos are (slightly) over-represented both relative to whites and the entire population - I don't see how a university using AA policies even with Asians disaggregated would have any positive effect (at best) on Filipinos; in fact, why even the concern about Chinese over-representation?

&gt;here werent many Chinese Americans originally from and living in North Carolina either, so IMO cant compare Filipinos and Chinese students originally from the southeast attending Duke because there werent many to begin with.

It's not because of North Carolina - it's because of the East Coast/midwest presence.  Chinese American demographics are shifted significantly more ""east"" than Filipinos.  59+% of the Filipino-American population lives in the Western US (CA, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada).  It's closer to 42% for Chinese-Americans.  As one extreme example, NY state Chinese:Filipino ratio is 4x.

That said, I doubt you found many Californians at Duke who are there for academic reasons -- most Californians will choose a UC over Duke.","8_1_1_1"

Who knows. The support fell so fast (37% in 4 years!) that it could just be a timing thing and broader AA support among Asians might be significantly lower now anyway.  The advocacy passion may come from extreme attentiveness toward education and focus on getting into the best school possible.   Finally, it's important to note the survey itself might be biased.  Most Americans think [race should not factor into college admissions](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/02/25/most-americans-say-colleges-should-not-consider-race-or-ethnicity-in-admissions/) \- and it's possible that Chinese Americans (because it's talked about more) are more likely to interpret affirmative action as meaning that.  \[Also another weird thing about this poll -- Vietnamese and Filipinos tend to skew considerably more Republican than other Asians (even Chinese), so I'm not sure if this really reflects what people think about racial preferences\]

One of the most first, overt cases of using racial diversity to justify reducing Asian numbers was the controversy around NYC  high schools, a place where Chinese Americans (many below the poverty line) are highly over-represented (and pretty much about equal to other minority groups by SES metrics)","8_1_1_1_1_1"

At the same time, they still maintain a heavy emphasis on personal initiative to get ahead in life.

At the same time, there are my friend's parents who are from Mainland China, arriving within the last 20 years or so, who fervently reject affirmative action as disadvantaging their own children. In Northern Virginia, this is attitude is especially pronounced.

They were executed in the late 60s after years of imprisonment and struggle sessions, ultimately they were pronounced to be reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries.

He also described the years of hunger and famine both before the revolution and the sporadic bouts during. He would describe how he had to eat dirt when he couldn't tolerate the stomach pain, how he and his brothers would fight over grass.

Imo most of the early established Chinese communities are from Guangdong because Guangdong has always been the more economically developed region compared to rest of southern China especially in trade.

&gt; In the commencement speech that Drew Gilpin Faust, then the president of Harvard, gave in 2009, she interpreted Veritas, the universitys motto, as the commitment to use knowledge and research to penetrate delusion, cant, prejudice, self-interest. One of the final messages she sent out before stepping down, in June of this year, referred to veritas again, in the mode of crisis management. (I received the message as a Harvard employee and an alumna of its law school.) A civil-rights lawsuit that was filed against Harvard in 2014, alleging that its undergraduate-admissions process discriminates against Asian-Americans, was moving forward in court, and Faust wrote in response, Harvard will vigorously defend its longstanding values and the processes by which it seeks to create a diverse educational community. The plaintiffs portrayal of facts about Harvard would be inaccurate, she claimed, and she was committed to ensuring that veritas will prevail. The implication was that Harvard was defending against nothing short of an assault on truth itself.

&gt; The lawsuit, which will go to trial next week in federal district court in Boston, has been called the Harvard affirmative-action case, and it has been spoken of as if it could end affirmative action at Harvard and elsewhere. Both the plaintiff, a national group called Students for Fair Admissions, and Harvard benefit from describing it that way, but, in fact, the stakes are somewhat different. Students for Fair Admissions was founded by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who has orchestrated several lawsuits challenging affirmative action, and the initial complaint included a demand that the court declare it illegal to use race as a factor in college admissions. But, in keeping with Supreme Court precedents, the judge in the case, Allison D. Burroughs, has granted judgment in favor of Harvard on that point. The question that remains for trial is whether Harvard has gone beyond what the Supreme Court has said are permissible ways to consider race in admissionsand, specifically, whether it has shown a special bias against Asian-American applicants.

&gt; Documents that came out in discovery in the lawsuit, and which were made public this past summer, revealed some startling facts. In 2013, Harvards Office of Institutional Research conducted an internal investigation of race bias in its admissions process and produced reports suggesting that it was biased against Asians. Among the most striking findings was that Asians were admitted at lower rates than whites, even though Asian applicants were rated higher than white applicants in most of the categories used in the admissions process, including academics, extracurriculars, and test scores. One exception was the personal rating. According to Harvard, this rating reflects the wide range of information . . . that bears on applicants personal qualities, and may shed light on the applicants character. The plaintiff claims that the use of affirmative action does not explain the negative effect on the admissions rate for Asians relative to whites. (Harvard said that its prior analysis was incomplete, preliminary, and based on limited inputs.) Warring expert economists retained in this case, both highly respected, interpret the data differently, owing to somewhat arcane disagreements about methodology: one concludes that the admissions rate for Asians is attributable to discrimination, whereas the other concludes that it is not. An unfortunate upshot is that, for Harvard to be right, it must be true that Asian applicants really did have worse personal qualities than white applicantsa suggestion that Harvard officials denied in depositions.

&gt; It has served Harvards interest for people to think that, unless it wins this case, affirmative action will be eliminated, and that Harvards treatment of Asian-American applicants was necessary to attain an acceptable level of diversity among its undergraduates. The many amicus briefs that have been filed in support of Harvard generally make those assumptions. One brief, filed by sixteen élite universities, including the rest of the schools in the Ivy League, states that if they were required to adopt race-neutral admissions policies they would no longer be able to effectively pursue the attainment of the type of diversity that advances their educational missions.

&gt; But to understand the stakes of the case, it is important not to conflate two separate concepts: the legal issue of affirmative action and the factual issue of whether Harvard discriminated against one particular racial group. The case against Harvard will be strongest if the allegations about how Asian applicants were evaluated relative to white ones turn out to be true. The defense of Harvard will be strongest if it can demonstrate that there is no way to fulfill the goal of diversity without suppressing Asian applicants relative to white ones to some degree. But answering these key factual questions does not entail upending the consideration of race as a factor in evaluating black or Latino applicants, or other groups that would be unacceptably underrepresented in the absence of race-conscious admissions.

&gt; There are serious questions about the future of affirmative action. The Trump Administration has made clear its preference for race-blind admissions policies, rescinding, in July, the Obama Administrations guidance encouraging schools to use race-conscious affirmative action. The Department of Justice filed a statement of interest on behalf of the plaintiff in the Harvard lawsuit, emphasizing the Supreme Courts view, expressed in 2003, that race-based admissions policies must be temporary. For affirmative action to remain legally permissible in higher education, it may need the support of the newest Justice, Brett Kavanaugh. In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh was questioned on whether he supports using race as a factor in admissions in order to achieve diversity on campuses. His response referred to his work in the White House for George W. Bush, noting that the President was interested in promoting racial diversity but believed in using race-neutral means first.

&gt; It makes sense that Harvard would try to use the general legality of affirmative action as a shield to defend itself against the ugly and specific allegations of intentional discrimination against Asians. It also makes sense for many Asians to feel hesitant about objecting to being discriminated against, fearing that their objection may jeopardize affirmative action itself. But the dispute that will need to be resolved this fall is about Harvards alleged discrimination, not whether affirmative action must go. Harvards new president, Lawrence Bacow, issued a message this week recognizing the trials potential to create divisions on campus, and urged, We must be quick to understand and slow to judge. If veritas demands finding that Harvard has in fact engaged in discrimination against Asians, one can safely root against Harvard and in favor of race-conscious affirmative action at the same time.","1"

Surely you can recognize that you're being intellectually dishonest here. If White people are 77% of the US population (which they are) and White students are 50% of the freshman class at Harvard in 2017 (which they are), they are dramatically under-indexing compared to their percentage of the population. It's irrelevant that they've squeaked by to be a majority of the student population.","2_2_1_1"

They were denying admission to students who were well above expected standard. They should have gotten in. They didn't need the extra boost from affirmative action.

So strict racial quotas are actually illegal. And affirmative action does not necessarily have to be proportional to population size. If that were case, only about 5.5% of the Harvard student body should be Asian. But I agree that we need to make sure that disadvantaged minorities are given an equal playing field. That doesn't have to come at the expense of Asians in this case.

We can break this down like so, the top 50% of students should get in based on merit alone, regardless of race, and ideally legacy. The other 50% should compete with affirmative action boost in effect. Even if this were the system used, Asian students would only make up about 30-40% of the student population. There is still plenty of room to allow other minorities in without compromising merit.

More importantly, **we are a minority**. We are not white. We are succeeding in-spite of white hegemony, not because of it.  **We are not the ones standing in the way of other races**. Our success should be welcomed and celebrated. If they lose this case, this is sets a dark precedence for other minorities. It will say you can do well, just not that well.

Admissions
Meritocracy or Bias?
Study finds that when white people are told of the success of Asian applicants, their commitment to basing admissions on grades and test scores drops.

By Scott Jaschik  
August 13, 2013
140 COMMENTS
 
NEW YORK -- Critics of affirmative action generally argue that the country would be better off with a meritocracy, typically defined as an admissions system where high school grades and standardized test scores are the key factors, applied in the same way to applicants of all races and ethnicities.

But what if they think they favor meritocracy but at some level actually have a flexible definition, depending on which groups would be helped by certain policies? Frank L. Samson, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Miami, thinks his new research findings suggest that the definition of meritocracy used by white people is far more fluid than many would admit, and that this fluidity results in white people favoring certain policies (and groups) over others.

Specifically, he found, in a survey of white California adults, they generally favor admissions policies that place a high priority on high school grade-point averages and standardized test scores. But when these white people are focused on the success of Asian-American students, their views change.

The white adults in the survey were also divided into two groups. Half were simply asked to assign the importance they thought various criteria should have in the admissions system of the University of California. The other half received a different prompt, one that noted that Asian Americans make up more than twice as many undergraduates proportionally in the UC system as they do in the population of the state.

When informed of that fact, the white adults favor a reduced role for grade and test scores in admissions -- apparently based on high achievement levels by Asian-American applicants. (Nationally, Asian average total scores on the three parts of the SAT best white average scores by 1,641 to 1,578 this year.)

When asked about leadership as an admissions criterion, white ranking of the measure went up in importance when respondents were informed of the Asian success in University of California admissions.

""Sociologists have found that whites refer to 'qualifications' and a meritocratic distribution of opportunities and rewards, and the purported failure of blacks to live up to this meritocratic standard, to bolster the belief that racial inequality in the United States has some legitimacy,"" Samson writes in the paper. ""However, the results here suggest that the importance of meritocratic criteria for whites varies depending upon certain circumstances. To wit, white Californians do not hold a principled commitment to a fixed standard of merit.""

Samson raises the idea that white perception of ""group threat"" from Asians influences ideas about admissions criteria -- suggesting that they are something other than pure in their embrace of meritocratic approaches.

He adds: ""While the principle of fairness may be a driving concern in peoples attitudes towards policies such as affirmative action, social welfare, and fair housing, the malleability of white respondents attitudes towards the importance of university admissions criteria in response to racial considerations indicates that public opinion about the importance of such criteria is anything but fair, at least if the definition of fairness entails a procedural fairness by which all groups should be subject to the same procedural process, i.e., same weighting of admissions criteria, when determining whether an individual should be admitted to a prestigious public university system, an opportunity that will significantly shape that persons life outcomes.""

And Samson noted in his presentation here that these concerns are not just theoretical. In 2009, the University of California Board of Regents changed the admissions criteria for the system, generally eliminating the requirement of SAT subject tests. Advocates for Asian Americans noted at the time that this shift was taking away a criterion on which Asian-American applicants tended to do better, on average, than other groups.","3_1_1_1"

If you read up on the case presented to the supreme court, Grutter vs. Bollinger, the main argument in favor isn't really about helping underrepresented minorities. The main argument is that a diverse student body helps accomplish the goals of the university and benefits the entire student body. I would agree with this. The SCOTUS ruling ultimately determined that the US Constitution ""does not prohibit the law school's narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body."" 

With that in mind, we can see that schools can alter admissions policies to combat the ""not enough UR minorities problem."" We all know a black/Hispanic student is going to get admitted before and white student with an identical application. However, it appears that Harvard (and most likely other universities as well) are using this same power granted by the SCOTUS to combat the ""too many Asians problem."" In this case, we see white students now being accepted in front of Asian students.

The intent of accepting more UR minorities is definitely good, unlike the nefarious intent of denying Asian applicants by giving them low personality scores. However, I believe that from a legal standpoint, the university is using the same legal power to accomplish both intents: the legal power to use race as a factor in admissions, as long as you don't have quotas. 

Discrimination against Asian applicants is complete bullshit. But I don't see how you can legally force Harvard and other schools to abolish this policy without completely stripping their ability to use race as a factor in admissions.

I like diverse student bodies, but university officials at Harvard have gone too far to exclude Asian applicants in order to maintain a strong plurality of whiteness in the student body.

I think the phrase ""This is why we can't have nice things"" fits nicely here.

All you do is complain that they're used as a boogeyman, but never directly question their motivations and goals (eliminating affirmative action).

Already read this yesterday and the related discussions on Twitter. When you look at how the opponents of affirmative action are receiving this article, the issue is that as long as affirmative action exists to provide advantage to underrepresented minorities, they want it gone. And they don't won't want to stop until that's the case.

I have the same middle position as you and Suk. But I'm realistic about where the opponents of affirmative action want to go with these cases and what their goals are. And who will be judging this? You now have 5 very right wing justices looking at it with a majority. Be realistic about what the actual outcome people are trying to push here. It ain't the rosy middle. She even says so:

&gt;For affirmative action to remain legally permissible in higher education, it may need the support of the newest Justice, [Brett Kavanaugh](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/brett-kavanaugh)

lol the support of Kavanaugh? Good luck with that. There's a theoretical position here that the Supreme Court would only rule on potential anti-asian bias, but what exactly do you see the outcome to be?  How does it get resolved? Will it get rid of legacy and donor preference? Or will they instead rule more broadly on the use of race as a factor itself?

Be realistic about where you position maps to the processes and potential outcomes. Suk is pointing out to one theoretical potential outcome and interpretation, not what will most likely play out.","7_2"

We disagree on whether point 1 is occurring or not, but that's different in terms of the outcome preferences.

And I'm realistic about the framing of the opponents of affirmative action - they do not share your goal of eliminating as what you see is potential anti-asian bias, but supporting admissions practices that promote diversity, particularly in regards to race. They want it ""race-blind"" and affirmative action eliminated. Because as long as there is some preference for race for the sake of diversity, they interpret it as discrimination against asians. You don't, it seems, but that's the outcome they believe and are pushing for, and is the goal behind cases like this one.","7_2_1_1"

She doesn't delve into this much, just offers the usual waffling testimony of a SC nominee. Instead, she provides one interpretation of the case. But in law, there are many ways to interpret - which is why justices matter so much and why the SC nominee fights have been so bitter, and have been so impactful.

Let's assume that there truly is significant anti-Asian bias compared to other races. How does it get resolved? 

How would we like it resolved? The court tells Harvard that it can no longer discriminate against Asians, but only compared to whites. That's you and me right? Great, but it still doesn't get rid of preferences related to legacy and donors that vastly benefit whites and according to David Card's testimony, accounts for a significant amount of the difference between Asian American and white admit rates, unless the court can spin that in. Dubious that SC, especially such a conservative court, will do so.

But as long as affirmative action or race conscious admissions benefits underrepresented minorities, there will be those that argue it's discrimination against Asians (and by proxy, whites). And there's strong indication that this court would take this broader and conservative-favorable ruling of just getting rid of race conscious admissions, period. The former case would require much more legal gymnastics than this one, and it's unlikely Kavanaugh is going to go with that, which Gersen hints at.

If there were more Gersens and they were justices and they were on the court, then this interpretation would be much more relevant. It'd be key. But we have 5 very conservative justices on the court, so what matters more is how they'll look at it.

It'd be one thing if this were launching a strong campaign to dismantle the nepotism of favoring legacies and donors. But this won't even touch it - instead, the plain goals for everyone around is to dismantle affirmative action. And that's what matters.","7_2_1_1_1_1"

By introducing personality scores into admissions, Harvard has introduced false racial stereotyping of Asian applicants into the problem. Yes it is true that there are underprivileged Asian kids living in ghettos or poor areas who are not scoring high on the SATs. Affirmative action is not good for them. I know because I have experience volunteering as a tutor in some of these areas.

But this issue is also harmful to the mental health of Asian kids growing up in middle class families in mostly white suburbs. So many of us say we need to talk more about mental health. Well, accuse me of over blowing it but this is part of what is harming some Asian kids mental health. We cannot accept white people falsely stereotyping Asian kids as these inhuman and robotic drones and making them hate themselves and each other. All of these things contribute to levels of internalized racism in different generations of Asian Americans.

It also colors the wider American perception of Asian Americans and excuses discrimination and crimes towards us. Americans will have less empathy towards people that they think have no personalities.","1"

Even as someone who believes in the importance of diversity, I think that ""personality"" score is a step backwards into racial stereotypes rather than something that facilitates diverse perspectives and backgrounds on campus. Especially since Harvard defines this personality score as ""[courage, integrity, and likeability](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/06/harvard-admissions-personality/563198/)"", which are completely subjective traits that are impossible to determine from a 30-second review of someone's college application. Not to mention, are we to just accept that the Harvard admission officers the ultimate authority on ""courage, integrity, and likeability""?

But as the article very clearly pointed out, the real issue is beyond admissions stats or some obscure score. The real issue is the artificial exclusivity imposed by these schools. They refuse to expand enrollments, despite the growing population and their swelling endowment accounts. Despite their undying vocal support for diversity, their classes are overwhelmingly the kids of wealthy families and past alumni year after year. (Great line from the article: *What do diversity and equity really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1 percent as from the bottom 20?*) Even when it comes to underrepresented racial minorities, rarely are those accepted from neighborhoods truly in need of uplifting.

It's actually a weighted average, with this [chart](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-769bc83b7206a14917ea05af095abfda-pjlq) providing the raw numbers for the applicants.

For example, there are 6,140 Asian American applicants who are in the top academic decile (the 10th decile is the highest, the 1st decile is the lowest) versus, for example, 91 African Americans.  And in the bottom decile, there are 5,550 African Americans versus 1,440 Asian Americans.

The reason why the (weighted) ""average"" shows Asian Americans having a higher average is because the median Asian American applicant is in the 7th or 8th decile.  In contrast, the median African American applicant is in the 2nd decile.

Despite the pretty marked difference in the academic quality of the applicant pool, a higher percentage of African American applicants nevertheless get a high personal score than Asian American applicants from the admissions office.  Of course, it may be the case that the average African American applicant has perhaps a more compelling life story due to a challenging upbringing, poverty, etc.  And you are right that the average Asian American applicant (who is the 7th or 8th decile) is more likely to get a high personal score than the average African American applicant (who is in the 2nd decile) from alumni.

But if you compare the raw percentages at each decile, which this [graph](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e2d876fe82eb504a4d97add6ccf2a40d-pjlq) does, the discrepancy I noted above becomes obvious, and is staggering at the higher deciles.

For example, at the bottom decile, 9.49% of the 5,550 African American applicants get a high personal score from the admissions office, versus 8.01% of the 1,440 Asian American applicants.  Not a huge surprise, since these are the applicants who performed the worse academically.  But note that there is still almost a 20% difference in favor of African American students (9.49/8.01=1.18).  Likewise, 30.96% of the same pool of bottom decile African American applicants get a high score from the alumni, versus 28.13% of the Asian American applicants.  The discrepancy narrows to about 10% (30.96/28.13=1.10), though it's pretty obvious that alumni reviewers are much more generous with high personal scores than the admissions office.

But if you go to the 5th decile, the difference is staggering.  33.89% of African American applicants are given a high personal store by the admissions office, versus 15.69% for Asian American students.  That 18 point gap is a 116% difference.

On the alumni side for applicants at 5th decile, 59.98% of African American applicants got a high personal score from alumni, versus 44.24% of Asian American applicants.  Still a pretty large 15 point gap, but here the African American applicant is only 35% more likely to get a high personal score.

It's actually not because Harvard exhibits an unconscious bias and thinks Asian Americans are stiff and lack personality (though I know that's how its made to sound in news articles). That may be (and probably is) true, but it's not the explanation for the personality ranks. Harvard ranks the personalities of *all* four major ""races"" exactly inversely proportional to each ""races"" cumulative academic strength. Blacks have (generally) the weakest academics, but the best personalities. Latinos the second weakest academics but second best personalities. Whites have the second strongest academics but second worst personalities.  Asians have the strongest academics but the worst personalities.

Ranking personalities this way gives Harvard much greater control over its racial composition than would be constitutional under existing Supreme Court precedent. The truth is Harvard simply doesn't want too many Asians in its class each year. How many is too many? For Harvard, its more than about 20%. Every single year, Harvard would let in 19-20% Asians. In fact, all racial percentages were effectively static regardless of change in the country's demographics. So that's what the case has really been about. ""Personality"" is just the opaque device Harvard is using to keep Asian American numbers down and other racial numbers, especially Black numbers up (whites and Latinos are mostly in the middle of all of this). Data suggests Harvard's class would be about 43% Asian if it removed affirmative action's racial considerations.

Why do this?  The reason  is actually not because Harvard hates Asians. That's a false narrative that you hear ***both*** pro-affirmative action and anti-affirmative action people argue. It's because Harvard, like all colleges, has a maximum number of seats each year. Asians, followed closely by whites, are the two groups that have the strongest qualifications. If Harvard Administrators were never told the race of the applicants, Asians and whites would comprise over 80% of its student population. Because black  (followed by Latino) applicants generally have lower grades and test scores than whites and Asians, those two groups would shrink the most to make room for an increase of the Asian class from 20% to 40%. (It should obviously go without saying there are black and Latino applicants with perfect scores). Harvard could reject more white applicants but, again, to do so solely because of those applicants' skin color would invite another obvious equal protection challenge--and rightfully so.

&gt; Asians, followed closely by whites, are the two groups that have the strongest qualifications.

Do white students really have the strongest qualifications? I don't think that necessarily tracks just from the finding that Asians and whites would make up 80%+ of the student population in a race-blind admissions system.

[This study linked elsewhere in the thread](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/study-harvard-finds-43-percent-white-students-are-legacy-athletes-n1060361) states that 43% of white students at Harvard are ""legacy, athletes, [or] related to donors or staff,"" 75 percent of whom would have been rejected if they had not come from those categories.

I think athletics are fine qualifications, but legacy, donor-relation, or staff-relation status ring hollow as qualifications, and I think that to assert that white students would actually have such strong qualifications, you'd want a statistic talking about class makeup with these categories stripped out, and/or discussing qualifications of rejected white applicants relative to other races.

&gt; Harvard could reject more white applicants but, again, to do so solely because of those applicants' skin color would invite another obvious equal protection challenge--and rightfully so.

Agreed. The sentence composition suggests that reducing white student class share would risk violating EQP, but I think it's worth clarifying that there are non-race-related methods that I think ultimately (post-litigation) wouldn't violate EQP. Going after legacy, donor, and staff-related admits are all methods I think that could balance out white seat share with appropriate legal cover. That said, will Harvard ever do this? Probably not.

I think this is honestly the segment that everyone should be going after. I don't just mean asians, either. There are probably a number of highly qualified white applicants who would also be getting in each year if a high percentage of the class were not getting in off their parents' laurels. This group makes up 15% of the Harvard class overall, which I think is pretty ridiculous: that equals the entire black seat share at Harvard, engulfs the latinx seat share, and is 60% of the Asian seat share.","3_1_1"

The admittance rate for Asians in the top decile of applicants is 12.7%. The admittance rate for whites in the top decile is 15.3%. That means its more likely for a white person to get in with the same academic grades. But then when you get to Latinos, the admittance rate in the top decile is a whopping 31.1%. And then the admittance rate in the top decile for black applicants its 56.1%. These are giant differences. If you follow the table all the way down in turns out that you can be in the fourth lowest decile in academics as a black applicant and you still have a better chance of admission (12.8%) than an Asian applicant in the top decile.

I find the white legacy article interesting, but too vague to be very compelling. First, the study your referencing doesn't do any comparisons between the four race groups . Lumping athletics in with legacy complicates things. What percentage of African Americans  get in from athletic scholarship vs Latinos? vs whites?  vs Asians?  Without breaking this down and giving comparisons its an interesting stat, but it has the possibility at least to be misleading.

Second, because Harvard is obviously capping the admissions rate for the four races year in and year out, its possible unqualified white legacy's are eating into the admission share of *other* more qualified white applicants.  Harvard wants the same number of Asians,, whites, Latinos, and blacks every year. So 51% of Harvard's class is white (and I argued this once with someone who said that means whites are actually underrepresented in Harvard since they are more than 51% of the general population in the U.S. and I laughed because that's technically true). That number stays pretty constant according to Harvard's data. But the article doesn't explain unless I missed it if the preference for white legacy's is actually hurting minorities or if its really just eating into Harvard's ""white seats."" Given the other data about the academic strength of whites and Asians, I suspect it doesn't hurt Latino and Black applicants as much as you might think. But this is just speculation without more detail in the article.

In any event, Legacy admissions need to go too. They aren't unconstitutional but they are anti-merit. I'm cool with donor admissions and athletics though.","3_1_1_1"

The study I'm referencing absolutely makes race-group comparisons. The article caption states that among black, latinx, and asians, each group has less than 16% of their respective admissions coming from each category. [The study proper](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26316/w26316.pdf) breaks down these categories and makes exactly these comparisons in Table 3. I agree that the individual statistic alone has the possibility to be misleading, but there absolutely are additional stats that back these observations up. It's a busy world, particularly as a lawyer, so I don't blame you for not having pursued this in-depth, but just because you haven't read the study doesn't mean the study doesn't substantiate the claim ;)

Yep! This is why I said, ""I don't just mean asians, either. There are probably a number of highly qualified white applicants who would also be getting in each year if a high percentage of the class were not getting in off their parents' laurels."" above. For example, the study indicates, that a white non-ALDC applicant has a roughly 5% chance of admission, while white legacy applicants have a 35% chance of admission.

&gt; Figure 4 shows that its far more likely a white applicant stole a spot than a black applicant. For a white applicant with a 31 MCAT score and a 3.7 GPA, for every black applicant who scored lower and was accepted there are, on average, 4.11 white students who also scored lower and were accepted.

&gt; Its only low-scoring white applicants (less than a 26 on the MCAT and a GPA less than 3.2) who are more likely to have their seats offered to black students than to white students. Yet at that end of the statistical spectrum, the chance of getting into medical school is less than 5 percent for both whites and blacks. But look at the average number of low-scoring black students accepted each year (132) and the total number of white applicants accepted each year (26,420). The chance that a low-scoring white medical school applicant will lose a spot to a low-scoring black applicant is 0.5 percent. How unlikely is that? Its even less likely as the applicant dying in a car accident.

&gt; Keep in mind that some schools admit a far larger number of students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in medicine (URM) than others, whether thats due to various race-based initiatives (e.g., historically black college or university; diversity initiatives), geography (i.e., certain states have relatively few individuals from URM backgrounds and prefer in-state students), or some other reason. 

&gt; There is one other major source of complication. Its well documented that race is strongly associated with socioeconomic status (i.e., educational attainment, income) and academic opportunity in the United States. Specifically, individuals from URM backgrounds tend to also have lower socioeconomic status and fewer academic opportunities.

&gt; Unfortunately, were also unaware of any data demonstrating the percentage of students accepted to medical schools by race, over and above socioeconomic status. Perhaps students who get in with lower statswhether from URM or ORM backgroundstend to also have lower socioeconomic status. Having access to this information would give us a more definitive answer.","3_1_1_1_2_1_1"

It's the equivalent to telling BLM who sue police for deaths, that they should instead file a lawsuit against the 2nd Amendment, because that's the ""real problem""  But you would **never dare do that**.

&gt; The two economists analyses vary in several ways. Perhaps most significant, their respective models include different kinds of applicants. Arcidiacono excludes recruited athletes, the children of alumni, the children of Harvard faculty and staff members, and students on a special list that includes children of donors.

&gt; Card includes them. Though the total number of students who fit those descriptions represents a small fraction of the applicant pool (5 percent), they account for a large proportion of accepted students (29 percent). That high acceptance rate, Arcidiacono said, made those applicants difficult to compare with others.

&gt; Card seemed perplexed by the decision to omit a sizable chunk of the pool. Ignoring this highly competitive group seems completely nonsensical to me, he said. If youre throwing away a third of the people who are going to be admitted, it just is not going to work, because you would not be able to look at whos being admitted compared to whos in that process.

&gt; And that, Card suggested, made his counterparts findings of racial bias less reliable.

My understanding is that the primary [claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College) is ""[Harvard] discriminates against Asian-American applicants in its undergraduate admissions process.""

&gt; The lawyers of SFFA, including lead trial counsel Adam Mortara (a partner of Bartlit Beck Herman Palenchar &amp; Scott and a lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School), stated that the lawsuit is focused on the issue of discrimination against Asian-American applicants, instead of trying to challenge affirmative action in general.

&gt; For the personal rating, Card includes the following variables: intended career; staff interview ratings; richer controls for high school and neighborhood characteristics; parents occupations; applicants hours worked (at a job); controls for specific combinations of profile ratings, specific combinations of teacher ratings, and specific combinations of alumni interview ratings; indicators for participation in different types of primary extracurricular activities; having parents who attended an Ivy League college, having parents who attended Harvard for graduate school, having a mother or father who is deceased, being a permanent resident of the United States, having been born in the United States, and having lived outside the US.

If - due to differing immigration pressures, past discrimination, self-selection, prestige-drive, etc. - Asian applicants, on average, differ in the variables I quoted above, that might explain what are, from what I understand, [""very slightly weaker""](https://medium.com/@dddefenddiversitydd/anti-asian-american-bias-exists-but-here-are-ten-reasons-not-to-fall-for-the-asian-american-71ef01195189) personal ratings on average.

&gt; Data suggests Harvard's class would be about 43% Asian if it removed affirmative action's racial considerations.

&gt; If Harvard Administrators were never told the race of the applicants, Asians and whites would comprise over 80% of its student population.

Don't those two statements kind of contradict each other? I'm aware that Harvard's preliminary internal review showed that if they only considered academic achievement, percentage of Asian students would rise from 19% to 43%. But I don't know what that second stat is referring to.","3_1_4"

I understand that the  idea of class being comprised of 43% of asians (or any race) feels not right to many ppl- but meritocracy must be held sacred. Shoehorning a solution to tweak the demographics at the university level is not the right thing to do- even if it is the quickest way to get that universitys diversity nbrs up (whether thats an altruistic goal for the uni or a self serving one is another discussion). The right thing to do, is to  apply affirmative action at the high school or even junior high level in the form of social/academic  outreach  (eg free prep classes) to black/hispanic kids to even the playing field - ie, empower them to realize their highest scores. To unlock their potential that their disadvantages have suppressed. Scores held equal, black/hispanic kids should then be given priority seats- as opposed to artificially bumping up some aggregate metric and using this to give priority.  

The right goal should not be to let more black and hispanics into Harvard, the right goal should be to let more black and hispanics who have the talent into Harvard.  As an analogy: Say you wanted to diversify your basketball team, but still wanted to develop the best players. You wouldnt recruit someone who shoots the ball pretty close to the basket, but cant actually make the shot. Instead maybe you would fund early training  programs to bring out the talent. 

Affirmative action as its employed now, is tweaking with quotas purely based on race at the expense of qualifications, which is discriminatory, ironically.

I also wonder what you seem to gain by taxing an entity's long term financial stability.

In 2014, the group sued the university, accusing it of discriminating against Asian students during its admissions process. After years of court filings and an actual trial, S.F.F.A. ultimately lost its case but immediately appealed to the Supreme Court.  
  
I spent much of 2018 and 2019 covering that trial and getting to know its main players. Edward Blum, the conservative legal activist pushing the lawsuit, was behind Fisher v. University of Texas, the last college admissions affirmative action case to reach the Supreme Court. In the 2010s, he also spearheaded Shelby County v. Holder, which effectively gutted the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He is a tireless activist who will now have his hearing in front of a 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. If the justices find in S.F.F.A.s favor, Blum will have had a hand in both disenfranchising thousands of voters and ending affirmative action as we know it.  
  
This work has turned Blum into a villain in progressive circles, and some have denounced the whole package as a right-wing program to end racial preferences and remediations in every corner of American life. I generally agree with this assessment and fear the world Blum might bring about.  
  
But its also important to assess the specifics of the Harvard case. When excised from the context of Blums crusade, they reveal a profoundly broken system that relies on obfuscation and misdirection, especially when it comes to the treatment of Asian applicants.  
  
Did Harvard discriminate against Asian students?  
  
This is a question with a both complicated and simple answer. On the one hand, proving that Harvard violated the legal standards set by earlier Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action is difficult, given both the amorphous nature of the admissions process and the intricacy and various contradictions in the law. As it stands now, colleges are allowed to consider the race of an applicant, but only to a limited extent and not in a way that resembles a quota system.  
  
But when you apply the normative definition of discrimination, in which race hinders an applicants acceptance into an institution, the case becomes much clearer. The evidence against Harvard on that front is, frankly, overwhelming. Asian applicants to Harvard routinely scored significantly lower than students of other races on their personal scores, a metric cobbled together from alumni interviews, essays and teacher recommendations. During the trial, Harvards attorneys did not really explain why this disparity existed, but only tried to prove that it did not come out of intentional or even implicit bias from anyone inside the admissions office. What seemed to be happening was that the people writing the appraisals were routinely downgrading Asian students, judgments that Harvard apparently accepted without any further investigation.  
  
I dont really know why Asians got low personal scores, but I do know that if Harvard drapes itself in the mantle of diversity, inclusion and equity, it should probably also take a look at the way it uses evaluations that seem to reflect bias. Harvard continues to use recommendations today.  
  
One of the clearest examples of Harvards history of anti-Asian discrimination that was presented at the trial centered around sparse country, a term Harvard uses to describe geographic regions that generally do not send a lot of students to the Ivy League. Sparse country students generally get a bump in the admissions process because the university seeks to have a student body thats geographically as well as racially diverse.  
  
In the past, Harvard recruited students from sparse country after they took the Preliminary SAT exams. To receive an invitation to apply to Harvard  yes, some students receive invitations to apply to Harvard  a Black student in sparse country needed to score above 1100 on the exams, a white student needed 1310, an Asian female student needed 1350 and an Asian male student needed 1380.  
  
This, by itself, seems like enough to prove that Harvard created a system for recruitment that certainly preferences one race over the other. The testimony given by William Fitzsimmons, the longtime dean of Harvard admissions, only made his office look worse. When asked to explain why Asian students from sparse country needed to score so much higher than white students, Fitzsimmons said, There are people who, lets say, for example, have only lived in the sparse-country state for a year or two.  
  
What he seems to be saying is that Harvard believes Asian students from sparse country are Asian before they are Arkansan or Nevadan or Alaskan and that whatever diversity benefit they might bring to the school will be based on their ethnicity, not from the state where they may have spent their whole lives. To Fitzsimmons, evidently, and by extension, the Harvard admissions office, Asian applicants are not citizens with legitimate ties to a community but are instead newcomers who should be thought of by their race.  
  
Evidence of this type of reductive racial thinking could be found throughout the trial. Past documents brought to light showed that Harvard would consider your ethnicity a plus only if you wrote your personal essay about its significance in your life or if it led to extracurricular involvement in ethnic community groups. If you were a minority student who did not belong to an affinity group in high school and you did not share a moment of trauma or triumph with strangers on the admissions committee for the most prestigious university in the world, Harvard would withhold the plus on your application.  
  
Does anyone really believe in a version of equity and diversity that forces minority students to, in essence, perform their ethnicity for Harvard, of all places?  
  
So, if all this is done in the name of diversity, what exactly does it look like at places like Harvard?  
  
I am an alumni of Bowdoin College, which at the time I attended, in the late 90s and early 2000s, had a very small percentage of Black, Latino and Asian students. The school has changed quite a bit since then, thanks to strong diversity initiatives. On the occasions Ive returned to campus, Ive come across students of all sorts of ethnic backgrounds who simply would not have been at Bowdoin in my era. This more inclusive atmosphere made me feel excited to be on campus, even as an adult, and undoubtedly would have improved my undergraduate experience. When you read the case law of affirmative action cases or diversity statements from exclusive colleges, they largely speak of the need to make all students feel comfortable and represented on campus. I do not dispute the importance of this.","6_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/sejv5m/opinion_its_time_for_an_honest_conversation_about/","[deleted]","2022-01-28",1643364791,49,49,0,0,"But while the percentage of students of color at Bowdoin has gone up to 35.1 percent in 2021 from an abysmal 7.5 percent in 1988, there has been little meaningful change in socio-economic backgrounds. Twenty percent of Bowdoin students come from families who make $630,000 or more a year. Sixty-nine percent come from families in the top 20 percent of income earners in the country. Only 3.8 percent come from the bottom 20 percent. Increased racial diversity has not changed the fact that exclusive schools cater almost entirely to a wealthy population.  
  
Bowdoin is far from being an outlier. A full 15 percent of Harvard students come from families who make $630,000 or more a year, and only 4.5 percent from the bottom fifth of income earners. Elite state institutions arent much better. Two-thirds of students at the University of Virginia, for example, hail from the top fifth; only 2.8 percent come from the bottom 20 percent.  
  
What do diversity and equity really mean, then, at an institution that has more than three times as many kids from the top 1 percent as from the bottom 20?  
  
The browning of these elite institutions should be seen as progress on its own, and it would be harmful if these trends were suddenly reversed. But to what extent is all this just window dressing? Elite schools in liberal cities, whether they are private elementary schools or the Ivy League schools, do not populate their websites with all kinds of faces out of some heartfelt desire to contribute to an equitable society. Rather, they push diversity because they know their customers  the students and their parents  want it. Plus, they couldnt get away with being majority white or even white and Asian without attracting a great deal of scrutiny.  
  
The impending Supreme Court decision will change none of this. Schools like Harvard that can fill their incoming freshman class many times over with top-tier applicants of every race are likely to maintain their diversity levels, more or less.  
  
Over the past two decades, theres also been a quiet but fierce argument over who, exactly, constitutes the Black and Latino student populations at elite colleges. At a Harvard Black alumni gathering in 2004, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and the late Lani Guinier, professors at the school, noted that perhaps as many as two-thirds of Harvards Black students were first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean or the children of biracial couples.  
  
This is an extremely fraught conversation to have because it asks a person to rank Black people in terms of oppression and could encourage schools to enact an even more specific and potentially xenophobic set of hierarchies. Black immigrants appear to be overrepresented at elite colleges when compared with African Americans who have descended from slavery. This, of course, is not the fault of Black immigrants who attend these schools, but rather the schools themselves, who have turned college admissions into a brutal, zero-sum game in which each minority applicant must also double as a racial statistic.  
  
I just want people to be honest enough to talk about it, Gates said in 2004. What are the implications of this?  
  
For me, the implications are as follows: At elite schools, affirmative action mostly serves an increasingly ethnically varied group of wealthy students and their families. As a result, the narrative around diversity in these places has been reduced to pure racial representation, which, while important enough, does not exactly fulfill the social mission that most people think is inherent to any affirmative action program  helping students whose families have suffered under generations of white supremacy. Anti-Asian discrimination, which I believe to be as clear as day, is one of the byproducts of all this balancing and weighting and obfuscation.  
  
Schools like Harvard have no one to blame but themselves. Their flimsy approach to diversity and their desire to stay as academically exclusive as possible have created an indefensible system of racial nonsense that demeans not only its Asian and Black applicants, but everyone else who has to play this absurd game.  
  
This, I believe, would be the honest starting point for conversations about affirmative action at elite schools.  
  
On Monday, I will write about what an alternative might look like.

&gt; Harvard uses a search list, which is primarily compiled based on potential applicants' ACT, SAT or PSAT test scores to help Harvard market itself to a diverse array of high school students. The ACT, SAT, or PSAT score that students need to make the search list varies by gender, high school GPA, geography, and race. For example, to make Harvard's class of 2018 search list, a white male high school student from outside ""sparse country"" needed an SAT score of 1380, while black, Chicano, Hispanic, Native American, and Puerto Rican students needed only an 1100.

&gt; As SFFA points out, there are some anomalies in the search list selection criteria that are difficult to explain. As an example, assuming an applicant reported a sufficiently high GPA, for the class of 2018, Harvard lowered the SAT score required to make the search list to 1310 for students from sparse country who identified their race as white, other, or unidentified while not simultaneously lowering the required score for Asian American students from the same states to the same level. Consequently, Asian American students from the same states needed to score 1350 or 1380, depending on their gender, to make the search list. Some Asian American students therefore did not make the search list, when white students from the same area who had similar grades and SAT scores did. SFFA, while recognizing that the list is a marketing tool, would have the Court consider this sparse country disparity between the scores required for Asian Americans and whites to make the search list as evidence of Harvard's intent to impose more selective admissions criteria on Asian Americans for the purpose of artificially suppressing Asian American representation at Harvard.

&gt; Notably, however, in some of the same years that Harvard did not lower the sparse country SAT search list score for Asian Americans commensurate with the lower requirement for whites, it selected Asian Americans for the search list based on lower ACT scores than similarly situated white students from more urban states. Overall, the inconsistencies in the search criteria do not seem to be linked to efforts to advantage or disadvantage any particular racial group, and it was unclear from the testimony at trial whether these variations were accidental or intentional. At root, although being placed on the search list results in recruitment and is correlated with a higher likelihood of admission, the search list is fundamentally a marketing tool that does not affect individual admissions decisions.","6_1_2_3"

not to mention saying that lowering act scores for asians in sparse countries means no discrimination is stupid when you compare it to urban whites. Urban kids have higher requirements as shown in the original article, based on the fact that they aren't receiving invitations to apply with the same scores that sparse country people are. If they wanted to show that asians aren't discriminated, they should have shown that sparse whites weren't given lower act requirements (in proportion to sparse asians) or that urban asians were (in proportion to urban whites) and that the original requirements for sparse/urban asians and whites were the same so that even after lowering the scores for asians-asians don't still need a higher score than white people.

1. Asian people aren't as expressive. But are they not as personal? I've learned that Chinese sports and movies and shows tend to suck, and some of my mainland friends tell me the upbringing is harsh and asks you to learn processes and memorize facts rather than be weird and think outside the box. I wonder if it's *legitimate* that maybe we aren't as creative impressionable IN THE AMERICAN WAY. So when you're writing your college essay or doing an alumni interview, you might not be waxing poetry the same way another more culturally expressive kid might. Or, straight up, maybe your high school resume is plain. Is this true or stereotype?

OR

2. Asian people aren't as expressive but does that mean they don't have expressions? I love the word tsundere. One thing I've learned growing up is sometimes the big mouthed loud spoken friendly person often is fake as fk and the quiet person ends up contributing a lot to the friendship. It's not what you say, it's what you do. As I started meeting Asian people in college for the first time, I thought they were boring but asthe friendship matured I realized it was way more fulfilling than my other friendships, a slow burn. 

The problem is you can't do that in college apps. And a lot of east Asian kids know about saving face, being humble, and being patient, but that just doesn't fly. So what you write a bomb ass essay showing how good a person you are. For the kid who's love language and communication style isn't that expressive, r they rlly worse of an applicant?


My last thought is
 
3. Asian kids are in a confusing cultural divide in a world foreign to them and have a weak sense of identity that contributes to a lack of story in the college app. Following tiger parents leads to weak story and boilerplate app. You got a 1600, won robotics club, took 18 APs, 4.5GPA, played tennis, was in 4 academic clubs. What's your story? All my ivy league friends were able to articulate a clear narrative on who they were growing up and how they intend to live their life. National ping pong champ turned doctor, Carnegie hall piano player turned book writer, small town thrift shopper turned biologist. I'm almost afraid bc of internalized confusion, external harassment, and strong willed parents, Asian kids aren't giving themselves the space to find themselves young. Maybe the low personal score is for a reason or maybe it's all bullshit.

Because they have the second strongest academic qualifications.

The personality point is a red herring. No matter how many qualified Asian applicants with 10/10 personalities applied,  Harvard was giving them bad personality scores because letting them in would mean less seats for their other race categories.

This is why the Affirmative Action system, while noble and originally helpful, has become utterly unworkable as America has become more diverse and racial lines have started to blur. It's become a slimy business which places way too much emphasis on race. An Asian applicant in the TOP decile (top 10%) of academic performance has a worse chance at getting into Harvard than a black applicant in bottom 40% of academic performance. That's not simply selecting an underrepresented minority all other things being equal. That's an entirely different selection standard. If you're OK with that, great. But that's like being OK with being forced to sit in the back of the bus. You may think its not big deal, but I find it outrageous.

Legacy admissions should go as a matter of objectivity as well even though they are not unconstitutional (and even though they are now, finally starting to help minorities).

**Admission into a prestigious university isn't a prize to be won by pre-university performance.** The way I see it now, prestigious universities have a responsibility to their communities to identify and equip those who will likely be leaders in the future, in part through education of their students, in part through giving students the opportunity to network with others of different backgrounds (and who will go on to pursue different paths), and in part by identifying applicants with that future potential. After all, 18 year olds are pretty much universally unimpressive - it's just that there are indicators of which ones have potential to be impressive adults in their 20's, 30's, 40's, and even 50's and beyond.

Seen through that light, university admissions should strive to admit a diverse incoming class, including socioeconomic, geographical, cultural, ethnic, and racial diversity, as well as diversity in intellectual interests and even age. Otherwise, if the students all come from a homogenous background, they will likely go back to that homogenous background and are less likely, as a cohort, to make impacts on broad swaths of society. So a prestigious university should want to admit students who have a chance at succeeding in their own areas across society, rather than lining up students who will all try to succeed by pursuing the same path after graduation. In the same way that a basketball team would want a more sophisticated recruiting procedure than ""let's just sign the tallest 12 players we can,"" a university should understand that they're recruiting for multiple positions, multiple roles.

Plus, a prestigious degree might be more valuable of a ticket to someone poor than someone who is already rich. In a sense, thinking about how to distribute a limited resource (fancy degree) towards the most productive use will favor distributing towards those for whom that degree provides the greatest delta over a replacement degree (less fancy degree). For someone who is poor, for whom the elite universities have generous financial aid packages, that delta might be huge if they fall back into getting admitted into a less affordable option, and have to dig out from a greater amount of student debt.

**Past experience with hardship can often reveal likelihood of future success better than raw academic scores.** Someone with 90th percentile test scores is much more impressive when they come from a poor background, and have parents who don't have college degrees, than someone with similar scores from a rich private school with well-connected parents. Those with privilege tend to overperform their ""true"" ability on things like standardized tests, while those with hardship tend to underperform their true ability. 

And like it or not, race itself carries privileges or burdens, so any race-blind method of measuring hardship or tenacity will necessarily miss some of the nuances. Hardship should be a significant factor in university admissions, and race is a significant factor in hardship.

**Intelligence, academic performance, and academic foundations have diminishing returns at the top.** There's no guarantee that the kid with a 1550 SAT will outperform the kid with the 1500 SAT once college starts. Or 10 years after college, when they're in the workforce. At a certain point, students simply exceed the threshold of what one needs to have in order to succeed at university, so that even higher scores are no longer all that predictive of future success.

With that in mind, the university admissions committees are going to be looking at a lot more qualified students than there are spots, so that dividing that group of qualified students might be better served by considering other criteria other than those that got them into the qualified category in the first place. In other words, it might be best to admit the qualified students with the most interesting back stories, who are most likely to contribute something new to the class, who have overcome the most significant hardships, rather than just subdividing the already qualified group into ""most qualified"" and ""less qualified."" So ""academic merit"" should be seen as a gate that all applicants must pass through, but once on the other side, the criteria can and should change to completely other things.

Besides, purely ranking based on ""merit"" gets strained when talking about where alumni/donors, athletes, the ""z list"" (where applicants are asked to reapply after taking a gap year), nontraditional students, and international students fit into the mix. Admission isn't just about merit (and merit is such a fuzzy concept), so any discussion of affirmative action needs to move away from the false dichotomy of merit versus diversity.","1"

I agree with everything you said about solely academic metrics being inadequate for satisfying the needs for society - people are more than just SAT scores or GPAs. However, our current application process already provides a lot of room for showing hardship. People in low socioeconomic status brackets can already write about the problems they faced growing up poor or having to work to provide for their family, or can choose to write about their experiences with police brutality, microaggressions, or racism if they feel like it was a fundamental part of their upbringing. Colleges already have a ""leadership"" and ""potential"" metric they optimize for - it just so happens that Asian people do well on them due to a cultural emphasis on education and hard work, and therefore are overrepresented in admissions.

When you say that racial diversity is a goal we should strive for, do you mean that all colleges should have a student body with exactly the same racial demographics as the United States? Does that mean all colleges should have a maximum of 3% of their student body as Asian, despite the fact that Asian culture places a much higher emphasis on education than American culture?

Asians are already discriminated against in other walks of life, through no fault of our own. Nobody demands that all movies have a 3% asian cast, the NBA or NFL has 3% Asian players, or 3% of US politicians are Asian. All of a sudden when it comes to education, the one aspect of society that Asians are overrepresented in due to our culture's emphasis on it, people demand that we start using race as a qualifying metric.

The debate on whether race as a standalone quality should be used to judge people is already largely settled in the United States. If you asked people whether they thought race should be considered in a judgement about someone's character, the large majority of Americans would say no - the civil rights act and california civil rights initiative proves it.","1_2"

No, any more than we should make sure that these California universities have a perfect population distribution of people from each zip code in California. But the schools do owe it to their students and to their community to make sure that major demographic groups aren't missing entirely from their student body. If UC Berkeley were to admit a class of students and not a single one of the students is from San Diego, then something has gone wrong, and the state-funded institution isn't properly serving the entirety of the state that funds it.

&gt; Nobody demands that all movies have a 3% asian cast, the NBA or NFL has 3% Asian players, or 3% of US politicians are Asian. 

No, but people do fight for the number to be ""not zero."" That's what I'm getting at. Even for a demographic that represents 3% of the population, proper representation requires a nonzero number of actors, athletes, politicians, judges, CEOs, police officers, doctors, teachers, etc. to hail from that demographic.

When Sally Ride was gearing up to be the first American woman in space, the NASA engineers asked her whether 100 tampons would be enough for her 7-day mission. That's a blind spot created by homogeneity. NASA didn't need for half of their engineers to be women to avoid that blind spot. They just needed one.

&gt; The debate on whether race as a standalone quality should be used to judge people is already largely settled in the United States.

Hardship comes in a lot of forms. And race is a significant component of it. Society isn't race blind, so hardship isn't race blind. A rich black person has qualitatively different struggles from a rich white person, or even a poor white person, while a poor black person has qualitatively different struggles than either. When defining hardship, should that population be analyzed as two separate groups (poor and rich) or four (poor and rich, black and white)? If we want an accurate reflection of what hardship actually means, consciously ignoring the racial/ethnic groupings is consciously ignoring one facet of a very real hardship (or privilege) that some live.

And the reason why hardship is an important component of college admissions, but not other parts of society, is because college admissions is about much more than just choosing the ""best"" person for a role.

Race is part of the human experience, and drives how we perceive the world and how the world perceives us. And all parts of the human experience should be fair game for consideration in college admissions.","1_2_1"

If that's all you ask for, the current system already satisfies that: according to this [source](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance), 26% of students at UCs identify as URMs.

&gt; If UC Berkeley were to admit a class of students and not a single one of the students is from San Diego, then something has gone wrong

Yup, but the solution to this problem isn't ""reserve a portion of student seats for students from San Diego"" or ""add a section where students can add their zip code so we can prioritize San Diegans"" The solution is look closely into **why** students from San Diego are underperforming, and treat the root cause of the problem, not the symptoms. Perhaps we could look into providing additional funding for K-12 schooling for San Diegan neighborhoods, or reimplement K-12 standards so San Diegans are better prepared for college.

&gt; Society isn't race blind, so hardship isn't race blind. A rich black person has qualitatively different struggles from a rich white person, or even a poor white person, while a poor black person has qualitatively different struggles than either.

That's true, but race is the simplest and one of the least descriptive metrics for diversity. People pay extra attention to it because it's the most obviously visible, but it struggles to maintain cohesion when examined more closely. Every single person has a different upbringing, and the core idea behind being against racism for me is that people should not be judged for factors beyond their control, like their skin color.

For example, ask any asian person how much they identify with another asian person. Perhaps they would have some similar cultural aspects - they might both celebrate the lunar new year, or might both joke about how their parents forced them to study more when they were kids. That's about it. I know as an asian person, I would identify much more closely with any fellow student from my high school than any of the 4.5 billion people in Asia, but in the section of the UC application that asks about race, I would be grouped together with those 4.5 billion people in a bucket labeled ""asian"".

Taking race into consideration in college applications is an inelegant facade of a solution that fails to solve the real problem of systemic racism that America has. College administrators want their college demographics to resemble those of the US so people can look at their demographics and pretend that the problem is solved. In reality, attempting to equalize outcomes will do nothing to address the fundamental problems disadvantaged minority communities suffer from. We can already see symptoms of this: black and hispanic people are oftentimes (sometimes justly, sometimes unjustly) regarded as less capable than their peers who graduate from the exact same university due to the lower admission standards they benefit from. In tech companies, female, black, or hispanic engineers are sometimes regarded as ""diversity"" candidates who received their job only because of their gender or the color of their skin. If the current trend of weak medical school admission standards for URMs continue, I bet we will see a trend in the future where black or URM doctors are trusted less than asian or white doctors because of their lower admission standards.

Without addressing the symptoms of the problems, and by equalizing for outcomes rather than for opportunity, we will eventually make racism a bigger problem than it already is - people will just pretend it's gone while minority communities continue to suffer.","1_2_1_1"

Well, there's a layer of complexity that comes from certain things being in the control of different people. The same people who make decisions about how to select applicants for admission into a university are *not* the same people who decide how to fund school lunch or day care or lead abatement, and might not be in the position to design k-12 curricula that can factor in the cultural reality that not every student has the same circumstances.

What universities and their admissions committees *can* do is decide what their role in society should be. Admissions isn't a ""solution"" to a ""problem,"" in a backwards looking way, but a forward-looking policy decision on what roles you want the graduates of your institution to play in the future. The same degree doesn't open the same doors for different people. That degree might mean one thing to a star athlete, to a Senator's kid, to an international student who wants to permanently immigrate to the U.S., to the prince of a foreign monarchy who will use that education and connections to rule back home, to the kid of poor rural farmers, etc. The applicants aren't fungible, interchangeable cogs in our society. That's why college admission isn't a prize for past performance, and why affirmative action isn't a solution to past discrimination.

&gt; Perhaps they would have some similar cultural aspects - they might both celebrate the lunar new year, or might both joke about how their parents forced them to study more when they were kids. That's about it.

When I was young, I primarily socialized with other Asians. Not just other Chinese American (and I grew up in a time and place when those Chinese Americans were basically separated into children of immigrants from Hong Kong and children of immigrants from Taiwan), but also Korean, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Thai kids. We were grouped together, both by external and internal social forces. That's a shared experience.

And the Asian immigrant experience has strong shared ties. By the time I got outside of my comfort zone and met a lot of children of white immigrants and black immigrants, the reality of growing up bilingual and having a foot in both worlds was very different for them than it was for me (and all my Korean, Vietnamese, other Asian friends).

So there's much more shared experience and common culture between Asian Americans than your comment seems to suggest.

And, in any event, I don't think anyone is advocating for a crude form of affirmative action where black applicants from Ethiopia are naively categorized in the same group as black applicants from Sacramento, or for Asian applicants from Taipei to be categorized in the same group as Asian applicants from Los Angeles. When I advocate for race to be a factor, I'm by no means pushing for race to be the only factor, or the biggest factor. Just a factor.","1_2_1_1_1"

That was my perspective, too, 16 years ago when I was getting into and when I was in college.

Sure, there are other aspects of systematic inequality that can be addressed in order to deal with root causes, but that shouldn't mean that we can't apply solutions throughout the system.

Upper caste Indians, who are disproportionately the ones who immigrate to the U.S., probably recognize that their families were already the ""elites"", and with a bit of progressive nudging could come to accept that they benefited from some unearned privilege so others deserve some extra help.

On the other hand, there aren't really any ""old money"" mainland Chinese people (as far as I know, maybe the revolution wasn't as thorough as I was led to believe), so Chinese immigrants might be more likely to see their accomplishments as entirely a result of their own hard work. If you feel like your success was entirely based on merit, it's harder to accept that other people deserve more help than you or your kids.

Then it gets shafted during the Age of Imperialism, sent all the way down, tore itself apart, had its own fun with Daddy Mao's plans and eventually came back on top to a place where it could contend on the world stage.

Again, entirely based on anecdotes and my own sights, but I feel like the old pride, the bruised ego and then the Chinese Dream success story had a lot of this reinvergerate of ""we were the best, we got bet and now we're the best again"".

Gary Gutting wrote an opinion in the NYTimes that argued for producing black professionals (excluding African immigrants). Beyond equity, it would also change norms. I would also add that it changes outcomes for society. In medicine, I think its definitely worthwhile and helps improve patient outcomes. While some may argue about lower quality, there are licensing steps to ensure that and some programs to make sure students meet those requirements (eg extra time in medical school, tutoring, etc) without dropping out. I think society needs more black doctors to help address the health disparity and affirmative action can help. 

There are also more and more support services like Questbridge that provide exam prep, admissions coaching, or help after admissions to stay in college. These arent formally considered affirmative action. Its become necessary because of the private services (I was recruited to help for grad school...lets just say it paid more per hour than grad school does.) 

Personally, I wouldnt mind seeing a forced integration system because I think its on the right track to make parents upset that their precious kid might sit next to someone from the next district over or be bused over there.

Anti-Asian discrimination in college admissions takes the form of retrofitting the definition of ""merit"" to favor white students over Asian students.

Right now the UCs already use [a 14 factor evaluation system](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/how-to-apply/applying-as-a-freshman/how-applications-are-reviewed.html) which includes immigrant/refugee status, family situations, and other socioeconomic factors, and if ACA 5 passes it will just add race as one of the factors to the many things they already consider. It won't establish a quota system as quota was already declared unconstitutional in 1978 by SCOTUS. Proponents of ACA 5 also advocate for data disaggregation which will help SEA, and many SEA groups also support affirmative action. 

In the long run ACA5 is just one of the many but necessary reforms. Divestment in higher education is what has been hurting Asian American student enrollment at the UCs the most, not affirmative action. The state of California is not keeping up with its promises in the Master Plan for Higher Education by providing enough higher education opportunities for qualified CA high school grads. Admission rate for Asian American students to UCs has been declining even though affirmative action has been banned since 1996 because investment in higher education system is not keeping up with the population demand despite the states immense wealth. Instead of blaming it on other groups and making it a zero sum game, why don't we fight for better opportunities for everyone and hold the government accountable?

Also stop telling me how this is going to lower admission standards. Last time I checked the course and GPA requirements are still the same for all groups, no exceptions.","12"

Your link itself claimed that white women are the biggest beneficiaries to Affirmative Action. This means that the system needs to be fixed first. Affirmative Action in university admission is good and should be supported only if it's not used to harm Asian applicants. Your links still haven't explained how there's actual research showing that Asian Americans will be more easily admitted in university thanks to AA. Or that there are actual moves by universities to apply AA in such a way that it doesn't decrease the chances for Asian applicants.

If they want to make more chances so that other minority groups can be accepted, that's great. But then take it away from white people, why the need to take it away from Asian applicants? Why not take it away from legacy applicants? Unless they make it clear and apparent that it won't decrease the chances for Asian applicants, this isn't really helping against white supremacy, just a way to make it more palatable to the masses.","13_2"

What makes me skeptical is that I doubt they'll implement it the right way. I think I am justified in feeling this way based on the fact that there haven't really been anything requiring that they would disaggregate the data- just that they will start looking at race. Ivy league style affirmative action still creates a class of elites, albeit a more diverse one only in skin color. 

I just don't think the white man has our best interests at hand to actually make an effective system without being mandated to. Will they actually take all the subtle nuances into account, subgroups of race, generation, income, jobs of parents, family history, ESL, etc. and actually use them to create a more equitable system, or will they claim they are but just treat this as picking colors from the home depot paint store? They have every incentive to pick the latter, and if so, then we'd stand more to benefit from the system of economic affirmative action.

They increase the amount of Black and Hispanic students admitted? Great!!! But not by taking away from white people's slots, and still maintaining legacy applications which is majority white. And certainly not by employing racist stereotypes and intentional lowering of Asian people's personality score. 

People really need to look long and hard at AA, and how it's a system that was made by white people at the helm.

Affirmative action has historically helped white people the most--specifically, white women.

The paper you linked shows that South Asians have (using the average for the time period) 2.82 CEOs per million whereas whites have 1.92. 

But, 74% of Indian-Americans have at least a college degree (33% bachelors, 40% graduate degree) compared to 33% of non-Hispanic whites (20.9% bachelors, 11.7% graduate). 

So Indians are about 46% more likely to be CEO compared to white people but 125% more likely to have at least a bachelors degree (and 233% more likely to have a graduate degree). That doesn't point to ""overrepresentation relative to whites"" in my eyes or arguably even overrepresentation overall.

* 107 million adults 25 and older have college degrees. (associates or higher)
* By your data, 3.1 million Indians have college degrees in 2017.
* 2.6% of CEOs were Indian vs. 2.9% of degree holders. Perhaps underrepresented on this naive calculation.
* Of course, there's heavy immigration coming in. No one immigrates and immediately becomes a CEO.  If you back up even 7 years (to 2010) in that paper, you get something like 2.6% of today's CEOs are Indian on 2.3% of 2010 college grads (overrepresented).
* 7 year backup of course is still too low. Realistically, it's 20+ years to become CEO after living in America (Satya at 24 years, Nooyi at 22, etc.).  More backup implies more overrepresentation relative to the initial pipeline.
* There's serious age bias here without strong controls - the non-working elderly population has lower educational attainment. Going by US census [data](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html), it's 46% of 25-30 years have college degrees.  51% of non-Hispanic whites and 75% of Asian alone (they don't disaggregate).  That would put the two ratios you calculated roughly in-line between Indian and white and factoring immigration biases probably imply Indians are actually more represented than whites.

Secondly, I'm not even sure if ""degree holders"" is the right control; it's heavily biased by immigration (you basically need a degree to immigrate here, but you can be a white collar worker without a degree).

The correct question is, among the US born population in the relevant workforce, across different age buckets, which groups are overrepresented? I'd be surprised if the order wasn't Indian slightly above white and much greater than East Asian.  It certainly felt that way from companies I've worked with.   The MBA pipeline data suggests this; do you have counter data that analyzes the native born pipeline?

&gt;East Asians strongly underperform relative to educational attainment which is a huge problem of course. But sometimes there is this narrative that Indian-Americans are totally fine and don't face workplace discrimination which is straight up false.

I think it depends on if the proponents of affirmative action sees Asian Americans as minorities or POC.

That doesn't mean that it may not serve Asians in communities where they are underrepresented in higher ed.

Yes and no - the law itself doesn't distinguish between affirmative action and racial discrimination. The legal test for affirmative action is the same test (strict scrutiny) as applied to any race-conscious policy. 

To pass strict scrutiny, there has to be a compelling government interest and narrowly tailored/least restrictive means to achieving that interest. Obviously, there is no compelling government interest in a policy that prefers whites to POC, which is why racial discrimination fails the test.

For affirmative action, IIRC the ""compelling government interest"" element is not that controversial. It's the ""narrowly tailored/least restrictive means"" test that gets more attention - whether other race-blind methods (income-based, top 10% of all high schools, etc.) would be effective.","5_2_1"

I think that if you can consider class and gender, and family background, and where applicants live, what kind of schools they went to, and so on, then it only makes sense to consider race as well.

When it comes to the fact that there are a limited number of seats, there's going to be collateral. I believe that if it leads to increasing access to historically marginalized groups, then, oh well, a few Asians didn't get in. But Harvard is already something like 25% Asian, and let's be honest - if you actually have a decent shot at Harvard, you're doing pretty good! Many Asian Americans in the past few decades have benefited from affirmative action policies, and wouldn't be where they are today if there weren't policies designed to increase access to underrepresented groups. There are still underrepresented Asians in higher education, like southeast Asians.

There's a difference between saying ""We don't want to pick you because you're Asian"" and ""We want to increase the numbers of X, and as a result some of the very good candidates who happen to be Asian won't get the spot."" I would definitely be opposed to the first thing, but I do support the second thing. I believe that affirmative action has done much more good than harm to Asian Americans, but just as well-qualified white applicants gave way to make space for some non-white applicants, overrepresented Asian groups will, sooner or later, have to give way to allow some spots for other underrepresented groups.","5_2_4_1"

Galvanizing through ethnic social media platforms like WeChat, conservative Chinese immigrants effectively mobilized to protest against affirmative action (Rong 2019; Wong 2018). Their successful mobilization within and outside Chinese ethnic communities led to a nearly 50 percent drop in support for affirmative action among Chinese American registered voters between 2012 and 2016 (Ramakrishnan and Wong 2018).

We all know what the point of the lawsuit is. Equality of treatment and no unspoken rules against Asians, and thereby allowing deserving people with high scores to get into the best schools. Your entire attack against my position is based on that single premise.

I think most people who went to Harvard would say yes.","13_1_2_3_1"

For example, an employer that has a workforce of 70% White, 20% Black, 8% Hispanic, and 2% Asian could be found to be discriminating against Asians because  Asians make up nearly 6% of the nations population. This lower level quality of statistical evidence doesn't provide proof that such an employer is discriminating against Asians. But the Harvard case opens the door for such to be sufficient.

Regardless of what issue, we should all be concerned about what quality of evidence the courts are using to determine if there is a racial bias.

Does the fact that my White co-workers make more than me enough to prove that our employer has a racial bias even though they all have at least 10 more years of work experience than me?

Does that fact that Asians on average score better on the ACT and SAT than African Americans and Hispanics mean that the tests are racially biased?

Does the fact that on average women make less  than men enough to prove wage discrimination?

Does the fact the McDonalds hires more people under 65 than over 65 mean its involved in age discrimination?

If we are willing to lower the quality of evidence to prove discrimination, are we also willing to lower the quality of evidence to determine guilt in criminal cases?

To many people are basing their opinions on the case without even having gone through the evidence. Its sad so many are willing to cast judgement that way.  It makes me wonder how much longer the courts will require evidence at all and instead simply rely on popular opinion.","13_3_1"

SFFA is basically arguing that Harvard's admission policy discriminates against Asians and favors Blacks and Hispanics even though Asians make up nearly 14% of the undergraduate student body while Black and Hispanics make up 10% and 6% of student body respectively. 

If it wasn't for this policy of favoring Blacks and Hispanics over Asians, SFFA is claiming that Harvard's  Asian undergraduate student population would be greater than 14%.

To establish this, the analysis conducted by Prof. Arcidiacono excludes non-academic metrics such as high school quality, economic disadvantage, and personal disadvantage. The analysis conducted by Prof. Card which includes such factors, finds that Harvards policy does not favor Blacks and Hispanics over Asians. Prof. Card's analysis is also supported by the countries foremost experts on the matter on race and education. (Full disclosure: One of those experts that signed the amicus brief in support of Prof. Cards analysis was my graduate thesis advisor).

Also, it is important to remember that SFFA doesn't so much have problem with Harvard having a policy that favors racial minorities.  Rather, its problem is that Harvard policy favors certain racial minorities more than others when it should favor all racial minorities equally.","13_3_1_1_1"

I don't know how important it is for me to post something, but maybe this is just my way of mentally processing. 

One of the things that always comes to mind is how damaging the word ""Asian"" really is. Yes, there are similarities and bits of borrowed culture across different peoples of Asia, but to lump us all together just always rubs me the wrong way. I will always claim my Hmong ethnicity and culture before ""Asian."" At the same time, I do think there's a sense of camaraderie to be had between the peoples of Asia. 

Something I constantly question, though, is how much of this camaraderie is natural and how much of it is manufactured by White America. And yes, I do say ""White"" America because the roots of ""orientalism"" trail back to French and British folk who would then become the people to populate the US. Historically speaking, the Hmong people have been and continue to be oppressed in most Asian countries. There's even history of the enslavement of Hmong people in parts of China. I don't think this is unique to Hmong people, I think this is pretty common for all ethnic and cultural minorities of Asia--such as the Rohingya of Myanmar for example. I'm so torn. Because while I do appreciate that I can put that history aside given the new opportunities available in America, does it also mean I'm buying into the White narrative that *granted* ""honorary whiteness"" to Asians even before my people arrived here? 

And then when this feeds into the whole college system, I'm then led to continually question our system of higher education which was designed by white people for white people. While attempts have been made to alleviate the cultural-centrism of education, there are still things that people either can't let go of or choose not to let go of because we haven't found a better way yet. 

I believe in the power of affirmative action, but I also don't think it's enough. I don't think it's enough to just push someone into school because of the color of their skin. I went to UW-Madison, a huge top 10 public school, and getting into the school was only one hurdle. The culture of the campus and academics weren't designed for the success of all, and I struggled immensely without that cultural knowledge. As a teacher, I believe to my core that education is inherently flawed and needs major reform to become more culturally sensitive and culturally relevant to best serve the current and future American populations. I don't have clear answers for this, but it's something I do think about often. 

One of my greatest challenges is encouraging my students of color to go to college. Yes, I want all of them to have the opportunity to go to college and then have the opportunities that come with a college degree (career choices, grad school, etc.), but also I know college is really freakin hard for kids of color who go through 12 years of school often not knowing how to ""play the game"" and see education as an equalizer. I find myself having to teach kids how to ""play the game,"" and it kinda feels dirty because I see maybe 20 kids of color off to college versus the thousands across the US. How the heck to I help them all? And maybe I'm foolish to think I can or that I should help them all, but we need to. We need to help *every* student succeed, and that only comes from changes to the broken system.","2"

This case is being tried before [Allison Burroughs](https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/burroughs-allison-dale), an Obama nominee to the Massachusetts US District Court.

Also, this part gets me thinking about Asian culture and legacy admissions:

&gt; Roughly 30 percent of the seats in every Harvard class go to athletes, legacies, the children of faculty and applicants on the deans interest list, composed in large part of the children of donors. This group, called A.L.D.C.s, get into Harvard at a rate of about 45 percent, far greater than the 5 percent rate for the rest of the pool. Two percent of Asian applicants are A.L.D.C.s. The zero-sum view of this arrangement never asks why the spots for more Asian kids couldnt come from the pool of A.L.D.C.s.

Contrast it with this anecdote about the father of the main speaker in this story:

&gt; Alexs father, Qiao, immigrated to the United States in 1994, when he was 21. He grew up in poverty in the countryside of Fujian Province. He describes his hometown as a thoroughly corrupt place where people like him could not get anything done without bribing a local official.

For the most part, Asian parents have been ""play by the rules and work hard to get ahead"" types. The cold reality that Ivy League schools are not purely meritocracies but rather insular tribes for ""the right"" kinds of ""the best"" (white, wealthy, from posh parts of the country and old money) inspires certain opposition to affirmative action from Asian activists. Can anyone name any buildings in elite universities named after Asian-Americans? Let me try:

* Stanford: The [Li Ka Shing Center](https://conferencecenter.stanford.edu/) at the medical school, named after [a Hong Kong billionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ka-shing).

* Berkeley: The business school [has a learning lab](https://newbuilding.haas.berkeley.edu/). named after Connie &amp; Kevin Chou. [Kevin Chou](https://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/just-in/2019-06-12/game-changer-introducing-cal-alumnus-year-kevin-chou) is a 2002 alum and video game developer whose parents are Taiwanese immigrants. However most of the Asian ""naming rights"" have gone to overseas Asians not Asian Americans. The [Tang Center](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/home) for health services, which [came from a $4m donation from the Tang Foundation](https://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/96legacy/chron.html) in honor of [Jack Tang](https://asiasociety.org/hong-kong/memory-dr-jack-tang-chi-chien), a Hong Kong entrepreneur. [Tan Hall](https://dac.berkeley.edu/tan-hall), part of the disability compliance center, was named after [Tan Kah Kee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tan_Kah_Kee), who had died over 35 years earlier and whose philanthropy was mostly in China and Singapore during his lifetime. The [Woo Hon Fai Hall](https://dac.berkeley.edu/woo-hon-fai-hall) in the same area was [donated by his son](https://news.berkeley.edu/2011/12/19/hong-kong-businessman-honors-father-woo-hon-fai-with-major-gift-to-uc-berkeley/) who was the architect behind the university's art museum and film archive.

As if that weren't bad enough, these admissions officers sit as the judges in these Olympic Games for which there are no written rules, and they ask us to simply trust in their good judgment. Meanwhile, these judges have proven themselves untrustworthy time and time again (fighting to keep out Jews in the past and retaining policies to benefit the privileged). And of course, no matter how you judge the Oppression Olympics, there is no reasonable calculation that would say that white people are more oppressed than Asians.

The short of it is that holistic admissions gives admissions officers a power that no one should have, really. The opacity of the process reduces the whole thing to, ""Trust us. We're the good guys.""

On the other hand, I'm also not a fan of the so-called ""objective meritocratic"" approach either, in part because I do believe in the goals of diversity and affirmative action. I don't know what the answer is, but I do feel strongly that the status quo is bullshit.","7"

In case you thought this guy's name was familiar, here's where you may seen it before: an October 2018 article titled [Michael Wang Didn't Get Into Harvard. He Thinks It's Because He's Asian.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/estherwang/chinese-americans-harvard-affirmative-action-asian-americans)

ICYMI, here's the sub's past discussion of this article: [https://old.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9o6mrl/michael\_wang\_didnt\_get\_into\_harvard\_he\_thinks\_its/](https://old.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9o6mrl/michael_wang_didnt_get_into_harvard_he_thinks_its/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

And here are some of the positions Michael chose to take, which had me going [u serious, brah??](https://media.giphy.com/media/tITrNs91St95hYoOoC/giphy.gif)

&gt;Michael told me he recognizes the importance of racial diversity. Being stuck on a \[predominantly\] white campus made me feel bad too, he said, recalling his time at Williams. Yet both he and his father seem comfortable with the prospect of having fewer black and Latino students on campus  the [likely outcome](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/at-elite-colleges-racial-diversity-requires-affirmative-action.html) if race-based affirmative action were eliminated  if it means that Asian students benefit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Are they really working hard like Asians? Jeff posed. I asked him if the idea of a majority Asian American student body gave him pause. Whats wrong with that? he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ultimately, college admission is a zero-sum game, Michael said. As he put it, Someone has to lose for someone else to win.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Blum is an ally in this fight for equality, Michael Wang told me. He had initially reached out to Blum as he was researching Abigail Fishers case, and theyve stayed in touch. **Some of his stances, like his gutting of the Voting Rights Act, give Michael pause. But I think as long as the end goal is good, I dont mind it as much, he said.**

Judging by his comment for NYT, seems like Michael's become more cautious about what he says and is less explicit about his support for Blum and SFFA. But reading between the lines of his comment, I don't think his views have changed much, if at all. He's still young so I was hoping he'd show some growth.

&gt;Its worth asking if a white student, who did not bear the stereotype of the shy Asian who only hangs out with other Asians, would need to credibly claim to want to make friends across multiple social groups. And while its difficult to read too much into such brief notes, Sallys top personality score seemed to come from the fact that she broke the stereotype and wouldnt just be quiet and self-segregated. If this is Harvards idea of diversity, its a white-down vision that rewards students for acting, in essence, more like wealthy white kids.  
&gt;  
&gt;But the emphasis on the essay revealed a much more troubling standard. Harvard, in essence, is saying that if you want your race to count, you need to prove to us why it matters. Or perhaps, to be more precise, when you write an essay to present who you are to the most prestigious college in the country, you should reduce your life to a moment of trauma.

Asian-Americans basically have to prove that they're not the stereotypical, ""grade-grubbing"" (as Kang describes it), quiet, studious, STEM-focused Asian-American student to do well on the personality score. Alum interviewers might already have an unconscious bias of Asian-American students being like that and looking for ways that the candidates adhere to that stereotype.

This brings to mind sociologist Annette Lareau's book ""Unequal Childhoods"". She mentions that children from more privileged backgrounds are raised to question authority since they see their parents doing so whereas children from less privileged backgrounds are taught to keep their heads down. Children from the former group would rank higher on Harvard's personality score since they would be ""exhibiting intellectual curiosity"" (i.e. not just accepting what an authority figure tells you as truth).","15"

Affirmative action at the federal and state levels only notes that public institutions (and entities receiving funds from governments, at risk of withdrawal of public funds) cannot provide preferential treatment or discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sex, and so forth. The fact that federal, state, or municipality funds can be allocated according to other characteristics (e.g. small business) is not an aspect of affirmative action. Indeed, these funds can be allocated however these institutions wish them to be, as long as they do not discriminate against the individuals receiving those funds (again, race, creed, color, sex).

It's an important difference, and I think you are conflating allocation of public resources based on certain goals (e.g. to encourage small businesses with public resources or another example may be to fund early-stage researchers with NIH grants) with affirmative action, which are two entirely and very different separate notions.

I also find it interesting that you, as a Cal grad, and presumably an Asian American, are against affirmative action on a collegiate level. If proposition 209 was enforced state-wide, the Asian American population at top privates would probably be similar to UCLA and Cal's rate of 40% than the current \~20-25%.","19_1"

From a legal perspective, there's not much to talk about. Unlike race, legacy status (or lack thereof) isn't a legally protected class. Harvard could openly admit to discriminating against non-legacies and still wouldn't be breaking any laws.

Nor do I even see conceptually why Harvard would be moved by public opinion. It's one thing when you apply social pressure to elected officials or everyday companies. We can pressure politicians because they need our votes to stay in office. We can pressure Facebook for being complicit in election meddling and misinformation because they need us as users to stay relevant.

Harvard's power isn't a product of their popularity with the everyday person.

Using Asian Americans to fight affirmative action is pretty much a ploy to attack minorities.  Even the case against Harvard is brought about by conservative anti AA activists who guess what are not Asian Americans.

But, as an Asian, I also know that people like me will have an easier time getting into elite universities without the current iteration of affirmative action. I don't see why I shouldn't look out for my own self-interest, especially given that I don't see any evidence of people on either side of the debate doing so.

And I'll believe that a serious legal challenge exists when I see it. The last time anyone on the Supreme Court addressed it was Thomas (who is neither a legacy nor supportive of legacy admissions):

&gt;	The Equal Protection Clause does not, however, prohibit the use of unseemly legacy preferences or many other kinds of arbitrary admissions procedures.

Alex is also the vice president of technology for the Bronx Science chapter of the National Honor Society, the director of graphics and marketing for TeenHacks L.I. (the first hackathon for teens in Long Island), a member of the cross-country team, the vice president of the schools painting club, the president of the Get Your Life Together club (visitors from various businesses come talk to students) and the senator for his homeroom. In his free time, he plays Pokémon and goes on long jogs through Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx. His parents, Qiao and Su, emigrated from China in the 90s and worked their way through commuter colleges in Queens. They live along with Alexs little brother in a modest apartment in outer Queens. In the specific yet ultimately abstracted and perhaps inhuman calculations particular to selective college admissions, Alex is a first-generation (considered a plus), middle-class (minus) Chinese-American (minus, arguably) with two college-educated parents (minus) from a major American city (minus) with aspirations to study either computer science (minus, given all the Asians who want to go into STEM disciplines) or political science (plus).

When I first met him in early August 2018, we struggled to find a time to meet up to talk about his thoughts on affirmative action and its effect on Asian-American students. Deep into the summer vacation before his last year of high school, Alex had been interning in the office of Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou while also completing a study on congressional legislators with a professor at New York University. There just was no time.

After Alex canceled our first agreed-upon date, I told him that in addition to writing for The New York Times Magazine, I was also writing a book, ran a small production company and had an 18-month-old daughter. And yet, despite these various jobs (as well as the fact that I wasnt on summer vacation), I could meet him on any day and at any time for however long he pleased. My flexible schedule wasnt a favor to him but simply a reflection of the life of a relatively productive adult.

Well, thats you, Alex said, a bit scornfully.

We finally settled on a meeting in the financial district. Alex suggested a Dunkin Donuts exactly one door down from his internship office. When I arrived, I saw that it had no tables or booths, just three stools pushed up against the front window. I was hungry and slightly irritated, so I texted him and said Id meet him at a Cuban lunch counter nearby. He walked through the front door a moment later  thin, with short-cropped hair, a neatly tucked button-up shirt and creaseless pants. He had a look of mild agitation about him, one that never really subsided. We shook hands.

This is my list of priorities for the summer, he said, opening a document on his phone. You can see the sociology study is way up high because its really important to me, and cross-country is less high but still important.

Do you enjoy running? I asked.

Sometimes, he said. Do you want to see my list of colleges?
I believe the existence of affirmative action reflects the countless historical injustices that have led to such a complex situation, and any single person or perspective, much less a short photo caption, cant possibly capture its nuances. But I absolutely think that our generations willingness to discuss the hard topics of race and class and privilege will eventually lead to a satisfactory solution for everybody, even beyond college admissions.
He pulled up a spreadsheet on his phone with the names of 11 colleges listed in color-coded columns. So, Binghamton and Rochester are the safeties, which is great, because Id be totally thrilled to go to both. Carnegie Mellon and Rice are matches where Im pretty sure I can get in. And these schools in red are my reaches. Yale, M.I.T., Cornell, Princeton, Stanford, Vanderbilt and Brown.

Would you really be happy going to Binghamton or Rochester? I asked.

Yes, because the value would be there for the price Ill end up paying. Theyre great schools and cheap.I see Harvard isnt on your list, I said. Are you worried itll be impossible because of ... you know.

Im applying to Yale.

Sure, I said. But Harvard is Harvard.

Yes, and Yale is Yale, he said.

Do you want to go to Yale? I asked.

Define want,  he said.

It went on like this for a while. After a brief discussion about his internship and what it taught him about the importance of local political representation, I finally asked him how he felt about affirmative action.

Its complicated, Alex said. I understand why it exists and why it might be necessary to create the society we all want, he went on. But I also understand there are ideas that make it seem like Asians arent discriminated against at all.

What ideas? I asked.

He gave me a look that communicated his deep, and perhaps justified, frustration with me. These ideas, I gathered, had been implicit in every conversation Alex had ever had about college admissions, but they rarely found clear expression. So how do you feel about affirmative action? I asked again.

I understand the thinking behind affirmative action, but I just wish the message wasnt that Asians are all so privileged and rich and buying their way into colleges, he said, referring to the perception that Asian parents in effect buy their kids test scores through expensive preparation programs and private tutoring. And I wish that it didnt mean that my work didnt count in the same way as other peoples work.
This was an unsatisfying answer but not an uncommon one. In 2014, an organization with the cryptic name Students for Fair Admissions filed a lawsuit against Harvard College on behalf of Asian-American applicants who claimed they had been victims of discrimination and bias. In August 2018, the Department of Justice filed a statement of interest in the case, arguing against Harvards motion to dismiss it and claiming that Harvard has failed to prove that its use of race survives strict scrutiny. Following all the attention that action received, I began asking Asian kids across the country about affirmative action, which was widely seen to be the real issue.

The case, which after a lengthy trial last autumn is expected to be decided by Judge Allison D. Burroughs sometime in the coming months, has pushed many Asian-Americans into a spotlight they had eagerly been avoiding for the past 20 years. The students felt uneasy, and perhaps unworthy, discussing race, especially within a context where they were personally implicated. As such, many refused to go on the record for fear of saying something controversial. The opinions ranged from We shouldnt be punished for doing well to We all need to sacrifice to make a better, more just society. Most of them said they had always known it would be harder for them to get into college, but only a few called this an injustice. There was nothing approaching a consensus, but they were, for the most part, extremely conflicted and embarrassed by the whole business.

Their internal conflict, however inchoate and strangled by euphemism, paled next to the angst of what Ill call the upwardly mobile Asian-American population  the sort of people who had attended Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Stanford and who, in other circumstances, would have publicly and loudly supported any goal pursued in the name of diversity. Over the past year, I found myself constantly talking about the Harvard case with this cohort, many of them friends and colleagues, not only for journalistic reasons but also because it was always on our minds. These conversations usually started with perfunctory statements like Listen, I know Im not supposed to say this or This is a complicated issue, but they almost always ended with a surprisingly declarative conclusion.

Look, I support Harvards right to pursue the diversity they want, said one Asian-American who described herself as a staunch supporter of affirmative action. But of course they discriminate against Asian kids.On the first day of the trial for Students for Fair Admissions (S.F.F.A.) v. the President and Fellows of Harvard College, which took place over three weeks in late 2018, a problem presented itself: It was almost impossible to figure out who or what, exactly, was on trial. In his opening statement, Adam K. Mortara, the lead attorney for S.F.F.A. and a former clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, declared, The future of affirmative action is not on trial. Then he added, Diversity and its benefits are not on trial. This came as news to the dozens of Asian-American activists who had traveled to Boston to support the lawsuit, as well as the gallery of reporters who piled into the stiff, unyielding press benches in Courtroom 17 of the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston with assignments to cover the affirmative-action trial.","25"

Every now and then he would jot down something in a notebook and then return to watching dispassionately with his hands folded in his lap. This was Edward Blum, the 67-year-old president of S.F.F.A., and paradoxically enough, given that he is a white man with no direct connection to the school, the only person named on the side of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Harvard. Blum is not a lawyer or a politician, but he may be the most influential and effective opponent in the country of any progressive policy that tries to distinguish people by race and ethnicity. He exerts influence, in large part, because of his connections to wealthy conservative donors, but also from an indefatigable resolve to flood the legal system with lawsuits, some of which eventually make it to the Supreme Court.

In addition to S.F.F.A., Blum also heads the Project on Fair Representation, the litigation fund behind Fisher v. the University of Texas at Austin, the last major challenge to affirmative action to reach the Supreme Court, in which Abigail Fisher, a white woman, was one of two women claiming to have been rejected from a spot she deserved because of preferences given to people of color. On two separate occasions within the last decade, Blum and his attorneys argued that the University of Texas was placing too much weight on race in nonautomatic admissions. Blum lost this challenge in 2016, but he has also done quite a bit of winning: In 2013, he won a landmark decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the key provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by effectively ending federal oversight of elections. Blum would not be taking the stand in the Harvard case.

A sweeping elimination of affirmative action still requires the cooperation of the Supreme Court, which was responsible for another odd dynamic in the trial. A vast majority of the testimony and argumentation was about Asian-Americans, but the actual lawsuit unfolded in a way that didnt have much to do with Asians at all. The inevitability of an appeal, which would then raise the stakes, made the entire trial feel somewhat like an opening act. At the #DefendDiversity rally at the start of the trial, Jessica Tang, president of the Boston Teachers Union and a Harvard alumna, said that Edward Blum is not a friend to Asian-Americans and accused him of using Asian-Americans as pawns in a vile legal game. S.F.F.A. was making three broad claims:

One: Harvards use of racial preferences far exceeded the Supreme Courts allowance of race as one, nonpredominant factor in a system designed to consider each applicant as an individual, as Justice Anthony Kennedy described it in Grutter v. Bollinger in 2003. A landmark affirmative-action ruling, it involved the University of Michigan Law School and upheld the principle that race is only supposed to be a plus that is considered when two applicants are otherwise indistinguishable. In those instances, race can be a tip that allows a university to seek the diversity it desires.

Two: Harvard, by keeping black, Latino and Asian admissions rates at a relatively steady equilibrium, despite demographic changes in its applicant pool, had created a de facto quota system. Quotas have been illegal since the Supreme Courts 1978 decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the first major challenge to affirmative action in higher education.

Three: Harvard had not adequately explored race-neutral alternatives required by the legal parameters of affirmative action. This requirement was reaffirmed in Fisher v. University of Texas, allowing a school to consider an applicants race only when no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.

Despite what Mortara said about affirmative action not being on trial, S.F.F.A. has been extremely forthright about its expectation that regardless of Burroughss decision, it will eventually be arguing in front of the Supreme Court. Over the course of the past year, I asked Blum on a few occasions what he hoped to get out of all this. His stance never changed. His mission, he told me again in August, is to remove race from college admissions: We believe that a students skin color or ethnic heritage should not be used to help or harm that students prospects of being admitted to a college or university. When I asked if the ultimate goal, then, was to end racial preferences not only in college admissions but also in all parts of the law, Blum said: Yes! Absolutely. I wont deny it.
To get to the Supreme Court, S.F.F.A. needed to justify the lawsuit both in the courtroom and to the public. According to Blum, Abigail Fisher, the daughter of a family friend, had suffered greatly from her years of national attention as a result of her case against the University of Texas. To avoid putting another young person through the same thing and to bring a fresh angle to the fight, Blum and his attorneys decided to represent an anonymous and amorphous group of plaintiffs. (Every request I made to talk to any of these unnamed persons was denied by S.F.F.A.s attorneys.) They chose, instead, to build a case out of spreadsheets and statistical data obtained through pretrial discovery, which in turn set up something of a phantom showdown: Students were discussed almost entirely through the abstraction of test scores, grades and extracurricular accomplishments. In their opening and closing statements, the attorneys for S.F.F.A. went through charts and spreadsheets, many of which were centered on something called the personal rating, a portion of Harvards application review that judges traits like courage, openness to new ideas and people and effervescence.Harvard, and many other institutions of higher education throughout the country, could not accomplish its mission of educating citizens and citizen leaders of the world without a diverse student body. As a first-generation, low-income Vietnamese-American college student, I refuse to allow S.F.F.A. to paint Asian-Americans with a broad stroke. I refuse to be used as a tool to further divide communities of color.
Their charts showed that Asian-American applicants outperformed white applicants in academics and extracurriculars and lagged behind in athletics and legacy considerations. When it came to the personal rating, Asian applicants rated significantly worse. Harvard never convincingly explained or contested the disparity.

Harvards defense, argued by Bill Lee, a 69-year-old Chinese-American attorney and a graduate of the class of 1972, was mostly predictable, if not entirely coherent. On one front, Harvard resorted to bureaucratic denial: It claimed that every piece of information, however damning, had to be placed within the context of the entire admissions process. And while Lee took great pains to detail how an application went through an initial reader and then an alumni interviewer and then a subcommittee and then the final 40-person committee, he never addressed the specifics of how decisions were made, except to say that the committee considered the whole person. In the end, the only definitive, knowable thing about the admissions process was that race was said to be only one small part of an opaque process.

On the other front, Harvard and its allies went on an ideological offensive. The multicultural and empathetic vision of the country  represented on Harvards side by lawyers of all races and a steady stream of Asian, black and Latino students who gave testimony about why they, despite less than perfect test scores and G.P.A.s, deserved to be on campus  would not be possible without the tireless efforts of places like the Harvard admissions office to change the face of elite society in America. Lee ended his opening statement with a personal anecdote: Forty-two years earlier, when he argued his first case in front of a federal judge, every person in the courtroom, save the deputy, was a white man. Look around the courtroom today, Lee said. Many institutions, many people have contributed and worked tirelessly to make this happen. Among them are colleges and universities.

This could easily have been seen as a shot at S.F.F.A.s cross-examining lawyers, who were all white. But Harvards story made even less sense than S.F.F.A.s. The array of amicus speakers gave breathless testimony about the dangers of gaslighting and the crippling self-doubt that comes with being told that your feelings of alienation and racial othering are all imagined or not worthy of concern. Then Lee stood up and told the judge that S.F.F.A.s own claims of implicit racial bias were outrageous, because Harvard admissions were an unknowably complicated, nuanced and sensitive process that involved 40 thoroughly trained people.","25_2"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cwk0vc/where_does_affirmative_action_leave_asianamericans/","unkle","2019-08-28",1566995022,9,9,0,0,"Lee and the Harvard admissions officers who were called to the stand also talked about the schools endlessly adjustable process, which could take factors like standardized test scores and G.P.A.s and place them within the proper context. The goal in all this, of course, was to root out systemic racism and relative privilege. But when it came to explaining away the disparities in the personal rating, Harvard presented years of data showing that Asian-American applicants, despite superior academic and extracurricular ratings, uniformly received worse recommendations from their teachers and guidance counselors. Lee did not extrapolate on what this might mean, but there was really only one possible conclusion to draw: If there was bias in the personal ratings, it came from the teachers and guidance counselors, not from Harvards admissions officers. And Harvard, despite its complex and sensitive system calibrated to ferret out and correct bias, apparently took these teachers and guidance counselors at their word  Asian students, year after year, were just a bit less personally appealing than white students and significantly less personally appealing than those who were black or Latino.

When Mortara and S.F.F.A.s other attorneys asked Harvard admissions officers on the stand if they believed Asian applicants had less desirable traits than their white counterparts, they, of course, said no, they did not.

From a letter to The Harvard Crimson by a student named David A. Karnes, arguing against affirmative action for Asian-American applicants:

Current U.S. Census figures show that Asian-Americans today penetrate all income levels and, in general, have attained an above-average standard of living. The barriers to equality which did indeed exist in the past for this group have largely vanished.

And a rebuttal, a few weeks later, from a student named Charles D. Toy:

Mr. Karnes adheres to the same misconception about Asian-Americans which has plagued them since intelligent people began to recognize and repudiate the savagery of official discrimination. Because he now perceives some ostensible penetration by Asian-Americans into various social and economic levels, Mr. Karnes concludes that most Asian-Americans no longer suffer the oppression of their status as a minority in this country.

These two letters were published in the fall of 1976. Earlier that semester, Josephine M. Lok and Bet Har Wong, Asian-American freshmen roommates at Radcliffe, tried to attend an orientation banquet for minority students and found that they were not among the invitees. In a lengthy article about the beginning of the Asian-American student movement at Harvard published in March of this year in The Crimson, Lok said she didnt really make a big deal of the omission because we didnt have that whole awareness. But other Asian-American students on campus saw the incident as representative of their unseen, and largely unwelcome, presence there. This stood in direct contrast with federal law at the time; in 1977, for example, the Department of Labor designated minority groups as consisting of negroes, Spanish-speaking, Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.

According to the article describing Wong and Loks strange rejection, after a group of Asian students confronted Fred Jewett, the dean of admissions, he told The Crimson in 1976 that Harvard did not count Asians as minorities because their enrollment numbers exceeded their share of the general American population. The demographics of the Harvard applicant pool, in other words, overruled everything else, whether common sense or the lived realities of many of the Asian students who attended Harvard.

The case has been divisive, but its brought to light a lot of important issues like meritocracy and the model-minority myth. And for a lot of Asians, I think its opened up their eyes about how to possibly connect with other minority groups.
These deliberations over race and privilege did not take place in a vacuum. In 1975, just a year before Wong and Lok were turned away from the minority-students banquet, Allan Bakke, a 35-year-old white man, was rejected for the second time by the medical school at the University of California, Davis. At the time, under a transparent affirmative-action policy, the school had reserved 16 of each classs 100 spots for a special admissions program that considered the applications of economically and/or educationally disadvantaged students. Those applicants deemed disadvantaged were evaluated by a separate committee with different standards. After Bakke sued U.C. Davis, a California court ruled that the schools program violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which prohibits racial discrimination. In 1978, the Supreme Court agreed that Bakke had been discriminated against.

In the courts decision in Bakke, Justice Lewis F. Powell cited Harvards admissions plan as the paragon of how diversity could be pursued in college admissions  because the school acknowledged, he wrote, that a farm boy from Idaho can bring something to Harvard College that a Bostonian cannot offer. Similarly, a black student can usually bring something that a white person cannot offer. The Bakke ruling meant that explicit quotas were unconstitutional, but when confronted with two equally qualified students, a school could give a tip to the one who could bring his or her unique regional or racial flavor to the colleges melting pot.

The spiritual language of affirmative action  to remedy the nations sins and to help underprivileged minorities who had been the victims of generational oppression  fell out of the legal conversation around affirmative action, mostly because any talk of giving a leg up to a certain number of students sounded too much like a quota system. Diversity became the new justification for considering a students race. It was no longer about righting historys wrongs or ending poverty. It was now about the something a student from a different background could bring to campus.

In 1988, William Bradford Reynolds, who was an assistant attorney general and chief of the civil rights division in the Reagan administrations Justice Department, spoke at a symposium on Asian-American university admissions sponsored by Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, a Democrat. By this point, official complaints of discrimination had been filed by Asian-American students at several top universities. In 1984, after a lengthy internal review, Brown University concluded that Asian-American applicants had been treated unfairly. By the time Reynolds took the stage to give his remarks, the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education had begun investigating admissions at several schools, including Harvard and U.C.L.A.

Until Reynoldss speech, the question of discrimination against Asian applicants had not been explicitly placed within the context of affirmative action, at least not by someone in such a prominent position. But he noted substantial statistical evidence that Asian-Americans faced higher hurdles than academically less qualified candidates of other races, and he added that rejection of such applicants ironically appears to be driven by the universities affirmative-action policies aimed at favoring other, preferred racial minorities. In this formulation, Asian students were being pitted against other minority groups for scarce, precious opportunities.","25_2_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cwk0vc/where_does_affirmative_action_leave_asianamericans/","unkle","2019-08-28",1566995070,10,10,0,0,"Over the next two years, the rules of the racial zero-sum game of college admissions took shape. The solidarity movements that started at Harvard in the late 70s were supplanted by an uneasy coalition of conservative white politicians, writers and attorneys and Asian-American legal activists. In 1990, according to a lengthy study by Dana Y. Takagi, a professor at U.C. Santa Cruz, the Office of Civil Rights opened an investigation into whether white applicants had been discriminated against at U.C. Berkeley. One of the original complainants was Arthur Hu, a Chinese-American software programmer who, using data made public by the school, had painstakingly charted the test scores and academic credentials of black, white and Asian applicants.

Thirty years after Reynoldss speech, Students for Fair Admissions revisited the 1988 playbook and filed its lawsuit against Harvard, claiming that its admissions process had discriminated against Asian applicants. During that time, the Asian population in the United States has grown to more than 21 million in 2016 from roughly 3.5 million in 1980, and a relatively narrowly defined group that used to apply mostly to Chinese and Japanese immigrants has been expanded to include everyone from the Hmong people to Koreans to South Asians. Attempts to corral all these peoples into one monolithic identity have become increasingly harder to reconcile. Asians are found throughout the socioeconomic spectrum. If its a silly endeavor to quantify racial oppression, its also absurd to equate the experience of a Sikh kid in Wisconsin with that of a Korean-American kid in Los Angeles.

And yet, when it comes to college admissions at elite schools, the conversation seems stuck in the past. None of the underlying questions have changed since Wong and Lok were turned away from that freshman banquet. Are Asians actually minorities? And if diversity  whatever that means  is the goal of affirmative action, how many Asians does a school really want on campus?

Im a bit embarrassed to admit that I found Alex somewhat annoying at first. If I had been an alumni interviewer tasked with rating Alexs personality on a scale of 1 to 6, with 1 being a student who showed unusual intellectual curiosity, grit and effervescence and 6 being a mumbling 4chan troll who would be a nightmare for his roommates, I would have given Alex a solid 3.

In my early 20s, I taught high-school English, and like many teachers, I grew to see students as types that recur over and over again. Alex struck me as the sort who would turn in perfectly competent papers about the assigned book, whether by Hawthorne or Ellison or Salinger, but wouldnt engage with the text on an emotional level, at least not in the Dangerous Minds way that most young teachers want to see. And so I saw in Alex the stereotype of the Asian grade-grubbing machine. His résumé seemed filled with dubious positions: Really, what is the vice president of technology for a National Honor Society chapter?

I dont say any of this to excuse myself or even say something as banal as sometimes stereotypes are real. I would just like to clear the air before we go on much more about Alex Chen, affirmative action and the broken way we talk about race and privilege in this country. The act of reporting on your own people, especially for prestigious outlets, requires a certain arrogance and presumption  that because you look like your subject, your perspective carries some revelatory power that might escape a standard, white journalist. I used to believe this was true, but I am no longer so certain.

Like Alex, I am a first-generation Asian-American with two college-educated parents. Unlike Alex, I grew up in majority-white, upper-middle-class college towns that exposed me to all the pathways to success that lay outside pure academic achievement. I spent my early childhood in a graduate-student housing complex just a few blocks from Harvards campus, where my father was getting his post-doctorate degree in organic chemistry. My mother made ends meet by babysitting for the children of professors. (In my early 20s, I ended up at the Columbia M.F.A. creative-writing program with the sister of one of these children. Her father was a famous physicist who wrote best-selling novels, and although I never brought up the fact that my mother had changed her sisters diapers, Ive thought a lot about how quickly the gap in our backgrounds had been erased.) By the time I graduated from a very good public high school in North Carolina, I could rattle off almost all the other very good high schools across the country, whether St. Marks, Isidore Newman, Montgomery Bell Academy, Thomas Jefferson Academy, Harvard-Westlake, Lexington High School or New Trier. By the time I was in my 30s, in a professional world stocked with Ivy Leaguers, I realized that everyone I knew from the D.C. area went to Sidwell Friends or Georgetown Day or Potomac, and everyone I know from Los Angeles went to Harvard-Westlake. Perhaps such distinctions seem trivial in the face of every other type of privilege, but within the context of one Harvard alumnus or alumna interviewing a prospective one, these references can lay out the common ground. What might seem like grade-grubbing ambition in a foreign context gets humanized within familiar spaces.
During that first meeting, I asked Alex if he had ever considered applying for a scholarship at any of New York Citys elite private schools, like Horace Mann, Collegiate or Dalton.

What are those? he asked. Are those schools in the city?

Which is all to say, if were going to see how Alex Chen, who would receive roughly the same credits and debits from affirmative action as I would, measures up, we should at least give an honest accounting of his past.

So here are some more relevant facts: Alexs father, Qiao, immigrated to the United States in 1994, when he was 21. He grew up in poverty in the countryside of Fujian Province. He describes his hometown as a thoroughly corrupt place where people like him could not get anything done without bribing a local official. When Qiao was 18, his father moved to Flushing, Queens, where he found construction work and began saving up money. Qiao came three years later, after his father secured a green card, and worked in restaurants around Queens and Long Island. He spoke no English, but he enrolled in Queens College, which had an E.S.L. program for international students.

In 2000, Qiao brought his wife, Su, to the United States, and she moved into the basement apartment Qiao shared with his father in Flushing. Qiao saw life in America pragmatically  he acknowledges that he faced discrimination  and it was hard to go anywhere outside Chinese-speaking enclaves. He felt that his classmates at Queens College treated him like a low-rent immigrant. The bad part, he said, was that I didnt know the language, so I didnt feel like I could fight back. But those humiliations paled in comparison to life under corruption in China. Everything was open in America, Qiao said. If I had the right paperwork for something or if I finished the work I was supposed to do, the right thing would get done. At least I could trust that.

Qiao eventually found weekend work selling computer parts until he settled into a stable job as a technician. Su, who gave birth to Alex a few years after arriving in Flushing, struggled with life in the United States. She had been a middle-school teacher in China, but now she bounced between car dealerships, restaurants and, finally, an ice-cream parlor.

Alex was a bright and self-motivated student, someone whom Su never had to worry about. In the eighth grade, he came home and asked his parents if he could take the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT), the multiple-choice examination that determines entry into the citys top public high schools. Su and Qiao were not planning on pressing Alex to take the SHSAT. And he did not enroll in an intensive prep course. We are not tiger parents, Su said. Alex cares so much about his schoolwork, and we just supported him. But really, we did not know too much about any of this, and so he figured it out himself.

Alex got into Bronx Science, widely considered the second-best of New York Citys three original specialized high schools. Qiao and Su, eager to help their son, but like so many immigrants hampered by the barriers of language and an unfamiliarity with the American school system, joined a group on the Chinese social-media service WeChat in which Chinese parents at Bronx Science talked about their childrens homework and their concerns about the school.","25_2_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cwk0vc/where_does_affirmative_action_leave_asianamericans/","unkle","2019-08-28",1566995084,8,8,0,0,"In the summer of 2018, the parents in the WeChat group began talking about proposed changes to the admissions criteria at the citys specialized schools. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Richard Carranza, his schools chancellor, had proposed a new system that would phase out the SHSAT over two years and replace it with a University of Texas-style admissions program that would award seats to top students at all of the citys middle schools. These changes would result in a radical shift in the racial demographics of the specialized high schools. At Stuyvesant, regarded as the most prestigious of the three specialized high schools, black and Hispanic students made up roughly 14 percent of the student population in 1976; Asians accounted for 16 percent. By 2017, black and Hispanic students had dropped to just 4 percent; Asians, by contrast, were now 74 percent of the student body. By spreading out admissions to the entirety of the citys middle schools, many of which are overwhelmingly black and Latino, enrollment of underrepresented minorities was projected to go from its current 10 percent to nearly 50 percent. After presenting the plan, Carranza said, I just dont buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admissions to these schools, a clear reference to Asian-American students and their parents.

Qiao and Sus WeChat group quickly turned into a political organizing platform. Participants began reaching out to other groups, including ones that supported the affirmative-action lawsuit against Harvard. The Chinese-language news broadcasts they watched every night provided blanket coverage of the SHSAT issue. Many of our friends work in restaurants and are very poor, Su said. They dont know anything about how to make their kids successful except SHSAT and then study hard to go to an Ivy League school. They feel like if you take that away, you are taking away their hope, because they dont speak English well and have a hard time understanding how else to succeed in this country. In mid-June, Qiao attended his first protest, which reconnected him with other parents who hadnt found the same route to the middle class.
This past February, a workshop on the subject of race was offered to middle-school parents; it was run by the Center for Racial Justice in Education, a training organization. When Ingrid Flinn, a white mother of an adopted Asian child, questioned a white, male presenter from the center about the dearth of attention given to Asian-Americans in his presentation, he said that Asians benefited from white supremacy because of their proximity to white privilege. (The center denies that its workshop said Asians benefited from white supremacy.) The implication, Flinn felt, was that there was little need to talk about Asians. Yet they make up about 16 percent of students in the New York City public-school system, and by every measure, they suffer the highest poverty rates of any ethnic or racial group in the five boroughs.

I thought back to a morning when I met Alex in Van Cortlandt Park, a stretch of groomed pasture just about a 20-minute walk from Bronx Science. He and his cross-country teammates were meeting for their first practice of the year: South Asians, two girls wearing head coverings and full-length athletic wear as well as a handful of half-Asian kids. As they stretched, they joked about being out of shape and complained about the 1 train service up to the Bronx. According to the racial-privilege hierarchy of the New York City public schools, all those kids, with all their different backgrounds, skin tones and countries of origin, are the same as Alex. None of them warrant a mention in discussions of racial hierarchies.I think its larger than Harvard. The real question is: Do we want to live in a society where character or skin color is the driving force for our discussions about merit? In singling out Asian-Americans for exclusion, Harvard panders to the worst stereotypes about us: that we are math geniuses with no personality.
The Rally for the American Dream kicked off in Bostons Copley Square on the eve of the trial. The organizers had promised thousands of demonstrators who would be rallying in favor of S.F.F.A.s lawsuit. This optimistic projection (only a few hundred showed up) had been made by Yukong Zhao, a 56-year-old Chinese immigrant from Orlando who is the president of the Asian-American Coalition for Education and the author of the 2013 book The Chinese Secrets for Success: Five Inspiring Confucian Values. (The values: Determination for an Outstanding Life, Pursuing an Excellent Education, Saving for a Better Life, Caring for Your Family and Developing Desirable Friendships.) Zhao walks with a bit of a stoop, but he exudes an optimistic, cheerful energy when talking about America and its promise.

Zhao had always been involved in politics, but ever since he immigrated to the United States in 1992 to go to graduate school in urban studies and get an M.B.A., he has mostly expressed his opinions through writing. In one piece he wrote for The Orlando Sentinel, titled Immigrants Can Add Valuable Ingredients to Melting Pot, Zhao posed this question: Why do so many immigrants prosper in America? Because we have suffered many life challenges from where we started to become Americans, we have valuable experiences we can share with struggling families, our spirit to overcome challenges, and our great cultural heritage on education and money management.

Zhao, who became an American citizen in 2009, began his transition from writer to activist in October 2013, when Jimmy Kimmel put together a round table of young children for his late-night show and asked them what the United States should do about its $1.3 trillion debt to China. One suggestion, from a floppy-haired blond kid in a blazer and tie, was kill everyone in China. The joke sparked the expected online outrage among Chinese-American advocacy groups. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of several American cities to call for Kimmels firing. Kimmel quickly apologized, and ABC pulled the segment from its archives and YouTube.

Fresh off what these activists saw as a victory against the Kimmel show, the nascent movement turned its attention to Senate Constitutional Amendment 5 (SCA-5), a proposal in the California State Legislature that would have significantly scaled back Proposition 209, the 1996 ballot initiative that effectively ended affirmative action in California state universities. They followed up with civil rights complaints, including one that involved Zhaos son. An informal partnership with Edward Blum soon followed.

Zhao has a complicated relationship with Blum. He says he appreciates all Blum has done for the cause, but he resists what he sees as the white-savior narrative. Asians, without any help from white people, had been challenging elite colleges since the 1980s. He understood that Blums money and connections might go further with the press and even the courts, but he saw this latest lawsuit and S.F.F.A. as a natural outgrowth of his grass-roots movement. Asian-Americans filed all the complaints and stopped SCA-5, he said. This is not about conservatives or Republicans. We are not their tools. We are fighting for our children.

I met Zhao at his hotel overlooking the Charles River on the morning of the Rally for the American Dream. He hadnt been sleeping well, and his left eye had exploded into a deep, concerning shade of red. He asked if I wanted to hear him practice his speech  there were some passages where the English might need a little help. Zhao paced between the two queen beds and ran through his speech in his thick accent but practiced delivery. It was long and filled with purple phrases about freedom, fairness and the American dream. I could sense the hours he had spent on the speech, fine-tuning every phrase and making sure he gave proper credit to everyone who had put together the rally. On his first run-through, he asked me if it was IN-actment or EN-actment, and then a few moments later, was it unethic or unethical? Toward the end, I told him he had wrongly said risen up rather than rising up.

He asked if he should lose the kicker: God bless America. And God bless Asian-American children. I told him that I thought it would be a bit off to end with a phrase that made it seem as if Asian-American children needed a separate blessing from God. He puzzled over it for a bit, his glasses pushed far down on his nose, and ultimately agreed. As we crossed over a bridge into Boston, Zhao said, Jay, I am frustrated with my pronunciation. If I had better pronunciation, I could make a much bigger impact on American society. I can work on everything else  ideas and writing  but the pronunciation is so hard to improve.","25_2_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cwk0vc/where_does_affirmative_action_leave_asianamericans/","unkle","2019-08-28",1566995098,9,9,0,0,"I did not agree with much of Zhaos speech, but I felt a connection with him, unexpected but undeniable. How many times had my own parents asked for help with emails or letters to school? And how had their limitations and perpetual foreignness affected their ability to stand up for themselves? Zhao kept telling me that he was fighting for me and my young daughter. It was hard to know what to make of this declaration, but I never doubted that he believed it. Whenever he hears talk about relative privilege or white supremacy or all the advantages Asians have over other minorities, he considers his own childhood under the Cultural Revolution, his own path to the United States and his struggles with learning the language, and fails to see why the spoils of that work, which include a big house in a gated community, couldnt be achieved by anyone else.

This need to be seen  to have the struggles of Asian-Americans and the discrimination they faced be recognized  was echoed by Mortara in his closing statement for the S.F.F.A. lawsuit. Someday this will be written about in the history books, and those books will say: There was Asian discrimination at Harvard, Mortara said in court. Choking back tears, he said, Of that Im confident. And while I might have been surprised by the outpouring of emotion and skeptical of his methods, I did not doubt Mortaras sincerity either.

During the time I spent talking to Asian-American students about affirmative action, I noticed that many of them wanted to talk, instead, about their immigrant parents. For them, the issue was relatively simple. The way they see it, they came to this country with nothing and went through a lot of discrimination, a student at an elite, high-profile public high school in New York told me. They dont understand why the system says they have an advantage over anyone else. I disagree with them on a lot of it, but I understand why they feel that way.

For many of these parents, the Harvard case, with its revelations about personal ratings, as well as what many of the parents in New York see as the erasure from the citys Department of Education, has created a binary choice. They can choose the side that is trying to get more of their children into Harvard and other elite schools, or they can choose the side that will not even bother mentioning them. Qiao Chen, despite the protestations of his son, voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Although he now regrets the choice, he told me that he did it because liberals do not care about Asian-Americans.Race-conscious admissions for me meant acknowledging the full human dignity of my story and my achievements in context. I will never forget the diversity of perspectives and experiences that my peers bravely shared on campus and in this trial, all of which are incredible assets in this multiracial world we willgo on to work and live in. Regardless of how this case isdecided, the educational landscape is much bigger thanjust Harvard  I hope that as a society we look toward increasing educational opportunities that are accessible for all.
Sparse country is the term Harvard uses to describe the geographic areas of the United States that are underrepresented in the student body. This includes the usual suspects  Wyoming, Alaska, Montana  but also states with large metropolitan areas like Nevada, Arizona and Oklahoma. To geographically diversify its incoming freshman class, Harvard gives a bump to promising students from sparse country. It also recruits heavily to ensure that the top students in Arizona and Alabama and Maine consider coming to Harvard over their local state colleges and universities. Recruitment certainly does not equal admission, but Harvard starts to shape its incoming class through these early encounters and follows up diligently and often through email, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat.

This process begins with sophomores and juniors who take the PSAT, and later the SAT. Harvard purchases scores from the College Board and mails invitations to apply to students with strong scores relative to their demographic group, whatever that might be. In sparse country, the admissions office extends an invitation to any white student who scores above 1,310 on the tests and any black student who scores above a 1,100. Male Asian students from the same places need to score a 1,380 on the tests to receive an invitation to apply. For female Asian students, the cutoff is 1,350.

For the past four decades, these types of decisions have been the purview of William R. Fitzsimmons, a graduate of the class of 1967 and Harvard Colleges dean of admissions. Fitzsimmons, who goes by Fitz, grew up in his familys gas station in Weymouth, a working-class suburb on Bostons South Shore. In the parlance of his office, he was a first-generation college student from an economically disadvantaged background, as well as a star hockey goalie. Although he wasnt an economically disadvantaged minority, he understands what its like to be different at the most elite educational institution in America.

Fitz, with his strong, square jaw, carefully measured Boston accent and tweed jackets, perfectly fills the role of the Harvard man. Over four days of testimony, he laid out his legacy  he came to the Harvard admissions office in 1972, took over a few years later and has been the dean since 1986. This presented something of a problem for the defense because every bit of mail, every spreadsheet, every memo or communiqué issued by the Harvard College admissions office since the Nixon administration reflected on Fitzsimmonss office.

During a bizarre section of Fitzsimmonss testimony in which he claimed a 1,100 on the PSAT was only slightly lower than a 1,380, an S.F.F.A. lawyer named John M. Hughes posed the following hypothetical: Lets take two students at the same high school in Las Vegas. One white, the other Asian. The white student scores a 1,310. The Asian student receives a 1,370. According to Fitzsimmonss testimony, the white student would be invited to apply to Harvard while the Asian student would not. How, the attorney asked, could Fitzsimmons begin to explain this?

In response, Fitzsimmons talked about his own days at Harvard and a roommate from Mitchell, S.D., home of the celebrated Corn Palace, and how he had been a great ambassador for his home state. There are people who, lets say, for example, have only lived in the sparse-country state for a year or two, Fitzsimmons noted.

The implication, of course, was that an Asian applicant from Oklahoma or Nebraska or South Dakota or Alaska does not count when it comes to geographic diversity. In Harvards eyes, this Asian, even if his family settled in Nevada after helping build the transcontinental railroad, could never be an ambassador for his plot of sparse country. He was, instead, an Asian-American like other Asian-Americans. The white students family, by contrast, could have recently moved to Las Vegas to work in the emerging tech field, and he would still be assumed to be a fitting representative of the Silver State.

When Harvard went looking for a South Dakotan, did it just look for a white kid who grew up on a ranch and worked the concession stands at the Corn Palace? When it wanted an Oklahoman, was it really seeking out a cowboy who also liked high-school debate and biology? Harvards vision of diversity seemed stuck in a time before immigration and demographic change. During his cross-examination, Fitzsimmons was asked several times if the Harvard admissions process had changed at all in the 46 years he had worked in the admissions office. Fitzsimmons, every time, said the system had remained almost exactly the same.The current practice of affirmative action is discriminatory and unfair to everyone. Education is a right, and the race of someone should not determine whether or not someone should get into school.
On the third day of the trial, I had dinner with Sally Chen and her friend Thang Diep, both in Harvards graduating class of 2019, at a Japanese-barbecue restaurant in Harvard Square. Thang, a senior neurobiology major and one of the main voices testifying in support of Harvard at the trial, had been repeatedly misidentified in media reports about the trial as a refugee. This, he said, was really annoying, and he requested I not make the same mistake. Thangs grandparents were the actual refugees  they were the ones who fled Vietnam and settled in Reseda, a middle-class suburb in Los Angeless San Fernando Valley. When Thang was 8, he and his parents immigrated to join them in California. Thang spoke almost no English, but through a self-imposed regimen of assimilation, he worked his way into one of Southern Californias most prestigious magnet high schools.

People on Harvards side testified about Thangs essay, emphasizing his divulgence that he placed a pencil between his teeth while practicing his pronunciation because he heard that was the quickest way to overcome the steep learning curve that separates a tonal language like Vietnamese from English. In comments, one of Harvards admissions readers wrote, Essay- immigrant Vietnamese identity &amp; pencils as tools. And then, Addl- grappling with sexual identity.

Thang was valedictorian of his high-school class, but he scored only a combined 1,360 on the verbal and math sections of the SAT, and his other standardized test scores werent much better. These results most likely would have put him outside the lower threshold for Harvard, which, as it said throughout the trial, turns away dozens of applicants with perfect scores every year.","25_2_1_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cwk0vc/where_does_affirmative_action_leave_asianamericans/","unkle","2019-08-28",1566995114,9,9,0,0,"Sally and Thang were the de facto counterexamples in the trial. Their smiling photos were shown on the courtroom television screens; their G.P.A.s and test scores were discussed, at length, by Fitzsimmons and the stream of pro-diversity speakers backing Harvard. Sally, who grew up in a low-income immigrant household in San Francisco, proved that highly motivated, poor Asian students would be admitted to Harvard. Thang, whose low SAT scores were put on parade throughout the trial, proved that Harvard actually did care about Asian struggle narratives. But Thangs and Sallys stories, which were pushed out to the media, existed almost as ornamentation to the actual trial. In fact, it wasnt clear if Harvard or its experts knew much about Asians at all. On the second-to-last day of the trial, Mortara went through a litany of stereotypes about Asian applicants  one-dimensional, future doctors, children of mathematicians and engineers. He asked David Card, an economist testifying for Harvard as an expert witness, if he was aware that they were, indeed, stereotypes. Each time, Card said he wasnt sure.

Both Sally and Thang seemed aware of their role in the trial. But they also dont see the trial as a fight between concerned Asian parents and Harvards admissions office, but rather as the last defense of affirmative action against a man who had successfully undercut the Voting Rights Act and who seems hellbent on ending racial preferences everywhere. I dont really feel like Im on the side of Harvard, Sally said. As someone who advocates against Harvard on many issues, its really hard to give Harvard this kind of power. So I think of it more as having a broad impact on the baseline for not just here but a lot of other places, like workplaces and other universities.

Sallys dilemma was shared by many of the alumni, students and faculty who showed up to the courthouse. Its difficult to defend a vision of diversity that has had many of its clearest and most evocative claims of racial and economic justice stripped away by decades of court challenges, demographic change in the applicant pool and escalating hypercompetitiveness for a fixed number of seats. During the trial, the racial and social-justice reasoning  the spirit of affirmative action  was never really stated. What stood in its place, mostly because of the legal realities of diversity, which constrained what Harvard could defend in court, was the sense that students of color on campus needed to have others who looked like them. This justification exposed one of the puzzling contradictions at the heart of this case: By law, Harvard cannot have a quota system. But it also looks as if Harvard believes there is a set range of how many black, Latino and Asian students ought to be on campus. Roughly 30 percent of the seats in every Harvard class go to athletes, legacies, the children of faculty and applicants on the deans interest list, composed in large part of the children of donors. This group, called A.L.D.C.s, get into Harvard at a rate of about 45 percent, far greater than the 5 percent rate for the rest of the pool. Two percent of Asian applicants are A.L.D.C.s. The zero-sum view of this arrangement never asks why the spots for more Asian kids couldnt come from the pool of A.L.D.C.s.

S.F.F.A.s attorneys did not contest the defense of the benefits of diversity, as displayed in court. There was no need, really. They chose, instead, to pick out a few contradictions in Harvards practices that implicitly questioned whether the schools actual practices measured up to its expressed, righteous defense.Despite my strong support for diversity policies and race-conscious admissions, I in no way want to make it seem that Harvards admissions system or treatment of Asian-Americans is perfect. Harvard can and should do more to make sure that they fight against any implicit biases that may permeate the admissions system. But the solution to this issue is to not ignore the racial and financial barriers of access that continue to plague our country, or to reduce the nuance within an already limited application  its to pay more attention to race.
In the months after the trials conclusion, I asked Harvard on numerous occasions to explain its admissions process. (I made several requests to interview Fitzsimmons as well. All of these were denied.) The stock answer, always delivered from the P.R. office, never deviated from what Harvard has consistently said: We have a complicated and in-depth process that involves dozens of people and hundreds of hours, and theres no way to quantify it. You just have to trust it.

Some clarity, however dim, can be found in Plaintiffs Exhibit 555 from the trial: Ethnicity was only considered a plus when the applicant wrote about or indicated the significance of his or her heritage, or when there was some other indicia in the file of the applicants involvement with ethnic community organizations or groups.

This passage comes from the 1990 report on Harvards admissions practices filed by the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education. In the 28 years since then, the personal essay has become an even larger part of how Harvard makes its race-conscious decisions, so much so that in a draft of instructions sent out last year, the admissions office specified that the consideration of race or ethnicity should be in connection with the applications discussion of the effect an applicants race or ethnicity has had on the applicant, not simply the fact alone.

When Sally was applying to colleges, she says, her guidance counselor advised her to not write her essay about her identity, because nobody wants to read another Asian immigrant story. Sally ignored him and wrote about acting as a translator for her parents as they encountered the humiliations and hassles of working-class life.

Sally scored a 1,550 on the SAT. She was student-body president at Lowell and played violin in the school orchestra. But during the trial, Harvards attorneys intimated that she would not have gotten into Harvard without her personal qualities, calling her admission a wonderful example of the consideration of an application by a group of people who ultimately came to the correct decision and admitted Ms. Chen. But it was only the result of an iterative and open process. As proof, they pointed to her application, which included an interviewers report mentioning her ethnicity on two occasions:

Categorized as low-income and with Taiwanese-speaking parents, she relates to the plight of the outsiders in Ralph Ellison and William Faulkner. ...

And:

Her claims about making friends across multiple social groups seem credible. As the youngest of 4 in a culturally Chinese home, she feels a responsibility to take care of her parents. Recommending a 1 specifically for Contribution because of her demonstrated energy and specific desire to connect socially with everybody. As the youngest of 4 in a small apartment, she has lots of experience with being a roommate in close quarters.

Its worth asking if a white student, who did not bear the stereotype of the shy Asian who only hangs out with other Asians, would need to credibly claim to want to make friends across multiple social groups. And while its difficult to read too much into such brief notes, Sallys top personality score seemed to come from the fact that she broke the stereotype and wouldnt just be quiet and self-segregated. If this is Harvards idea of diversity, its a white-down vision that rewards students for acting, in essence, more like wealthy white kids.

But the emphasis on the essay revealed a much more troubling standard. Harvard, in essence, is saying that if you want your race to count, you need to prove to us why it matters. Or perhaps, to be more precise, when you write an essay to present who you are to the most prestigious college in the country, you should reduce your life to a moment of trauma.

At dinner at the Japanese steakhouse, Thang seemed to understand all this. While quietly searing his steak on the tabletop grill, he said: I dont want to defend Harvard. But its the better of two evils.
Affirmative action is designed so that for every one person who benefits, someone else needs to lose. Unfortunately, those losing should not be another minority. I think that it is important for us to understand that maintaining diversity is a priority because it is necessary to have multiple cultures and backgrounds blend together for people to have a well-rounded education.
In September 2017, Delmar Fears, a 19-year-old junior at Cornell, walked up to the office of President Martha E. Pollack. As co-chair of the group Black Students United, she was accompanied by hundreds of chanting students who had all come to deliver a set of demands. The list mostly included administrative and curricular changes, from the creation of a minority-liaison-at-large position to the hiring of psychologists and physicians of color. But the ninth demand, sandwiched between the creation of a student honor board and a permanent presidential task force, set off an unexpected maelstrom.

We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students. While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism.","25_2_1_1_1_1_1"

But that year Fears wrote a final paper on the issue titled Who Makes Up the 7 Percent of Black Cornellians? which detailed some of the demographic change that had taken place on exclusive college campuses. In a 2004 New York Times article, Henry Louis Gates Jr., the chairman of Harvards African and African-American studies department, and Lani Guinier, a professor in the law school, pointed out that while Harvard had increased its black undergraduate population to 8 percent, a majority of those students  up to two-thirds  were international students, first- or second-generation immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean or the children of biracial couples. What was rare, Gates said, was the black student whose four grandparents lived through slavery, Reconstruction and Jim Crow. Mary C. Waters, the head of Harvards sociology department, told The Times, You need a philosophical discussion about what are the aims of affirmative action. If its about getting black faces at Harvard, then youre doing fine. If its about making up for 200 to 500 years of slavery in this country and its aftermath, then youre not doing well.
In 2007, Camille Z. Charles, a professor of sociology and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and three co-authors, Margarita Mooney, Douglas S. Massey and Kimberly C. Torres, published a study in The Journal of Education titled Black Immigrants and Black Natives Attending Selective Colleges and Universities in the United States. Charles, Mooney, Massey and Mary J. Fischer followed up that research with a 2009 article, Affirmative Action Programs for Minority Students: Right in Theory, Wrong in Practice. Both papers reported an overrepresentation of black immigrant students at highly selective colleges and universities compared with black Americans whose ancestors were enslaved.

Charless study drew on data from 28 schools, going back to 1999. Nearly 20 years later, she is confident that the proportion of black immigrants has increased, but she cant say exactly how much, because schools do not make that information accessible to the public. Its a way to have some plausible deniability, Charles told me. The schools are purposefully not paying attention to the backgrounds of the black students they admit. In the 80s and 90s, low-income black students could talk about overcoming obstacles in their essays, but over time, that narrative has worn thin. But the immigrant narrative, which is also an American narrative, in some ways might have become a more appealing story for admissions officers. A student can write, say, My parents were doctors in Nigeria, but they had to start all over in the United States, and that story doesnt invoke white guilt. It doesnt even tie to affirmative action in the same way, because there isnt this assumption of lesser qualifications that still follows black American students, no matter their backgrounds or their parents backgrounds. Charles continued: I think there are American blacks whose families have suffered generationally who are being squeezed out.

Charles, it should be said, did not undertake her study in order to pit one group of black people against another. And she emphasizes that she does not think affirmative-action spots should be taken away from black immigrants.

Edward Blum, Delmar Fears and Yukong Zhao may not agree on much of anything, but they all have made versions of an argument that the spirit of affirmative action has been replaced by a largely cosmetic, overly simplified diversity that allows elite institutions to report gains in black and Latino student populations without having to engage in the harder work of undoing systemic inequality. Waterss question from 2004 has largely gone unaddressed: If you stop random supporters of affirmative action on the street and ask why they believe in it, they will most likely discuss the need to address the harms of historic, institutional racism. They may talk abstractly about a poor, inner city or urban kid in, say, Detroit and how his test scores, grades and accomplishments should be evaluated in the context of the extraordinary inequality within this country.

The truth at Harvard and other elite private colleges is that the supposed zero-sum game of admissions slots isnt really between Asian immigrants and the descendants of enslaved people, but rather between Asian immigrants, Latino immigrants and black immigrants. Some inevitable, deeply uncomfortable questions arise: If you compare an Asian-American student raised in poverty by parents who fled Vietnam during the fall of Saigon with the son of Chilean doctors who come from generational wealth and sent their child to 12 years of private school, who is more privileged? If you accept that the child of, say, solidly middle-class Ghanaian immigrants has to deal with racism in the work force, profiling by the police and all the harms of systemic inequality while the same working-class Asian kid gets to slide into whiteness, how much advantage do you give to ameliorate the disadvantage between one immigrant and another? What if you replace the working-class Vietnamese student with the daughter of Bangladeshi immigrants, who, among other things, has had to deal with the profiling of Muslim communities and Trumps travel ban? These are not outlier examples used in bad faith to present a provocative but false choice. At Harvard and other elite schools, the outlier example is the inner city kid from Detroit.

These bizarre, discomforting litigations of race and privilege make sense only within the context of the most exclusive places in America. But if Harvard loses in the Supreme Court, Blum will be closer to his goal of eliminating racial preferences, not only in college admissions but also in every other corner of federal law. Even if Blum eventually loses this case, its hard to imagine that he will stop. In 2014, S.F.F.A. filed another discrimination lawsuit, against the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The U.N.C. case, which has yet to go to trial, is not about Asian-American applicants, but the goal is the same: end affirmative action everywhere.

On March 12 of this year, a group of federal prosecutors in the same Boston building as Judge Burroughss courtroom unsealed the indictments in Operation Varsity Blues, the nationwide college-admissions bribery case that set off a monthslong media circus involving everyone from the actress Felicity Huffman to the head coach of Yales womens soccer team. Legally speaking, Varsity Blues has nothing to do with S.F.F.A. v. Harvard, but the scandal recast the affirmative-action debate in a bit of a humiliating yet ultimately necessary context: It felt as if a bunch of minorities were clawing at one another while a line of entitled, less qualified white kids walked through the gates of Ivy League schools as their alumni parents unpacked an S.U.V. filled with weird rackets and skis.
A few weeks later, I met Alex again at a bubble-tea shop in Flushing. Congratulations were in order  after a somewhat rocky admissions process in which he had applied early to Yale and been deferred, was accepted to Binghamton, Rochester and Rice but rejected at Brown, Princeton and Stanford and was wait-listed at Vanderbilt, Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Duke, Alex had received some good news. He had been accepted at Yale, his dream school.

Hows it feel? I asked.

I mean, Im excited, he said.

Did you expect to get in?

Of course not! I mean, its Yale. ...

Were you upset that you didnt get into some of those other schools? I asked.

No, why would I be upset?

Like Brown. ... Dont you think you were qualified to go to Brown?

Well, I dont think I really fit the type of super intellectually curious student that Brown says theyre looking for, he said. I mean, its not that Im not intellectually curious  I am  but they seem to want people who dont really know what they want to do yet and think the entire world is fascinating. Im a bit more focused than that.

He said his opinion of affirmative action had evolved. My thinking has really changed, he said, noting that his government class had discussed affirmative action and how it connected to white supremacy. He still thought it was wrong to have a system where some peoples work was less valued than others, but he said he appreciated why it might be necessary to adjust for differences in background.

My understanding of him had changed, too. Despite all his résumé building and the involvement in random clubs and his own admitting that some of that effort had been so much padding, I could see that his was an inquisitive mind, and he wanted more than simply to disprove the trope of the cynical Asian grade-grubber. His core interests lay in the sociological data projects he had done at N.Y.U. and then at the offices of Assemblywoman Niou. I asked if he had written about his data work for his essay. He said he had mentioned it, but that he had mostly written about being the child of immigrants.

Didnt you know you werent supposed to write about that? I asked, thinking of Sally Chens guidance counselor.

What? he asked.

I think theyre tired of hearing the immigrant story, especially from East Asian kids of college-educated parents, I said.

What! he said again, with what sounded like genuine disbelief. He stirred his bubble tea with a straw and laughed a bit sheepishly. I wish someone had told me.","25_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

I've always struggled a bit when thinking about the higher education issues today. On the one hand, I absolutely agree that diversity is important in education. It's imperative that young adults have the opportunity to be exposed to perspectives different from their own. I also don't believe that numerical scores should be the sole criteria for admissions. Asian Americans possess this diverse array of talents too, and we should be eager to showcase this. Not to mention, the image of robotic test takers is already quite prevalent and *extremely* damaging, so to argue against holistic admissions only reinforces this stereotype in the eyes of our peers, admissions officers, and eventually HR managers.

But on the other hand, I can't help but to feel that these ""holistic"" processes are ever so subtly biased. ""Holistic"" will always be presented as warm and desirable, but behind closed doors it also gives schools much more room to skew the results. Why did Asian applicants score lower on personality? Harvard's personality score supposedly comes from the student's essays, recommendations, and alumni interviews. I sincerely doubt that Asian students would be performing worse here. Plus, do we really accept that we are, as Harvard puts it, lacking in courage, kindness, and likability? Isn't this precisely the kind of racial prejudice that we today should be aiming to eliminate? The holistic process is supposed to be a path for students to demonstrate their potential, instead it seems to be a mechanism to conceal racial undertones, even if subconsciously. And I suspect I'm not the only one who feels this way.

The way to proceed, I believe, is to scrutinize the use of admissions criteria such as personality. It shouldn't be up to the admissions officers anyway to decide who's more likable or courageous, as these are completely subjective and impossible to determine from a college application. We should not seek to eliminate affirmative action, as diversity does serve an important purpose. And even if we're not a part of the African American or Latino communities, we still owe it to each other to be genuinely considerate. Not to mention, fighting against race-based admissions will always be a losing battle, since even if people agree there won't be much sympathy given how Asian Americans are already overrepresented in top schools. And of course, we absolutely cannot allow ourselves to be used as pawns in this arena anymore. Pretty much every notable lawsuit in the past decade against higher education, including this current one, has been led by conservative white activists, dragging us into their fight at their convenience. This cannot continue.

We are not known for being confrontational, but of all the political issues this one might be the one that ignites us the most. No matter where you stand, I urge you to stand up and make your voice heard.","1"

Nope, they are not, but frankly, no one is. That is, there are very very few non-Asians (individuals here and there) who genuinely give two shits about any Asian-American issues at all.

There was already a precedent set there.  That is one of the reasons why the claim that it is now used to suppress AA admissions is quite believable.  Holistic admissions can theoretically be used in a genuine race-blind way (if your goal really is race-blind admissions), but it can absolutely (and obviously) be ""weaponized"" to just make admissions as subjective and biased as possible to create whatever student body you want to.  

The issue is simply whether or not you can gather and collect evidence that the process was racially biased.  While holistic admissions makes the acceptance policy more subjective, it obviously also leaves a vague ""subjective"" paper trail as well, making gathering evidence not that simple.  

Strictly speaking, yes, it's true that the concept of affirmative action and the concept of racial bias against AAs need not overlap.  So the author wants to say ""Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater"" and would rather cure what's wrong with the bathwater (fix racial bias against AAs, don't get rid of affirmative action).  

&gt;Even if Harvard admissions officers were biased against Asian Americans, the solution would not lie in abandoning holistic admissions and affirmative action,

But we actually have to step back first and realize that affirmative action and holistic admissions should not be conflated!  And the fact that the author does conflate them to me is a problem.  It feels like the author is just one of many out there who has a casual understanding of the problem and isn't really qualified to make a proper journalistic or expert opinion on this (not that I can, either, but I'm just a random Redditor).  Holistic admissions is the concept of evaluating an individual on all their stuff - extracurriculars, socioeconomic background, etc., etc.  Affirmative action is the concept of explicitly giving an advantage to minorities in admissions.  You can theoretically have holistic admissions that is race-blind (~~what the author hopes for~~ - thank you to /u/InSearchOfGoodPun for correcting me.  The author wants affirmative action.) and so has no affirmative action, and you can also theoretically have affirmative action without using holistic admissions (e.g. an admissions system that uses only exams but there are quotas for admissions/cutoff scores for geographical areas or ethnicities.  I believe China does this with the gaokao with different cutoff scores for provinces and ethnic minorities).  

IMHO, the ""philosophical"" arguments for dismantling affirmative action are: 

1. The same as the argument for test papers to be graded to not have the test taker's name written on them - only an ID number.  The names and IDs can be matched by another teacher/official.  This way, you minimize the possibility that the grader of a test paper will be biased against the test taker.  In other words, if resumes with black American-sounding names get disproportionately low callbacks from hiring employers, a radical solution is for resumes to not have names on them, only ID numbers.  The names can be matched with names later in the process (even if racial bias may be an issue later in the process, at least in the callback stage it will be minimized).  By the way, this is similar to why AAs disproportionately go into STEM, as the author duly notes - it's to shield oneself from subjective discrimination/exclusion.

2. The real enemy of AAs is ""weaponized"" holistic admissions (and not affirmative action per se), but the problem is that holistic admissions and affirmative action go hand-in-hand for whatever reason in the US and there are, understandably, defenders of affirmative action.  (One reason that holistic admissions and affirmative action go hand-in-hand is an aversion to official quotas.  If in a parallel world we all just accepted that colleges officially quota their student racial compositions using affirmative action standards, we could just go with that and drop holistic admissions.  Ethnic minorities might not mind that much because a) as long as your own minority gets some sort of overrepresentation thanks to the policy, you might be happy, b) if you don't feel like your minority is getting the proper representation, at least there's some objective data you can point to and fight against, and c) ethnic minorities are used to feeling quota'd, anyway.  The difference between an official and an unofficial quota is minor to an ethnic minority applying for admissions.  It's only major for the admissions officers and policy makers because an official quota may invite accusations of inequality and stuff.  (It might also be technically illegal to quota admissions?))  It's unlikely that U.S. colleges will drop holistic admissions while keeping affirmative action by using quotas or different cutoff evaluations for different races/ethnicities.  Even setting aside affirmative action, it's unlikely that U.S. colleges will drop holistic admissions at all, since holistic admissions gives colleges control over the makeup of their student bodies - even a truly ideal race-blind college may still want control over the makeup of their student body (e.g. a diversity or focus of extracurricular interests and academic majors).  So in this view, if holistic admissions cannot be done away with on its own or its racial bias against AAs cannot be fixed, the other solution is to do away with affirmative action.  In the AA view, even if that hurts non-AA minority admissions (and helps white American admissions), at least it will do away with this specific unofficial racial disadvantage that AA applicants have.  

Going to another topic: 

&gt; The model minority stereotype portrays Asian Americans as having made it: They worked hard and persevered and achieved the American dream.

&gt;Data reveals a much more complicated picture, but the framing of Asian Americans as successful was never about accuracy: It was about driving a wedge between members of different ethnic groups and undermining the claims of systemic racism made by civil rights activists. (If they can make it, why cant you?)

Is this really true from the AA perspective?  I understand that it's true for non-AA minorities, but from the AA perspective, or rather the East Asian American perspective, I think model minority = a manifestation of putting your head down and working hard and avoiding putting your fate in the hands of people you can't trust to be racially unbiased (i.e. going into STEM, avoiding politics and conflict).  I'm not saying that there aren't people who use the model minority thing to attack non-AA minorities, because there certainly are, but I would say that EAAs don't see the model minority thing as first and foremost about that.  To me, the EAA perspective is, ""We don't care what you call us, model or unmodel minority or whatever.  Our priority is to survive and advance in the optimal way we can see.""  What I'm trying to say I guess is that there are two aspects to the model minority thing.  One is when it's used to attack non-AAs.  The other is a manifestation of this:

&gt;While interviewing Asian-American students in colleges across the country, we have heard students report that their parents push them into STEM because they assume that people in STEM fields will be judged more objectively than in other fields and careers; racial bias will be less of a factor. Colleges and universities need to understand that Asian Americans do encounter racism and that their seemingly stereotypical behavior may be a response to this. 

which might exist even in a world where non-AAs aren't attacked by the model minority argument.","2"

But in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. For example, if we have an Asian student who is a strong academic performer with great extracurricular activities, sports, etc. and another student of a different race who is not as strong in these areas. But I'm Harvard, and I've already accepted the roughly 20% of the Asians I need for the incoming class. I'm not going to openly say that I accepted the second student because he or she was of x/y/z race. That would be terrible, optically. No, I'm going to say that the second candidate had other qualitative attributes that put them over the top.

The idea that it's the 21st century and we are talking about popularity as a factor of admission is insane. Admission into a school should not be a popularity contest. As an admissions officer, you should be focused on whether or not someone will be a productive member of society (both socially and economically) after leaving your institution AND NOT whether or not you want to fuck the applicant.

With everything said, Harvard should actually use the personal rating as intended rather than as a proxy for race. And if you want to argue that they are not doing that, I think you're going to have a difficult time seeing as the racial make up of the student body has been rather consistent over the past couple of decades. But hey, it could be the coincidence of the century!

The law already says (and has said for a long time) that it's not constitutional to have a racial preference for whites over Asians.

Being able to prove it is a whole separate issue and gets messy. [This very issue was covered in depth in the Harvard lawsuit](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/10/3/admissions-decision-explained/), but it was SFFA (who want to make affirmative action illegal) that claimed Harvard has a racial preference for whites over Asians, while Harvard (and defenders of affirmative action) claimed that there was such no racial preference. For those who support affirmative action but believe that Harvard is discriminating against asians, it's a tough spot to be in.

It's also important to note how narrow this protection actually is. It's unconstitutional to have preferences based on race but constitutional to have preferences highly correlated with being rich and white, such as legacy status, donor status or athlete status ([this is a great article]( https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/harvard-university-and-scandal-sports-recruitment/599248/#%3A~%3Atext%3DNearly%2090%20percent%20of%20recruited%2Cpercent%20of%20its%20admitted%20class.) on how Ivy athletics are another way for wealthy families to get their kids into these schools). 

In other words, Harvard cannot prefer a middle-class white applicant over an equally qualified Asian applicant, but can absolutely prefer a legacy, donor or athlete applicant (who are much more likely to be rich and white) over an equally or even more qualified Asian applicant. And since there's been no legal basis to challenge this, the fact that Harvard doesn't technically have a preference for whites over Asians (even if true) doesn't really mean much.","1"

I don't gotta respond to shit. Why am I not surprised. The dude that thinks that people applying for college is ""skipping the line"" and taking a spot ""reserved"" for my kind turns out to be an entitled douchenozzle. 

I've pointed out the fallacies in your argument. Whether you choose to do the right thing is up to you. 

It is not my burden to educate you on the history of affirmative action and it's effects and benefits for helping minorities and their societal upwards mobility. Go read the countless articles by Asian advocacy groups and why they support affirmative action. 

Man, I can only do so much to make sure that you don't become a pawn for the Conservative party. If you choose to side with the group that has a long history of racism and oppression, THATS ON YOU. I don't know how to explain that they have countlessly screwed over minorities, but you still think you are a ""special"" type of minority.

There are so many misunderstandings about affirmative action. First of all, unlike many people would like to believe, it's not about having race quotas, or you being admitted solely on the fact that you are a certain race. 

Affirmative action is about placing importance on diversity.

Aptitude? What qualifies as aptitude? There's a reason why the lawyer in this case is laser-focused on GPA and standardized test scores. Because they know Asian people will gobble this shit up because this is their strongest factor into getting into colleges. Aptitude can be, extra circulars, field experience, artistic merit, athletic merit, leadership experience. So the repeal of AA would mean the erasure of these deciding factors, because ""scores"", which Asians love because it works in their favor. 

If this repeal is passed, it's defining aptitude as test scores and GPA, which is harmful in general in academia and education. There are really intelligent people, of all races, who are terrible at test taking. Solely looking at this would be harmful to this demographic. 

This is rigging the game so that you'll always win and the rules always favor you. Does this sound fair? Sounds a lot like cheating doesn't it?

So isn't that more about equity i.e. equality of outcomes? I don't get why we should strive for equality of outcome is all, today everyone has the same rights and if you're punishing some (requiring them to have a larger number of achievements or accolades to be accepted to a specific university) to raise up others then it's still discrimination to those punished because you've based it on their parents ethnicities.

I'm obviously in favor of looking at more than grades alone, I'm talking specifically about the ethnicity based weighting of your ""aptitudes.""


Basically, if we all have equal rights now in America then why are we trying to force things to be ""fair"" for everyone? And who gets to decide the balance of such a system? 

How am I promoting 'a rigged game that always favors me'? 

If anything a system based on ethnicity or gender or anything else identity based to decide college acceptance or hiring practices is making the system unfair, at least that's how it seems to me.   ","3_4_2_1"

Because the range of outcomes for under-represented minorities is so, so much worse than the ones that east asians generally face. Black, hispanic, and Native Americans are disproportionately subject to crippling poverty or death by crime. If some AAPI people go to a slightly less prestigious school so that our brothers and sisters of color can gtfo of poverty, then we should absolutely take that trade any day.

&gt;if we all have equal rights now in America

This is your privilege talking. It is absolutely not the case that we all have ""equal rights"" now in America. You are not as likely to be stopped (with the subsequent risk of getting shot by a trigger-happy officer) by a police officer as someone with darker colored skin. You are not as likely to be born in a de-facto segregated and poor neighborhood that diminishes your chance at a decent life. For gender, assuming that you're male, you are still on average going to earn more money for doing the same job as someone who is a woman. The line I quoted from you is an assumption underlying your overall position, and it is a false one. Let me repeat - that assumption is your privilege talking. By ignoring the systemic inequalities that face other minorities (and education is one of many attempts to ameliorate these inequalities), you'd prefer to reshape this tool to your benefit at the cost of other minorities. You're grabbing the limited bottles of Tylenol when others are much sicker than you are. That is how you are ""promiting 'a rigged game that always favors [you].'""

All my comments above, of course, assumes that there is in fact a tradeoff between AAPI and other minorities in the affirmative action debate. Of course, this is a false narrative that white people repeat to pit minority against minority. There is absolutely no reason why t the college slot is a battle between under-represented minority and asian minority. There are also the whites that you're assuming ""earn"" or ""deserve"" the slots they receive. There is zero reason why the remedy for discrimination against AAPI in college admissions is to throw other minorities under the bus. Why not challenge legacy admissions, which clearly favors white applicants? ","3_4_2_1_1"

Take for example the ""Top 10% Rule"" in Texas colleges. When I was a student at UT Austin, the automatic admission rule applied (Of course UT is now ""Top 8%"" from what I understand). Sure, it helped diversity as it lead to an increase in Asian and Hispanic students. But then again, they were the Asian and Hispanic students who had the financial means to prepare for and go to college anyways.

The entire American college application process was designed to weed out a different high-achieving but ""undesirable"" minority (Jewish students) and it's still being used the same way. 

Holistic admissions are rooted in Western ideals of education (quasi-religious dedication, learning for learning's sake, the liberal arts) that run counter to the Asian student who lives in white people's heads (incapable of true passion, animalistic priorities, only good at ""hard"" fields like math or engineering). 

Most of the admissions strategies you'll see on Chinese-language forums are things like ""do an art portfolio to prove you're creative"" or ""put your kid in a writing camp"". Writing about your family or heritage is totally out of the question because the last thing you need to do is remind the admissions officers that you're a goddamn chink. 

I was pretty much raised for the sake of college admissions and I was smack dab in a hyper-competitive school filled with other kids like me. It was a traumatizing, mind-numbing experience. I'm still slowly unlearning all of the self-hatred and paranoia that was ground into me so I could stand a chance against some lazy white bitch who got to have an actual adolescence with family and trips to the mall and romance and whatever people are supposed to do. My parents made it very clear that I was not allowed to relax, ever, because I was Asian and I couldn't afford it. My Asian heritage became nothing more than a speedbump on the road to Harvard. 


**Affirmative action sets arbitrary numerical hoops that you have to jump through. Holistic admissions teach Asian children that being Asian is a shameful disease.** 

Getting rid of AA will do absolutely fuck all to a system that hates us to its core. And if we're gonna go down the ""work with people who hate you uwu"" path, Asian Americans as a community cannot afford to alienate other PoC or reinforce the idea that we're white (no matter how flimsy the reasoning). People are heads-over-heels in love with the narrative of a sniveling, mindless Asian who would do anything for a quick buck. We can't get away with stuff that reinforces that because we just don't have the fucking numbers to create social change on our own, especially when language barriers and the constant erasure of Asian Americans' very existence are still big problems.

**TL;DR affirmative action's repeal would mean very little in an admissions system that's fundamentally antisemitic/anti-Asian and I don't feel like becoming the rhetorical version of the Asian Nazi at Charlottesville**

That also doesn't take into account that such a move undermines the political coalition building that is necessary to build a consensus across the very broad and diverse groups that are agglomerated under the umbrella ""Asian-American"" term.

This is coming from someone who lived in Southern California with one of the largest Asian communities. Back then, I thought this would be a really powerful message, an underdog role who has achieved academic success, who doesn't root for the underdog? After the deadline passed, me and my closest friends decided to pass our essays to each other (we had a no idea stealing policy before deadline), and guess what? Almost all of us had the similar story, with different variations. I considered myself an EXTREMELY good writer in high school, but now that I'm more experienced, looking back, it read like 1st world kid complaining about 1st world problems, comical if not eye-rolling. (Bonus tip, don't write about negative things that hold you back, as cheesy as it sounds, write about positive experiences that make you want to explore/tackle the world. Don't try to frame ""language and cultural barriers"" as limitations to overcome either, it'll end up sound pitiful.) 

The essay question asking you to share an experience, family history, or life event that shaped your world view is a very common one. I call it the 1st generation trap. Many of us think it's a milestone to be 1st generation to do something and will write stories about ""1st gen immigrants with language barrier"", ""1st gen US born with immigrant parents who had language barriers"", ""1st gen college student who had parents who didnt go to college"", ""1st gen US college but parents went to college overseas"" that will all end up sounding very similar. If your younger siblings are applying to Ivy league private schools, make sure they always avoid these topics. 

Edit: I was still able to get accepted by a lot of UCs, but I was top 5-10%ile in class ranking, and lived in california (paid tax for UC schools). This advice is for those applying for Ivy leagues, who are more selective, where every applicant already has over the top grades, high test scores, and a bunch of volunteer/leadership stuff. You gotta differentiate yourself from all the other Asians. ","2"

A lot of it comes down to execution [e.g., this girl's essay on the language barrier](https://thetab.com/us/2017/03/31/got-into-all-ivies-64085) and being reflective in an effective way.

As for differentiation, it's pretty notable every ivy league school's orchestra violin section is 2/3 or more asian, while asian representation is ivy league athletics is ~5% and limited to a few sports. There is significant, artificial selection in the AA applicant pool that ends up making it harder.","2_1"

In my younger years, my writing style was raw and unpolished. It sounded powerful to myself, but with the word limits, it's too easy to sound ""*jaded*"" when you are talking about overcoming an experience or talking about how a certain experience made you a stronger person. And this is perhaps is key to what many admissions officer are looking at. Those with jaded views have locked down their own potentials. ","2_1_1"

The essay isn't really that important. 

When Michigan tried to get around the ban on quotas by calling it 'critical mass', they assigned 20 points for race but only a few points maximum for the essay.

And, I would point out that this advice to not write about overcoming the barriers of a 1rst gen immigrant only applies to Asian American applicants.

Colleges will deny it, but they're putting a cap on the number of AA applicants so they're comparing AA applicants against each other. We saw that with the Princeton admissions officers who  were comparing applicants to other applicants in the same ethnic group- they were saying stuff like this you don't see a lot of African Americans with scores like this when deciding whether or not to admit an African American student.

Let's say there's an AA applicant who's a first generation Asian American applicant whose family doesn't speak English and who came to this country with no money on a rickety boat fleeing sharks and war. This AA applicant is the first one in his family to go to college, and his parents are low paid cooks in some asian restaurant. 

To the college admission officer, this is going to sound very similar to 
all these other AA applicants with amazing scores who also had to overcome similar obstacles. 

But, if you're a Mexican- Amerian applicant with a similar life story who writes that essay, then the college is going to love that.

The desire to to achieve greater or more ""noble"" things in life is certainly not mutually exclusive with wanting to attend a prestigious school -- in fact those two goals are often aligned. Graduating from a well-connected and brand-name university can open opportunities for young people to do great things. For example, I went to high school with Jeremy Lin who dreamed of playing professional basketball. He attended Harvard and was the star of the Harvard basketball team and now plays in the NBA.

His main piece of evidence was the lack of growth in the Asian-American population at Ivy League schools, despite the growing percentage of college-age Asians nationwide. As a counterexample, he compared Asian enrollment at these schools to Caltech, where they dont have affirmative action:


&gt;There are several flaws with this analysis. It assumes the quality of the Asian applicant pool has stayed the same as the population grows, as Poon points out.


&gt;It also only looks at how many students enroll in the school, and not how many students are admitted to the school. Jenn Fang, who writes at Reappropriate.co, found that the limited growth in Asian-Americans students at Harvard wasnt out of the ordinary:

We are being accurately represented in Ivy League admissions(NOT ENROLLMENT) in correlation to population. 

This means Asian kids are turning down offers to go to Ivy Leagues, maybe to go to a different Ivy League or another college altogether. So really, you should be just yelling at yourselves for not being able to attend multiple colleges (please dont actually do this because some kids will get guilt tripped into doing something that physically impossible because of our weird desire to overchieve while killing ourselves so we can look pretty for the community) so you can boost the AA enrollment percentages for other grumpy Asians who wouldve never made it past the interview phase and has to vicariously live through other people so they can inflate their egos and blame the system for getting rejected.

I wonder if it was because people had an issue with *how* it was implemented rather than whether they agreed with AA or not. Which I think seems to be the consensus with alot of people here too, who aren't opposed to AA but don't like how it's usually implemented (favoring white kids over asians which makes zero sense in the lens of systemic racism). All speculation but maybe people were afraid it was gonna be abused? Personally I was unsure too, there's alot of talk that they would do disaggregation for SEA and not unfairly penalize asians but nowhere in writing or even verbally has anyone guaranteed that they would do that. When asked about asians, senator Steven Bradford basically gave a non answer and said ""oh we'll just address them later but there's more important issues."" 

Talking with some of my latino friends who oppose 16, one point they made was that their UC populations have been growing over the years (i think they now make up the largest percentage) and they're afraid that in a couple of years affirmative action will be used against them too like for asians. I don't necessarily agree but i thought that was an interesting view. Many people, not just asians but latinos too, are disillusioned by what can look like yet another scam by white ppl and rich donors who don't have their best interests in mind. 

PS. The yes on 16 people really fucked up their campaigning. They literally had a 14:1 advantage in funding, tons of endorsements, and still fucked it up by giving vague non answer after answer and strawmanning in their commercials calling anyone who is no on 16 literally the KKK (not really the best way to win over anyone who was still on the fence).","1_1"

A similar measure was attempted (and didn't pass) in Washington with Asians and whites voting primarily against AA. Diversity in higher education doesn't HAVE TO have the same ratio as the general population. 

Some cultures, particularly Asian ones, inherently encourage their people to focus on higher education and doing well in academia while other cultures prioritize entering the workforce earlier.

It's important to recognize some populations are historically disadvantaged and don't have equal opportunities, but at the same time, some schools have higher academic standards than others and some students are more academically focused than others. I don't think flattening the landscape is a good idea, so there has to be some way to match students and schools up. Invariably, that has include some element of merit.

Like another commenter said:

&gt; The end result of AA however is that some people will have to work harder to get the same opportunities simply due to the color of their skin, the very problem it was set out to solve. It simply pushes the hardship from one group to another.

AA is not an appropriate solution. Frankly the problem people seem to have but not want to admit is that there is bias towards caucasians which needs to be addressed, **maybe through pro-minority solutions that doesn't hurt 1 minority in favor of another minority**, rather than trying to make the diversity of higher education align closer to the general population to various minorities' detriment.

I don't 100% disagree with this per se, but I also think there are some complicated issues with this point that I don't have the brainspace to unpack right now? I think my main issue is that the way this point is often utilized goes back to a reductive (and also often racist) ""you [as a person/culture] just need to do better"" when there are bigger, again, structural issues at play. And frankly I think there are a lot of questions to be asked about what the role of college plays in American society and its relation to class and power.

You are correct that UC offers more detailed data somewhere, but the other Asian groups are so small they end up reported as ""other"" by Berkeley, which notably is not included in the URM total.

I absolutely support society becoming generally more knowledgeable about Asian-American history and the stories that come out of different immigrant groups---I think this would also help dispel the model minority myth or the view of Asians as a monolith.

But AA is not about quotas (or so it claims)! It's more about taking the Black underrepresentation as a symptom of the multitude of barriers that Black students face to get into higher education, including barriers in early education, in admissions, in the college experience, and in society in general. It's about acknowledging that those challenges exist, and evaluating Black applicants within that context. 

Wait, you don't think that a lot of the arguments against AA are rooted in white supremacism and racism? Arguments like, ""Why don't Black kids just work harder?"" without acknowledging that society and history are stacked against Black Americans such that it's not even an equal race? I hear a lot, ""We should be aiming for equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome,"" but let's be clear that college admissions is the opportunity, not the outcome. It remains in our country that higher education is a huge stepping stone for socioeconomic advancement, and that's why people are fighting for the spots at the table (and especially at elite universities).

But this reality is exactly what drives so many Asian families to obsess over university prestige. The college crisis has never been about the marquee flagship schools - they're doing just fine. The median UCLA grad has a ticket to a six-figure salary and upper-middle class living.

The problem is with low-ranked schools and community colleges that produce a surplus of grads who never end up using their degree. That's where the perception of college not being ""worth it"" comes from. This also ties back to Prop 22, since plenty of college grads (but probably not the UCLA ones) do drive for Uber or Lyft, which does not require a degree. When you're unable to leverage your human capital in the form of education, you're more screwed than ever.

Honestly?   Unless a white person has proved to you over time they understand how race works in America you should assume they are racist to at least some degree.  Unless they've had some experience that has made them question the white supremacy and their place in it they WILL have some racism in them.  That doesn't mean they are bad people though or don't have the potential to understand but I think this is a safe assumption all non white people in America should operate from.   Once you understand that dealing with and  understanding them becomes way easier. 


I had a black friend from Atlanta, where people sre more openly racially segregated, who moved to the bay area where there is cultural pressure to be not racist, who assumed that because a white person was friendly or talking to him that meant they weren't racist.

By your theory, at best, only the top 50th percentile of whites will not be *overtly* racist.

They say ""don't be so oversensitive"" yet when they go to any Asian country, they whine about being discriminated. There's a difference between being ignorant because of lack of exposure and being intentionally discriminatory. Learn the difference. For the US, it's so nice that you mock Chinese people at an official AP World History testing site. Yes, official.

 It's so nice that you manage to mix up Chinese people and Vietnamese people ( see Lewiston Maine). ""Ho Chi Chin"" is stupid as fuck. And if you know history, a lot of Chinese people came here to get away from the Cultural Revolution, and Vietnamese-Americans are majority refugees that lost everything to the VC regime. Nice.

Just yesterday ago I quickly noped out of a major thread in r/diablo. This ""SJW"" problem is difficult to resolve, partly because you have people lacking in empathic skills, maybe due to limited exposure to American minorities. From a limited vantage point, they tend to make the mistake of prejudging other people's lived experiences, thus accusing SJW's of being extremist, entitled, irrational, and all sorts of other labels.

And partly it's about supposing if SJW's were right - then these people would feel very guilty because they're the ones causing the microaggressions, etc. Instead of being reflective about this like a mature person (and sadly most adults are bad at this too), it's much less effort to rationalize the opposite and hastily conclude that SJW's are clearly crazy. So there may be deep factors such as ego, sense of self-worth, and identity involved in these thought processes in trying to reason about groups of people not like yourself. Humans are flawed like that, in general.

You are 100% correct. My high school is from a very high Asian population city in the Bay Area. When I was a student, I read about ""white flight"" that was happening in our city. White families were getting uncomfortable that more and more Asian families were moving in. As a result, it was harder for people to get good grades since most classes were curved. First they complained to the schools to limit the STEM classes or to make them easier. That didn't work, so they moved away. When I was a student AA population at my hs was 60%. A decade and some later, it's something like 85% now.

I'm actually just comparing Harvard AAs to MIT AAs, as they make up a lot of our applicants over the years.

The MIT students come across as brilliant, no doubt. Always on point and very, very quick with the logic and calculations of the problem. Our brain teasers aren't very hard and they pretty much never get stumped on them. But generally speaking - they can end up speaking too fast and lose coherence, either out of nervousness or overexcitement, they can lose structure and momentum when explaining something, they can get too caught up in details that are interesting but irrelevant.

What's immediate about many of the Harvard students is how damn articulate they are, it honestly sometimes blows my mind (and they end up going to McKinsey or something lol). Very calm, composed in their answers - their weakness (and the weakness of most students anywhere we interview), is typically not having a sufficiently rigorous enough response or messing up the math.

WOW, thank you for giving me a window into the fancy lives of the Asian elite! (Yes, this is sarcasm.)

Let me try to understand your argument. Are you saying that the cultural gap between Asians and whites somehow justifies rejecting Asian applicants? Wouldn't that mean that Asian culture is inferior? It's one thing to say that you have to behave contrary to your upbringing to fit in with corporate America since it's dominated by the white elite, as a practical matter, but shouldn't college admissions be fighting *against* that sort of cultural hegemony? No one would ever suggest that blacks or Hispanics should reject their cultural values in order to conform to what Harvard wants (even if, in practice, they might be forced to do so in order to get ahead in their careers), so why is this a valid point of view for Asians?

No doubt this is because there is surely huge diversity of opinion among the Asian-American alumni; if they want to honestly represent this group, then they cannot come out with a strong position.

The reason why I say that this is unfortunate is that this is exactly why Asians have no political power. Even when it comes to an issue that affects us directly and is extremely important to many of us, we don't stand on one side of it. Consequently, the powers that be can continue to get away with not caring about what we think.","2"

This statement strains to pretend to be objective. It starts with irrelevant criticism of the plaintiff fighting for Asian students, and then pathetically calls Harvard's hired litigation expert an ""outside expert"", as if he was just strolling by and happened to offer his opinion. It thoroughly describes Harvard's case, and never even mentions the plaintiff's. It even tries to pretend that Asians scoring higher on the SAT is somehow possible evidence of Harvard pro-Asian bias, the most comically absurd statement I've ever heard.

They may be trying their hardest to appear bipartisan but:

&gt;For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives.

My personal feeling is that there is nothing wrong with either Asian American or AAPI as an umbrella term, but that's probably because within the AA community *we* know all that ""Asian"" entails. From the outside looking in (or maybe just looking in the general direction), I know that ""Asian American"" can often become short hand for ""only East Asian Americans"".

From the outside looking in, there's NEVER going to be a good umbrella term because it's just thatan umbrella term. I don't think there's really any point in asking if these terms have done us harm because people who don't wish to understand the nuance of our community aren't going to even if we do away with ""AA"" and ""AAPI"" altogether and demand that non-Asians only refer to our communities based on our original ethnic groups. >7<ûB

I guess this just seems silly to me, but maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Certainly, there are a lot of POVs that are covered under the umbrella of Asian diaspora, and I think you have to take statistics/demographic in mind when it comes to internet spaces and mainstream culture. I'm Chinese and find a lot of East Asian diaspora culture unrelatable myself, and I also find a lot of posts on this subreddit unrelatable for various reasons/OPs worldview, etc.

However, even though I don't relate to some East Asian diaspora culture (for example, I've never had boba tea or a lot of other diaspora staples), I also think that complaining about ""boba Asians"" is pretty dumb, and even probably a shitty thing to do. At best, it just smacks of ""not like other girls"" syndrome, and at worst, publicly deriding ""boba Asians"" signals to non-Asians that they can do so as well.","2"

I think you're a particularly perceptive viewer compared to the average American and even r/asianamerican consumer - and maybe you've been a part of Asian diversity in America firsthand. But for those who haven't, most don't know that Asian American is shorthand for only East Asian Americans.

Even for people who do identify with Asian American, I think without a critical opinion, it's easy to lean on the words we have like Asian American and think that one experience is indicative of those who (maybe involuntarily) are lumped in.

I would say my own POV isn't that I reject being American, but only that I merely see being American as my nationality and nothing more. I just happen to have been born here, ""so what""? I could have just as easily been born in China had my parents not moved here. I have knowledge of American culture because I was raised here circumstantially. Still, I don't really fit in culturally to mainstream American culture OR mainstream Asian diaspora/Asian American culture, so to me, even though when I visit China, I'm aware that I don't fit in because I was raised in America, I don't see this as a loss or something I need to react to by embracing or leaning into the ""third culture"" idea.

I think if I was raised in China, I still wouldn't fit in, so I think this is also a thing where personality and your values and perspective of society and community come into play. I KNOW I don't fit in because I can't be bothered/don't care/don't want to, not because I feel that my desire to fit in has been rejected, therefore I'm not broken up about it.

If you also interviewed Harvard Asians (I interviewed both Harvard and MIT kids for my consulting firm), you'd realize there are some wide differences in what each school is looking for as well.

Yes, there are different dreams, interest, personalities, etc. but we do often share broad similarities. How many of us study STEM vs. humanities? How many of us do piano and violin (just look at the orchestras for Ivies)? How few of us pursued a sport to play at super high level? How many of us ran for class president (will give you a hint, most of the ones I know went to Harvard lol). It's the broad similarities, not the smaller differences, that end up making the biggest impact in admissions.

Those proportions matter when you are thinking about the broader dynamics of MIT vs Harvard admissions. Everyone applying to MIT wants STEM, obviously - what you are missing is how that overlaps with those applying to a non STEM focused university. 

You want data? 

[Ok. AAs are dramatically more likely to major and especially graduate in STEM than any other group](https://trends.collegeboard.org/education-pays/figures-tables/students-stem-fields-gender-and-race-ethnicity). Combine that with how much more engineering or CS departments are for schools like GTech, Purdue, UI, or UWashington than their broader universities, and you can see how this generates increased competition all the way up to Harvard (for half the class) and MIT.

[Princeton](http://orchestra.princeton.edu/members/). When you consider how competitive HYP are, and then see how concentrated violin sections are with us, you realize there's a level of homogeneity in our application pool (e.g., consider all the violinists who weren't good enough to play at this level along the distribution curve).

State level sports? C'mon, that's weak. I played at the state level and I'm pretty bad. I know all american AA fencers and swimmers who got into top 10s with 2000-2100 SATs, far below the usual range. Meanwhile, Ivy League athletes are only [\~5% asian](http://web1.ncaa.org/rgdSearch/exec/saSearch), mostly propped up by a few sports like fencing and golf. You watch Jeremy Lin's documentary?

The Chinese American parents that voted for Trump at dinner parties that rail against affirmative action on WeChat? Zero clue about pre-Civil Rights U.S. history, zero clue about Vincent Chin, and limited knowledge of Chinese Exclusion and Japanese internment. These potluck dinner table arguments are illustrative in that they really just become an exposure of ignorance, reducing down to calling top law/med school students ""just kids."" It's only recently as these kids have been putting more work in educating and mixing in some tough love that some of them are becoming more conflicted and learning more - not sure if this happens when the kids are younger and less independent.

&gt;Also, I can't believe that this ""affirmative action helps southeast asians"" trope keeps gaining steam without a shred of evidence going for it. 

Idk, why are these Chinese Americans becoming so vehemently against [disaggregation](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/05/541844705/protests-against-the-push-to-disaggragate-asian-american-data) then? Seems they believe it as well - and it's easy to find examples of it in media and see why. Of course, it could be just related to class as well, but when you consider the diversity reasoning behind more holistic review approaches and everything about the dynamics within Asian Americans, it makes sense as a factor. There are no clinical trials for parachutes, there's no data for evidence-based recommendations for them - doesn't mean they don't work.","3_1_1_1_1_1_2"

&gt;You wanna back Edward Blum take down AA, go ahead. But then don't ever complain about the model minority myth again.

- According to a Google search, Jews are 1.4% of the population and 12% of the student body, so even more ""overrepresented"" than Asians are. What would be the reaction if Jews were inherently rated lower on ""personality"" scores? 

http://www.hillel.org/college-guide/list/record/harvard-university

- Are racial quotas protecting Asian representation in place in any institutions at all? Do we get guaranteed 5% representation in media? Or leadership positions? In government? In sports? Or does the unlikable, not-leader-material, don't-really-trust-this-Asian stereotype follow us everywhere? 

- What if roles were reversed and Black and Latinx student admissions exceeded their % of population in the US. Would Harvard start coming up with arbitrary reasons to get that number down to ""acceptable"" levels? What would the reaction to Harvard intentionally keeping those groups out? 

- I don't give a fuck about Edward Blum. I'm weighing the issue on its merits. Even though I'm politically leftwing, I'm not the type of person to think drone strikes are evil when Bush does it but cool when Obama does it. I view Obama's efforts to normalize relations with Cuba a good thing, and Trump's lowering of tension with North Korea a good thing, even though Trump is evil, an idiot, and someone I despise. At the end of the day, I'm not a partisan. 

Stop ignoring the key issue here, which is that Asians are being punished for being Asian. If they want to enforce a racial quota, then they should come out and say that. That would still be wrong, but more tolerable than the lie. Harvard doesn't get to have it both ways. ","2"

But unfortunately, they are still not able to compete for these limited seats in large number when it comes to SHSAT placement.

For those of you that are unaware NYC high schools are not zoned.  You are allow to rank 21 (or 50? can't remember) high schools you wish to be placed in.  Even the SHSAT high school.  So if you rank an SHSAT high school last, and got a good score on the SHSAT, you might not get an invitation.  I find that scenario rare.  But if you're SHSAT high school bound, ranking the 8 SHSAT high school in a particular order will change the cut off score you need to get an invitation.

The second point I read a lot is some how Asian are cheating by going to private cram or after school programs.  I don't think people are aware of the ""Discovery Program"" where JHS students with high enough grades offered free after school classes to prepare for the SHSAT.  Originally it was only for Blacks and Hispanic students.  That was ruled to be discriminatory, so it's now open to everyone.

The third point, NYC has dozens, if not  hundreds, of charter JHS and HS throughout the city to replace failing public schools.  They have a 5 year charter that allows them to be selective with their student body to keep out problem students.  However, there are reports that even the charter JHS in NYC could not produce students that could get an invitation to Stuyvesant 2 years ago.  Don't know if the situation has changed since then.

This problem get brought up every couple of years.  My take on it is that in NYC minorities make a large population within city government jobs.  So there's political pressure to get something done.  Unfortunately the approach is not effective.  By reintroducing institutional racism to the admission process, just because the institutions are run by a minority group that makes a majority, is not a solution to racism per say.

It is not punishing the privileged to recognize the composite accomplishment of those who had less, and having privilege does not necessitate that you truly are capable of more.

You're confusing talent and outcomes. Talent might never even manifest itself if someone isn't given the opportunities to show off. Mediocrity can be lifted into decently impressive outcomes with enough opportunities and/or money.

Besides, it's a poor comparison. Kobe's one of the best not just because of his innate talent, but because of his work ethic as well.

However, we find the disparities are often **much** larger. So much so that law schools and colleges refuse to publish results of those who are granted admission who fit the affirmative action criteria. We also know that in the top schools a disproportionate amount of those who are let in via affirmative action drop out at much higher rates, graduate with lower gpas, and are much more likely to not further their education in graduate school, or they are more likely to switch to less demanding majors. If you have the tine you could listen to three miles which is a NPR broadcast about talented students from a poor school who are granted access to the top universities via a program.

My point is that an average rich person will look quite impressive outcomes wise. Basically, a 1500 SAT (an outcome) isn't very impressive if you're raised wealthy, because much what's driving it above the average is not necessarily ability (talent) but is also very likely wealth and upbringing.

Again, this is all very STEM biased. And not even STEM departments are always competitive. There are many top schools that are the opposite of hyper competitive.

Base of knowledge? Often times it is precisely student backgrounds that provide the ""base of knowledge"" that drives the campus learning environment or how they contribute to discussions in class.

Maybe you'd like it to be so, but most top universities are not just about academics. Not even Caltech.

What economic metric you use will always have issues - most people would assume income, but a modest income with lots of wealth assets is very different than a high income with little wealth and lots of debt. Not to mention that where you live will change the value of that income substantially (i.e. $100k in San Francisco vs. South Carolina). Plus, the wealth that exists in an extended family can make a huge difference compared to just looking at your parents. The added complication is that some analyses of wealth vs. income show that wealth disparities often fall along race lines differently, so you can't just assume it will all cancel itself out. So you would need administrators to take apart financial aid documents of every single applicant through all these insane nuances, which in these schools with like a 5% admission means 20 in-depth reviews for every admittance (you can maybe weed them out by grades/essays first, but either way you'll still need to hire more administrative staff).

Colleges want *unique* individuals so if you grew up in an nice, middle class family and did nothing but study study study throughout high school to get a 4.0+ GPA and 2000+ SAT scores then youre no different from 90% of the applicants top colleges receive. Colleges make you write essays in your applications for a reason and if the only interesting thing you have to talk about is how your mandatory high school community service changed your life then youre just the same boring carbon copy of every student theyve been admitting for decades. Its not hard to get good scores when your upbringing gives you the privilege of a comfortable life to focus solely on school with every resource available for you to succeed.

However a lot of minority student (specifically black and Latino) grow up in low-income neighborhoods where graduating high school is a big challenge. A lot of people like to look at scores and say hey this black kid had a 3.9 GPA and a 1900 SAT score. The *only* reason they were accepted is because of their race when in reality they grew up with a single parent who was barely around because they were working two jobs and the kid had to get a job as a teen to help support the family while growing up in a gang infested neighborbood with terrible public schools. So that minority kid may have lower stats on average but had to put 10x as much effort as the average, middle class kid which makes them stand out and look incredibly impressive to colleges.

Basically, Im saying college essays matter because they who you are outside of those numbers and if your life painfully average then your essays are most likely going to be boring. You cant just compare numbers because colleges want to see who you are as a person.

Lets even take into consideration the fact that Southeast Asians have a significantly higher amount of high school drop out rates than most other AAPIs due to poor home conditions or poor minority support in the USA due to being Asian. Should a college admission office see a SEAA apply with lower than the average Asian American SAT scores and GPA and consider their SEA background?

&gt; It's not like there's a shortage of poor people from other racial backgrounds.

How do you know that poor people from other backgrounds arent being helped? Im sure their hardships are taken into account in their college essays and interviews. Currently black and Latino people suffer from poverty the most in America which is why colleges take their backgrounds into account the most. 

However, it is worth noting that the poverty many black Americans suffer is a direct result of their race. There are millions of black people who alive today who grew up during Jim Crow laws along with millions of  black people today who legally werent allowed to buy a house in the 70s because of housing discrimination. The poverty they and their families suffer today is very different from what a white family suffers.

No, they can just become more well rounded. A lot of the college advice I was given in high school is that grades and scores arent enough. You need to be well-rounded. Asian kids who grew up in a nice life should join clubs, play sports, take on leadership roles in organizations, but so many Asian parents thinks grades are the only thing that matters and dont let their kids do anything other than study. No one is being punished for giving their kids a good life but the bottom line is that if your parents have money then your life is easier and you have access to more resources. People have no problem acknowledging this when it comes to Rich vs Middle class but for some reason get offended when its middle class vs lower class.

They definitely would get a boost if their college essays reflect the hardships they went through as a low-income Asian American.

BTW, these rulings about AA specifically deal with race. Using other factors like personality tests, social factors, income, etc. all potentially impact race but according to the Supreme Court, they are all fair game.

&gt; Affirmative action, whatever the rationale, has also never been the only, or even the most important, advantage in college admissions. Luke Harris, a Vassar professor, and Kimberlé Crenshaw, a professor at Columbia University and UCLAboth critical-race-theory pioneershave noted that what got lost in the University of Michigan fight was that students were also awarded 10 points for attending elite high schools, eight points for taking a certain number of AP courses, and four points for being legacies. Thats 22 points that certain affluent and middle-class students had built in that poor, first-generation college students had little or no access to. This structure rewarded students who already benefited from living in upscale neighborhoods, who had successful parents or parents who, at the very least, knew how to succeed in the system, and who continued to benefit from the affirmative action of not descending from people who for generations were banned from reading, buying property, and living in safe neighborhoods with decent schools.

While I don't agree with the diversity rationale, this has got to be one of the most absurd characterizations of AA I've ever heard. It's nothing but a net positive for the people who benefit because all it does is give the more choice.

If they want to attend an elite school that's not as diverse, that's their choice. If they want to choose a less prestigious but more racially diverse school, that's still an option. Nobody is demanding that these students engage in a particular environment or be educators to white people.","3_1"

Or is this article sort of just interpreting generic 'diversity' as meaning that? I wasn't aware that people thought about diversity that way.

The idea of reparations makes sense, in that a society should 'compensate' people who have been treated badly for reasons that were wrong in retrospect. In that sense Asians should benefit too, especially the students that didn't grow up with highly educated parents, etc. The word 'reparations' seems to have a bad connotation though, as a blanket benefit for everyone of a certain race, whereas I think most people would agree that affirmative action would be better administered looking at individuals' specific background.

This reminds me of the article about who benefits from elite college educations ([https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/12/does-it-matter-where-you-go-college/577816/)). A more cynical/rational way to look at a benefit of affirmative action is that it increases the number of people in society who go on to high-value activities. The white guys will get into good jobs regardless of where they go to school, but only an elite education boosts minorities into similar jobs. So affirmative action -&gt; the greatest marginal benefit to society. I'm not sure where that argument fits on the spectrum of whether affirmative action benefits white people or the minorities.","5"

They shouldn't have used CA, affirmative action is actually banned. CSU generally accept everyone in the surrounding community. UC limit their Asian American population unintentionally.

In addition, hypothetically in terms of number and their scale unit, UC has a quota of top 20 of each high school, that would limit Asian-American since Asian-Americans generally congregate in one area.

I have a problem with what she says here. ""Resentment and social peace"" are not great reasons to cull the potential of asian kids. I see the need for affirmative action.

That said, I'd raise two concerns about Prof. Gersen's argument. I get that when Prof. Gersen is expressing her personal opinion that a Stuyvesant demographic is undesirable for Harvard, but I think in saying that she fails to see the radical alternativesuppose that Harvard quickly became a majority Asian student body. That would be amazing. But she says no, that would be socially unstableI see that sort of appeal/dismissal as a choice or failure to to consider and confront the final implication of her otherwise clear reasoning, which really has this alternative, radical interpretation as a last step.

I think the other issue is that the author doesn't seem to see that the effective racial/Asian balancing is an artifact of the system of quota doctrine + holistic-intangible evaluation. She says that race-conscious affirmative action is not a suitable point of intervention (sure, reasonable) but then says there is ""sub-rosa deployment of racial balancing"", which is equivalent to saying there's a conspiracy to do so. There's no conspiracy; social theorists say that modern discrimination happens structurally and to fix it you have to intervene at the level of structures. So pessimistically, I think getting Harvard to do anything will not work because they have no incentive to break the structure.

Her final message of hope, that regardless of this stuff is improving for Asian Americans anyways, is also heartening to read.

2. What is the relevance of cross applying? What matters here is how seats at a school are distributed. Ivies can only be ~50% STEM, Caltech can be 100% STEM. If a significant number of asian americans are going into STEM (which they are), of course this is going to matter.

Both articles go into the stats for legacy admissions as well as the ethnic make-up for legacy admissions.

If you then look at 
https://www.princeton.edu/~tje/files/webAdmission%20Preferences%20Espenshade%20Chung%20Walling%20Dec%202004.pdf, a study by Thomas Espenshade, Chang Chung and Joan Walling, the estimated effect of Legacy Admissions is +160 to SAT score, while the estimated effect of being Asian in Affirmative Action is -50. So, the magnitude of the effect is larger.

What studies do you see that say AA is worse than legacies? I'm interested.

EDIT: A big thing that just occured to me. An argument is always that legacy admissions are such as small part of the overall class that they don't matter. I disagree, because I've seen legacy admit numbers tend to be in the 5-10% range of the entire student body, which, while small taken alone, makes all the difference. For example, AAs make up 6% of the student body at Penn state. There are probably more Legacy Admits than Asian-American students at Penn State.

But this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, because you're comparing legacies to non-legacies in one and two AA non-beneficiaries in the other. It's not as if Asian Americans only lose when it's whites who are advantaged.

&gt;According to this Harvard's undergrad is 12-13% legacy admits.

Okay, by using your own sources, we can say that there is a 160-point legacy impact effecting 12-13% of the class (a little more or less depending on how yield differs between legacies and non-legacies). Note that I am accepting as an implicit assumption that Asian Americans do not enjoy any of this advantage granted to legacy applicants, which seems rather implausible.

Your same sources and Harvard's website also inform us that there is a 280-point AA impact affecting 14.6% of the class (black student-body percentage for the most recent class) and a 235-point AA impact affecting 11.6% of the class (same as above but for Hispanics).","10_2_1_1"

Yes. Legacy Admits are overwhelmingly white.

Source please? My source says that being black is a 140 point increase on the SAT compared to white. (This, by the way, is less than the Legacy effect.)

The government of Mao Zedong deemed his family capitalists and imprisoned his father.

So when Mr. Li moved to California in 1999, he felt he had found his American dream. He worked hard and earned his rewards: a masters degree, then a job that allowed him to live comfortably with his wife and two children.

But four years ago, he became alarmed when a co-worker told him about a state measure that would allow Californias public universities to use affirmative action in their admissions. Fearing that this would hurt his childrens educational chances, Mr. Li for the first time in his life became politically active.

He signed a petition and donated money to a campaign to stop the affirmative action measure. He sped up his timeline to become a citizen so that he could vote. He campaigned for Republican candidates for the State Legislature. More recently, he took the lead of a local Chinese-American political action committee, called The Orange Club, which is now focused on supporting California Republican candidates in the midterms.

We just realized if were not involved in this process, the political process in America, we would be forgotten, Mr. Li said.

Mr. Li, 49, is among an increasingly vocal group of Chinese-Americans who were once politically dormant but have been galvanized by the fight over race-based school admissions.

From Irvine to Houston to the Washington suburbs, Chinese activist groups like The Orange Club are beginning to capture the attention of lawmakers and influence policy debates. Much of their political activity can be found on the Chinese social media network WeChat, where the activists share articles and spread their message. And they have a clear litmus test for any politician seeking their support: opposition to affirmative action.

Their numbers are small compared with the overall population of China-born immigrants, which has exploded over recent decades, from about 472,000 in 1980 to more than 2.8 million in 2016, according to Andrew Beveridge, a professor at Queens College, based on census data.

But a number of recent fights over education have highlighted their growing political clout. Dozens of Chinese-American groups helped draft a complaint filed with the Justice Department in 2015 that accuses Harvard of discriminating against Asian-Americans in admissions. They were on the front lines of protests several weeks ago when Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York proposed changing the admissions criteria for his citys specialized high schools, where Asian-Americans account for more than half the population.

The activists have yielded victories. In California, they helped defeat the affirmative action measure, known as S.C.A. 5. And in New York, the Brooklyn borough president, Eric Adams, initially supported Mr. de Blasios plan, only to backtrack after the uproar led by Chinese-Americans.

The debate over race in education centers on how much schools should try to control their racial makeup. At many elite universities and specialized high schools, black and Hispanic students are underrepresented, while Asian and white students are overrepresented relative to their overall population.

Activists like Mr. Li worry that if schools calibrate their student ratios around race, Asian students are most likely to lose out.

The Orange Club grew out of a group of mostly Chinese-American mothers in Orange County who helped new immigrants navigate the school system and the community. When the affirmative action measure emerged in 2014, several parents in the group began asking what they could do to stop it, said Sarah Yang, who was among those who then founded The Orange Club.

Ms. Yang has a 19-year-old son who will be a sophomore at the University of Chicago, and a 16-year-old daughter who is entering 11th grade in high school.

While the University of Chicago was one of her sons top choices, Ms. Yang said that there were other elite schools he did not get into.

Nobody knows for sure what played a role in the decision making, she said. But I think in general, race is a part of the equation. How significant, we dont know. We all understand for Asian kids you must do better in every way in order to get into college compared to other races.

Ms. Yang said her daughter is mindful of the high standards she faces as an Asian-American to get into elite colleges, and she places extra pressure on herself.

Thats something that I feel thats not fair in a way, Ms. Yang said. They have to work extremely hard in order to get into their dream school.

[Read about the Z-list, and other ways of getting into Harvard that it doesnt want you to know about.]

Ms. Yang said she was familiar with racial struggle. She had to overcome a lot of challenges to become the vice president of engineering at a technology company dominated by white men. Schools, she said, should be the great equalizer, a place where your race or gender should not give you an advantage.

But affirmative action turned that notion on its head, Ms. Yang said. Of S.C.A. 5, she said, I didnt think that the U.S. could have such an unfair bill.","5"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/967i7r/they_left_china_to_chase_the_american_dream_now/","unkle","2018-08-10",1533912141,4,4,0,0,"During the fight over the measure, Ms. Yang and other Chinese-Americans in Orange County held meetings, handed out fliers and signed online petitions. They protested in front of the office of Assemblyman Ed Chau, who eventually broke with his fellow Democrats and came out against the bill.

In late 2014, the group interviewed and endorsed four Republican candidates for the State Legislature who opposed affirmative action. It enlisted dozens of volunteers to campaign for them. All four candidates, none of them incumbents, won.

They were a constant presence in my campaign office, said Young Kim, a Republican who unseated an incumbent Democratic assemblywoman and is now running for Congress. This was the first time that I knew that there were very active Chinese-American parents that were organizing this movement, specifically to fight against S.C.A. 5.

Even after winning the fight in California, Mr. Li and other activists remain wary. Mr. Li said it was important to prevent Democrats in the California Legislature from gaining a supermajority that could allow them to pass a bill reinstating affirmative action. He said he was still worried about what the future held for his 13-year-old son, despite his strong academic performance.

I think for him its going to be really, really tough if nothing is changed in current college admissions system policies and practice, he said. As an Asian male, its going to be very tough for him to get admitted to a top, elite school.

His daughter is entering her senior year pursuing environmental studies at the University of California, Berkeley  a college Mr. Li said he did not think she would have gotten into if affirmative action had returned to California.

For many Chinese families, a focus on education is deeply rooted in the tradition they came from.

The civil service exam was a staple of Chinese governance for more than 1,000 years, leading to the rise of a gentry class of bureaucrats who supplanted aristocrats with inherited privileges. The test was a powerful engine of social mobility. The exam was abandoned in 1911, when the Qing imperial dynasty was overthrown.

Later, under Mao and during the massive upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, most schools were closed. When they reopened after the movement ended in 1976, it was clear just how much the country yearned for education. More than 11 million students flocked to take the college entrance exams over the next two years.

Chinese-Americans, most of whom voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, are split on whether to support affirmative action. Their support for it has fallen in recent years, from 78 percent in 2012 to 41 percent in 2016, according to the National Asian-American Survey. Among other Asian-Americans over that time, backing for affirmative action has remained consistent, at nearly three in four.

Alex T. Tom, the executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association in San Francisco, said that he supports affirmative action because he believes that Asian-Americans, like others, benefit from learning in diverse environments.

The son of a Chinese father and Taiwanese mother, Mr. Tom, 42, said he did not get into his two top college choices  the University of California, Berkeley and the University of California, Los Angeles. But he did go to the University of California, San Diego, where he said he was exposed to racially diverse communities.

There are benefits of living in a pluralistic society, he said. And theres benefits that I gained from being able to have a suite mate who was black, and also someone who was Latino and white.

And he said that while some Chinese immigrants may feel that they can overcome potential discrimination by having degrees from elite institutions, they would still face racism.

Youre still, no matter what, seen as kind of like an other in this country, he said.

One argument for affirmative action is that it would help correct for the harm done to generations of African-Americans who have faced systemic racism.

But a number of other Chinese-American activists said they believed that race-based admissions were one of the few things in the United States that represented true discrimination. Tony Xu, a member of the Silicon Valley Chinese Association, said he was not so sure about other allegations of racism.

Inside peoples minds, maybe theres something still there, he said. Systematically theres no discrimination. I dont believe that; I dont feel that.

Instead, activists said the slights they experience  whether its someone mocking their accent or the shape of their eyes  are limited to personal interactions.

We never feel like this is something the whole society is doing, Ms. Yang said. You just more feel like this is just one person. We dont really feel it is the system that created that discrimination.

For some of the activists, their political work has led them to take up other issues. In Maryland, a sanctuary city measure proposed in 2017 failed after a Chinese activist group protested it. The law would have barred the use of state and local funds to aid federal immigration enforcement. The Chinese-Americans in opposition said that since they had followed this countrys immigration law and waited patiently for citizenship, others should, too.

The Orange Club is now focused on helping Republicans win in midterm races this fall. Orange County is host to a number of competitive House races, and the group is also supporting John Cox, the Republican candidate for governor of California.

In June, a post on an Orange Club page sought to rally volunteers to help in the final days of the congressional primary campaign of Bob Huff, a Republican and former state senator. The article asked followers to add their names to the post if they could help. Twenty-eight people signed up for what was ultimately an unsuccessful campaign.

Lets not forget that Bob Huff was alone fighting against S.C.A. 5 in the California Senate in 2014, the post read, adding that it was time to pay him back with tangible action. God helps those who help themselves. Helping Bob Huff is helping the Chinese people ourselves.","5_1"

The Chinese-Americans in opposition said that since they had followed this countrys immigration law and waited patiently for citizenship, others should, too.","7"

edit: apparently people disagree. i am going to make points rather than write coherent   
- i'd be curious how this argument would go in 1990s when colleges didn't have need based financial aid  
- this seems like this anti affirmative action attitude when in reference to ivy league schools when you could go to liberal arts colleges or out of state somehwere. obsession is only built on prestige  
- this seems to me like upper middle class dilemma. you're not rich like the kushner's and you can buy your way in or you're not getting into the appropriate feeder schools because you don't qualify. there are programs like prep for prep which can get you into a prep school if you're poor  
- the comparison to jewish people. sure similarities but although they were considered not part of mainstream in europe (ghettos, pogroms, holocaust). in america they probably assimilated because they did not look black and america has legally isolated african americans. but still anti semitism existed in admissions until i guess it didnt? i think there's clearly anti AAPI sentiment in admissions office
- admissions office are mostly white. why would you expect them to understand AAPIs?  
- ultimately ivies and other elite institutions could admit more AAPIs, but ultimately they want grads who bring prestige or donate money
- also i find this obsessions with certain schools is probably not good for mental health. i feel like AAPIs have difficulty with reaching out for help and this pressure to go to these schools. parents want people to be secure in a job, but seems like development of other skills is lacking. in america there are many to choose, but in other countries there is not  
- I'm filipino and growing up my parents wanted to have secure career. Dad wanted me to go into the Navy when I graduated or they even suggest being a postal worker (which is popular FilAm career) or even a priest. So there wasn't an emphasis to go to college, only if I wanted to. For me it seems like other SEAs of all sorts don't even graduate HS so they're not even in the conversation.   
- Also I feel like American universities and colleges are for acclimating white kids to PoCs.
