Another good technique that I learned from Toastmasters is to say, in what appears to be an effort to emphasize ones point, Let me repeat that.  Then the speaker restates what he or she had just said while trying to regroup his or her thoughts.  From the perspective of the audience, it appears as though the speaker is really just trying to emphasize his or her point.

At college age and professional problems, it should come down to the best of the best then and you wont have to worry about race. It should be blind at this point of life. 

This will never happen though because it is far more expensive and would require a large restructure of our society. But I dont think affirmative action is the right band-aid in the meantime!","66"

The 14th Amendment prohibits *de jure* discrimination based on race, not discrimination based on any factor that has a disparate *de facto* impact on different races. The law would be a freaking nightmare if it were otherwise, with courts sitting in constant judgment of every law to assess whether every race and other suspect classification benefits equally.

That doesn't mean CRT is wrong that legacy admission policies perpetuate historical inequalities, but there is no basis *in the law* for prohibiting that. IMO, Congress could pass such a law under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, but they haven't. Courts have to decide cases based on the law. I think I would support a law that required universities to make admission decisions based solely on individual merit (and not how much daddy donated).  Maybe AOC should draft one, instead of disingenuously suggesting that SCOTUS should invent one.","3_4_2"

To actually answer your question, you would need to look at more than just general population statistics. Youd have to look at the very rich/legacy admissions per institution and compare to other industries. 

What were talking about here is very similar to nepotism in Hollywood or in other industries (automotive, small business, etc. - how following in your familys footsteps is easier once your family achieves success; e.g., where employees get frustrated because their boss employs their family/close friends instead of people who are actually qualified). 

This is going to have impacts on the business world as well, as you arent allowed to discriminate due to gender, race, age, religion, etc. but Im some industries they do push for including other backgrounds because of affirmative action. This will make it easier to discriminate early on in the hiring process. I think we will see another case in the next few years about this, and it wouldnt surprise me if they use this as precedent to allow discrimination in hiring employees, making it easier to hire who you want without taking into account how qualified the candidates are and what they might bring to your company that would make it more successful (rather than, for example, not hiring women because they might get pregnant).","3_6_1"

For example, we have elite private institutions, public flagships, and big name universities that were segregated until the 1960s. My grandparents were college aged in the 1960s.

Harvard has been around since 1636 (it is the oldest university and oldest incorporated entity in the country) and many other Ivies and almost Ivies were founded within 150 years of Harvard. Assuming a generation is 25 years, that is 10-16 generations of potential White legacy admits. Even with the public flagships like my alma mater LSU (founded in 1860), had its first group of six Black undergraduate students in 1964.

Affirmative action started due to the repression of blacks in both civil rights and economic opportunity. No shit its racially based, because it had to be to address the 200 years of racially based actual and economic slavery of black Americans. 

This is just the same BS rationale that Robert's used to gut the voting rights act. ""It's not needed anymore"". Yah tell that to minority voters in Georgia, Texas, Florida, NC and SC, Louisiana and others.

And as to whether it's needed, black and Hispanic students are way more likely to say yes than white or Asian.

And given how schools grant aid, we are in for a shitshow.

""William Bowen and Derek Boks book The Shape of the River systematically looks at the impact of affirmative action by exploring decades of data from a group of selective colleges. 

They find that black students who probably benefited from affirmative action  because their achievement data is lower than the average student at their colleges  do better in the long-run than their peers who went to lower-status universities and probably did not benefit from affirmative action. 

The ones who benefited are more likely to graduate college and to earn professional degrees, and they have higher incomes.

Anyway...let's go back to the gender/race equity conversation here.

Because it's being purposely put aside.

""Meritocracy"" presumes on its face that the playing field is already level.  That's not the case for race or for gender.  Not even close.  White men hold an overwhelming inherent and presumed advantage in our society.

Let's not pretend that even with objective balancing against racism and sexism that objective and subjective sexism and racism don't overwhemingly disadvantage women and minorities (and especially minority women).  

So...why is it when we have Title IX (which is a set aside of funding for womens activities even though those activities don't generate the same revenue &amp; interest as mens) or corporate targets to have 50% women in executive roles, that these don't challenge that holy meritocracy the same as race based programs that do exact same thing?

""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financialassistance.""(reddit wont let me put a link but search title ix and click the department of education page)

if you have some source to backup your claim about title ix ""Set aside of funding..."", please reply with it, and I will take a look.

Also, if white people hold the ""overwhelming advantage"" in our society, then why is it that asians are discriminated against the most in affirmative action? Asians are also a group that have been historically discriminated against.

honestly, I'm not convinced they wouldn't remain powerful \*anyways\*, but they just wouldn't pretend that Harvard is the reason they got to where they are and would make up something else.

Like... Bush jr without having gone to Yale is still the son of a president and the grandson of a senator, that in and of itself carries a \*lot\* of privilege and connections even without the ivy league. And Kushner likely would still have had the rich boy privilege of being son of Charles Kushner and the son in law of a US president.

Jared didn't get his position at the White House because he went to Harvard, and Dubya didn't get a cushy gig in the Texas air national guard during Vietnam or elected governor of Texas and President because he went to Yale. Their family members seemed a hell of a lot more important on that front.

I feel that people looked at the fact that a lot of powerful people went to a school for rich kids and instead of concluding ""they are powerful because they're rich and were born into rich and powerful families"" concluded ""the school must have given them that wealth and power"" which is the exact opposite of reality.","2_2"

But Im thinking the University loves a legacy student because its the best way to squeeze out guaranteed money.

The parent or whatever relative already graduated from that university, they already got the money for that degree when it was way cheaper than it is now. If that Alumni has donated money it should be a guaranteed admission because Well they gave us money before when they didnt have a kid or nephew or whatever here, better admit that kid so they keep shelling out money on top of the tuition. 

And Im betting a legacy is less likely to drop out or transfer due to the pressure from their family& well Uncle Bill graduated from, MIT, UCLA, OSU, Harvard, Tennessee Tech State University Tech (yeah two techs in that one) you get the point&so you better not let us down

So instead of someone being admitted and potentially dropping out after a first semester I bet theres a better chance a legacy stays there for four years and the university gets four years of money.

When all kinds of restrictions were placed on voting rights after the 15th Amendment was passed (literacy tests and poll taxes) legislators realized a lot of poor white people would be excluded by the restrictions, too, so they made an exception. If your grandfather voted, you were automatically registered to vote. Of course, this could never apply to the first generation of Black voters nor would it apply to subsequent generations in any significant numbers.

Legacy admissions are similar in that the vast majority of admissions were officially raced-based (and sex-based) for many schools before 1954 and unofficially before affirmative action was mandated in the 1960s and 70s. Essentially, allowing legacy admissions is grandfathering in people who may otherwise be excluded.","30"

If you can't illegally segregate school specifically by race there are other legal ways to do so.

Bus routes, school funding tied to property taxes...poor individuals (who are generally POC more often in cities) can't afford to move to certain districts. Then you take into account decades of unfair real estate practices that prevented POC getting housing loans or moving into predominantly white neighborhoods.

This happened in my city when they opened a brand new school that took students away from the one in my rural town. Parents who could drive their kids to school or could move to the district did... primarily white.

This crippled the school that used to be diverse and effectively ""segregated"" it.

Obviously there's correlation there, the white poverty rate is something like 9% while the Hispanic and black poverty rates are about twice that and the Native American poverty rate is even higher. 

But the thing is, those wealthy suburban districts don't want poor white kids either. There are some pockets of the country were racism is deep rooted and even cultural, and those areas are the exception. In the areas where racism is more passive or institutional (as in, people don't believe they are racist, but their actions and customs are not inclusive), people would generally prefer to have a middle class suburban black student who dresses like their kids and has similar interests over a white kid from an inner city neighborhood or a poor rural community.

But you will be way off base if you didn't think race was a primary reason behind much of this BS. I'm not sure why you think it has to be black and white?

One of the biggest reason POC are in the socioeconomic position they're in is because of decades of systemic racism. Then civil rights happened and you can't target specifically based on race....so of course you target people by the amount of wealth(or lack of) they have.

And yes, racism caused unequal opportunities for decades and led to economic inequality today. So it's fair to say that racism is a root cause of the issue.

But what I'm saying is that most Americans don't view themselves as racist. Our wealthiest school districts are in suburban areas that overall are welcoming to people of color, provided they conform with suburban values. Conversely, they would not be supportive of white students who do not conform with suburban values. 

So, the segregation policy is the same, but the target group has changed - the divisive factor is not exclusively racism, but also, and in my opinion more centrally, economic status and conformity.","2_1_1_1_6_2_1"

If you think about that for about two seconds, the families that encourage their kids into either of those tracks are mostly upper middle class and from the suburbs. The kids also happen to be mostly white and Asian and to get good grades and test scores.

So Los Angeles Unified School District locates all of its magnet programs in underperforming inner-city schools with strongly Black and Latino student bodies. It's a bad look to have those inner-city schools always struggling along with low test scores; it shows racial disparities in opportunity. So they use the magnet programs as a smoke screen. They don't pool the fundingthe kids in the magnet programs are in their own, separate, smaller classrooms with their own separate teachersbut they can kinda pool the test scores and demographic information. So my high school, on paper, wasn't a majority Black and Latino school with dismal test scores, it was a racially diverse school with about 10% high-performing students.

Youd have to look more closely at the data (if you can get your hands on it) but what I suspect is that Harvard has their pick of the litter so they get the best African American students by merit.  

UNC has fewer of the world class black students to choose from and even with a little extra push from AA they cant quite match Harvards numbers in a state with 22% black population.  IMO, Berkeley shows what UNC might look like without AA.  Remove the most elite black students and the next cohort down has a tougher time competing with other Asians and Whites purely on merit.

is not how affirmative action works. the decision can not turn entirely or primarily on the issue of race, this has been the case since at least 2003 and even before that, that's (mostly) not how it worked. where race is considered it's already kind of a different beast and i can get into the history both judicially and in practice on that but i'll spare you for the moment (unless you really want.) the construction where it *does* work like that is basically a concession to conservative rhetoric like fighting the argument on wokeness or esg or any other structure where there are a lot of principles, some real some not, all grouped under the same (rhetorical) umbrella so it's possible to endlessly dodge any real engagement or argument while riling people up.","18_1_2_1"

and get this: multiple solutions to racial and economic inequality can be deployed at the same time. giving minorities access to higher education helps prevent further disparities down the line. college education = higher-paying/more jobs, lower risk of incarceration, etc. if a schools student body is overwhelmingly white and asian, what do you think happens then (especially in industries dominated by alumni of elite schools)? and what does that mean for student life for the few minorities still enrolled? at the same time, we can still fix the root issues of segregation, redlining, general racism, etc., but those solutions take much longer and much more effort. college only takes 4 years.

I don't think anywhere near enough urgency is given to the issue of segregated and underfunded communities.

This is a man-made problem. By design of lunatic racists of the past 150 years. Wtf! There's faaaaaar more than enough money to fix the issue. You fix it, and racial issues will largely fix themselves. You want equal opportunity? Start at the very beginning, make sure minorities are born into safe and comfortable homes. If this was given due attention affirmative action would not even be on the docket.

This has the potential to change my mind. If the fast tracked minority students perform st the same level as their university peers, then I believe affirmative action may be viable. Do you have any source on this, especially one that cross examines it with the allegations of a trend for the inflation of minority grades in universities? There are a lot of papers written on general grade inflation in universities, which is very real, so do consider that when assessing performance of contemporary uni students. Here's an interesting one that I read today researching your reply https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://ojed.org/index.php/hepe/article/download/5088/2489&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjn-cKri-3_AhWPR8AKHWprBuIQFnoECCkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw26hBeHOjLW9ac7oLUtKBPv though it provides contradictory evidence to certain minorities being able to 'keep up', on page 47, this is in no way the definitive paper on the subject.","30_1_1_1_1"

diversity admissions are no more unethical than athletics admissions (and definitely more ethical than legacy). athletes are ACTUALLY known to have lower stats, lower admissions standards, then lower college GPAs, many getting recruited even before their senior year of high school. but colleges have a compelling interest to have athletes at their school, just like they have a compelling interest to have a racially diverse student body (for student life as well as social justice, if they care). these students are qualified because, on top of meeting the standards, the college wants them to be there.


you keep going back to underfunded communities& still not the point. multiple solutions to racial inequality can implemented at the same time. AA works faster and fights the same problem at a different level. if you give a generation of minorities a college education, they earn more money and can enter politics. the alumni have the jobs and financial stability to give back to their communities. also, todays politicians do not care about black and brown communities; theyre underfunded for a reason. college-educated minority politicians do care.

moreover, the AA case wouldnt be on your precious supreme court docket if people werent fighting it. AA was purely in the hands of universities and was not taking away the governments time or resources until people made it that way. so maybe if people fought underfunding instead of AA&

im not even gonna validate the allegations of a trend for the inflation of minority grades. its wild and makes little sense. most college professors do not care about students, let alone care about promoting AA by picking out minority students to raise their grades. and page 47 of that article doesnt offer evidence of minorities not keeping up. it provides two instances and says, We are less concerned about occasional instances that gain national attention than the everyday normative atmosphere from which such cases arise. i could also provide two instances of professors saying they hate minorities and give them lower grades. means nothing.","30_1_1_1_1_1"

The obvious and recently shared counterpoint being, not all public education systems which ar foundational for educational development are equal. In fact schools within the same district can be tragically unequal when it comes to the quality of education for young people.

Grades play a part, but the deciding factor comes down to race. Thats the problem. You shouldnt have to say to an Asian student of immigrant parents, who is from a low socioeconomic class, has dealt with racism, stereotypes, and significant disadvantages. That, while your grades are good they arent good enough for an Asian applying, but if you were black or indigenous or Latino than you would have been accepted.

This argument is the reason affirmative action was created in universities like Harvard and UNC. I dont know why you would want to continue with a policy that was created because universities believed black students were not good enough to succeed only on their academic merits.

It is though the goal of affirmative action as used by Harvard was race. It was not about where you grew up, what school you went to, if you were wealthy or poor, whether you went to a 50k a year private school or a public school that has some of the lowest funding. It was race.

1. You are literally justifying the same thing you are upset about. You are listing all the reasons why a black person could be disadvantaged, and because of that they deserve to be treated like their race is more important than their grades, that they need affirmative action in order to get into Harvard. That they deserve to be treated differently on the basis of race.

2. You are assuming that what has happened to some black people has happened to all and that they are all equally deserving solely because they are black. That a black teenager who who has wealthy parents, who recently immigrated to America, lives in a mansion, went to a private boarding school, has good grades, has access to academic help, has a good support system. That because they are black they are equally as deserving as an black teenager who grew up in poverty,  raised by their grandparents because their parents were killed, lived in a crime ridden neighbourhood, went to a bad school, had teachers that didnt care, were frequently harassed by police for fitting a stereotype, worked a job on evenings and weekends, yet studied there ass off to get food grades.  That these two people from two completely different backgrounds are equally deserving even though one of them has no relation to past indiscretions against black people in America.

3. You are lumping all black people into the same category that they are descendants of slaves, that all of them are denied they same things, that they are all from communities destroyed by violence. You are literally stereotyping black people into 1 category, and that wrongdoings to some members of the black community past or present, defines all black people.

4. A majority of what you are mentioning is related to socioeconomic status, yes more black people are likely to be of a low or medium socioeconomic class. 

      Not all black people are poor
      Not all poor people are black 

     Are people who come from a low               socioeconomic class less deserving than a   black person, because they are black? Because that what your comment implies.


5. Do you want to know another group of people that America treated poorly? Japanese Americans. In the 1940s the American government forcefully removed them from their homes and placed them in internment camp. they were forced to work often in fields on farms, their homes were seized, they were viewed as enemies. Dozens of people were confined to single rooms, some were killed if they tried to leave, they faced racism, discrimination for decades.

Yet somehow, even though America treated Japanese Americans like gum on their shoe, you dont seem to have any issues with Harvard discriminating against Japanese Americans. You dont appear to be at all concerned that an African American is more likely to be accepted into Harvard than a Japanese American. Even though that Japanese American has significantly higher grades, and has faced significant challenges because of how the United States treated them. 

May I also suggest looking into Americas treatment towards Chinese immigrants and the treatment of Asian Americans from the Middle East, because obviously they are all terrorists

What exactly is the relevance to this? Nobody is saying that we should have legacy admissions. In fact, the tweet literally says we shouldnt. 

But your reasoning is still incredibly flawed. You are trying to justify affirmative action because there is something worse. That its okay to discriminate against asians, because legacy admissions allow a lot of rich white people in.  Both can be wrong, both are wrong.

also, you don't happen to know about a little book called the poisoning of beverly hills high school would you? in short, it is about how the school had nine oil wells underneath it and the off-gassing caused cancer to the students. the school also won lots of money for the oil wells being there and then the cancer they caused from improper safety with the toxins they caused. that school also has a history of diversity which the show 90210 misrepresented. the school has had around 35% of its student body from overseas. it also has had a bout a 70% caucasian student body but since when did caucasian mean american?

did you assume that they just got extra money because they were considered elite? that would be nonsense. that area probably used to get paid because they not only had oil wells they could see while driving by but also because of the risk in living there. native alaskans get checks frequently for allowing the drilling of oil in alaskan lands... i know that personally. it is very possible that the other school mentioned also gets extra funding for something similar like an annual payment from lawsuits or local programs.

yes, systemic racism exists and is all over the place. but don't make them up from every thing you see as unequal. i bet you would be fine not getting that extra money if you could reduce the exposure to cancer causing toxins right?","37_1_1"

A good example would be if a college admission sees two similar candidates(straight-As, high SAT score, etc), but one comes from a poor neighborhood with underfunded schools, and the other comes from a wealthy suburb, they can choose the one from the poor neighborhood.  

Arguments for affirmative action are that it helps level the playing field somewhat -- it's likely the student from an underfunded school may have had to pick up a part time job to support their family, may have had worse teachers, larger class sizes, and food insecurity, or other obstacles while the student in the wealthy suburb likely didn't have to do any of that and may have even had private tutoring and smaller class sizes.

Arguments against it is that it's unfair to white people who have to compete against ""slackers"" in low income areas.  Also it's probably illegal due to a misapplication of the civil rights act.","38_2"

""However, some colleges buck this pattern and have a large share of students from low-income families and relatively good earnings outcomes, resulting in a high mobility rate of students from the bottom to the top of the income distribution. Examples of such high-mobility-rate colleges include mid-tier public institutions such as the City University of New York (CUNY), certain campuses of the California State University system, and several campuses in the University of Texas system."" 

In other words - public schools are good at providing opportunities for upward mobility but these elite institutions like Harvard use affirmative action to appear diverse while in reality cater to the rich.

So few Americans know what far left and socialism even are and conflate it with liberalism. As a socialist, I consider liberalism to be a centrist or center right position.

When I tell conservatives that, it's funny to watch as their brains stall out and they become that confused math lady meme. It's extra funny if I first agree with them that liberals aren't great before revealing it's because liberals are too far to the right.

I still vote Democratic in every election since they are vastly better than the literal christofascists, who are so close to taking over if the republicans win, and every vote is important (I got banned from a socialist subreddit for arguing that point).

I take consolation in the fact that data shows millennials and gen z are not following the typical pattern of moving further right as we get older, which means conservatism is dying.  This is just its last desperate attempt to seize power before most of its base of supporters dies of old age. If we hold them off for a few more years, they will fade into obscurity as the Overton window shifts left to center on where younger generations are.","2_5"

DeSantis does not want to ban gay marriage. Sure, he didn't want to pass a law to protect gay marriage, but his reasoning was that gay marriage was already protected, rather than wanting to ban it.

When he was asked whether he supports LGBTQ+ marriage, many times he refused to answer rather than saying he doesn't support it.

However, he has stated that he wants churches to have the right to refuse same-sex marriage. This is not the same as banning gay marriage.

I'm not saying I support DeSantis nor his policy, but from what I read specifically on the stance of gay marriage, DeSantis is much more accepting to gay marriage than Bill Clinton was during his presidency.

Let's all admit it. Bill and Hillary Clinton made a big mistake when signing the defense of marriage act, and I hope we can all remember. I was there. Parties can change, and we need to encourage acceptance of gay marriage rather than trying to mock those who are already making progress.

He is very vocal about banning lots of stuff, but he won't say he wants to ban gay marriage. If he wanted to ban it, he would proudly proclaim it like all his other bans.

DeSantis didn't say he wants to make being trans illegal. If that were true, DeSantis would want to put Caitlyn Jenner in jail for being trans.

However, most Republicans don't want to provide gender affirming surgery or hormone blockers to underage people. This is different than making being trans illegal.

My best friend from my early 20's ended up transitioning from MTF, and she did so after turning 20. She thought long and hard before doing the transition, and she knew that it wasn't a decision to take lightly.

From what I see, many trans and gay people are openly accepted by Republicans, including Blair White and Jamie Ensley. In fact, Jamie Ensley has long been an LGBT activist, and now holds a political seat in the GOP.

The way I see it is that GOP generally doesn't like to have laws specifically for LGBTQ+ adults, and they don't like compelled speech.

For me, I believe all adults should do whatever they want with their bodies, and it's none of our business, because it's their bodies. We don't have any business telling what people can or cannot do with their bodies.

However, I also agree somewhat with SOME people of the GOP in that we should avoid racial or gender based laws. Every person must be equal under the law, and there must not be any laws that specifically target people by race or gender.

And yes, I am also against laws that target the Native Americans.

I don't believe in affirmative action. I believe that EVEN if the world is not an even playing field, trying to balance it out will cause more harm than good, and will cause us to treat each other differently according to race and gender.","9_1_2_1"

According to an analysis by news-journalonline, it seems the bill would block venues from admitting children to live performances that ""depicts or simulates nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, specific sexual activities, & lewd conduct, or the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts. ""

As you said, the description is vague, but none of the penalties carries a death sentence. From what I see, the choices are that the performance would not be allowed to have an ""all ages of audience"" rating, and that venues can refuse to offer licenses to shows that have these qualities. The worst thing I believe can happen is that the performance will be forced to put an age restriction, or lose their performance license.

I don't agree with this ban. I believe it is up to the parents to decide what their kids should watch, and kids should even be able to access R rated movies or R rated video games if the parents allow.

That being said, I think there is a lot of misinformation about politics. I made a mistake about believing a lie that Democrats were trying to legalize pedophilia, but then it turns out that Republicans were lying about laws from Democrats.","9_1_2_1_1_1_1_1"

I do not know what is the penalty for performing without a license or exposing the public to indecency. I assume DeSantis wants to ban public drag performers, but I do not know if they will be charged with indecency towards a minor.

Like I said, I do not approve of DeSantis or his laws, but death for wearing a skirt seems like overkill for even DeSantis.","9_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

If you want to motivate voters, give them big, clear, \*positive\* things to vote for, e.g. a living wage, universal health care, affordable colleges, police reform, revitalizing cities with mass transit and high speed trains, a green new deal, ending homelessness, etc.

Instead, the ""Left"" (actually the far-right) and the GOP (the far-far-far-right) continue to argue over social wedge issues in public because it's a great distraction from issues that would negatively impact the profits of their corporate donors. And it allows them collude in private with big business to destroy the middle class.



I know. I know. There are countless ""differences"" that people can cite, along examples of real harm done.

Let me pre-concede all of those examples. I'm aware of them. I agree.

Rather, my focus is more forrest for the trees.

I grew up in the 1970s. I've witnessed a once prosperous, comfortable, and accessible middle class decay, crumble, and all but disappear.

College was something Baby Boomers could pay for with a summer job. Now it can result in a lifetime of crippling debt.

Decent homes could be purchased by couples working minimum wage. Yes, really. Now those same homes are several orders of magnitude more expensive and beyond affordability for people making 6 figures.

Homelessness was once extremely rare. Now homeless encampments are everywhere.Healthcare has gone from an accessible, miracle fifth estate of society to become a predatory wealth confiscation scam that consumes nearly 1/5 of our economy. Political corruption is the main cause.

Corporations have outsourced America's once great industrial might (wealth, jobs, infrastructure, tax base) to China and other countries. The US even struggled to produce N95 masks during the pandemic. The dirty secret about illegal immigration is that both parties (Republicans, too) love it, because it allows corporations to in-source cheap labor, so they can avoid paying US workers good wages. If \*either\* party were serious, they would go after the corporations who employee undocumented workers; but those corporations donate generously to their political campaigns, so that's never going to happen.

Network news (however imperfect) was once trustworthy and reliably neutral. Now it's political propaganda and commercial cross-promotions.

Corporations have been allowed not only to merge into gigantic oligarchies and monopolies, but also to exploit their market dominance with almost zero oversight or consequence. That's bad for consumers, it's bad for innovation, it's bad for productivity, and it's bad for capitalism. But crony capitalism is very lucrative for the biggest and wealthiest corporations. Oh, and most of the ""inflation"" we've been experiencing is driven by corporate profiteering. And nobody's doing a thing about it.

Family farming, where it still exists, is becoming a kind of indentured servitude.

Average family savings are dipping into the negative and the last source of net positive equity for American families, the home, is disappearing as corporations gobble up properties en masse.

And so on. And these fundamental, structural, societal problems are rarely if ever discussed in political campaigns.

All of the problems cited in the screenshot could have been safeguarded in legislation. But the Democratic party never bothered to, say, codify Roe. Why? Maybe it was more useful as a political wedge issue? To fix these things going forward, Democrats would need to win. To win, they'll need to offer more than simply not being racist, sexist, religious nuts. 

But even now, in America's darkest hours in generations, Democrats seem more focused on scolding voters for not being motivated by abuse, or scraps. They need to offer big, clear, \*positive\* things to vote for.","11"

Trump's economic policies were piss awful but they didn't kill the economy. Covid did, and all covid *did* was put the slightest amount of pressure on this pathetic house of cards we called a capitalist economy. Sure, Trump pettily dismantling the pandemic response protocols Obama set up after H1N1 contributed to it being as bad as possible but why did that just happen with no pushback from the democrats? People were already being pushed to homelessness, food-insecurity, joblessness, and *have* been, for AGES. Even without a pandemic. ANYTHING of covid's scale would have put us into this hole. To pretend that shit was fine before Trump is either blatant lies or wishful thinking.

The Supreme Court was already in jeopardy, because republicans were attacking it as far back as Obama. The SC was already doomed when the fascists that have been sitting in our government for decades decided it was a threat to their insane agenda. Biden still campaigned on ""working with my republican friends"", so who exactly? McConnell? Cruz? Hatch? Grassley? Those assholes have been sitting on our government way before Trump was. Do you seriously believe they'll just dust their hands and move on from the SC if they'd have lost 2016? Ginsberg passed away and whatshisface retired in that span. Who was going to fill those seats exactly.

&gt;That last one has had lasting effects to this day, from rolling back reproductive rights to jeopardizing civil rights and LGBTQ+ rights.

Since we're talking about that too, why did the democrats *not* take the steps they promised they would to protect those rights and codify them into law? They have had greater majorities than they currently do multiple times since I've started voting and they didn't do shit, because it was more expedient to their party interests to keep things like Roe and Obergefell in peril so they could leverage it for votes. They don't give a flying fuck about Roe. Pelosi was doubling down on supporting Henry Cuellar even after Roe was overturned after she was busted donating fuckloads of money to his campaign.

And obviously the republican party was going to become this eventually. The Tea Party was exactly MAGA just with a shadowy cabal of astroturfing billionaires speaking in dogwhistles instead of just this one jackass worshipping cult. Same talking points, same policies, same bullshit. If Trump didn't exist MTG and Boebert would just be Tea Party libertarians instead of maga republicans. They used the same conspiracies, encouraged the same violence, screamed the same slogans. The organization behind birtherism was absolutely going to go full nazi in due time. They were already being backed by David Duke. All that under Obama, and the DNC's response during and after *that* was just ""stay the course, stay the same old Reagan democrats we've been for the last 30 years. No need to go left to counteract this, no need to actually respond to this"" and the king of reagan democrats was Biden, and that's who was shoved down America's throats by democrat party leadership.

They've done literally nothing while Republicans run roughshod over minorities and expect people to THANK them for it.

They suck. They're not fascists but they enable fascism. There is very little material difference to the people most affected.

Vote for one of the two options you have that lines up closest with your ideology. If you're blessed to be in a state that already implemented ranked choice voting (a very recent development, so change is happening) then vote third party because there it will actually matter.

If you don't have ranked choice voting then voting third party means you gave your vote to one of *many* different third parties that **collectively** received ~1% of the votes in the 2020 election. 

Pure math says that is a vote wasted in just about every sense of the word unless you are somehow able to convince a significant chunk of the population to all vote for a single third party candidate that many states likely won't even have listed on the ballot. A volume of voters to the tune of a roughly 50 fold increase

However, it is important to remember that the Bush v. Gore election was decided by a difference of ~100 voters. You're vote does matter with the caveat that it is for one of the two options we realisticaly have.

Without individuals supporting alternative methods of ballot casting, the system, and those in positions of power for the system, have no incentive to do things differently. ""If it ain't broken don't fix it"" is the mentality, and by voting purely binary because you're so focused on the result and not the meaning and voice behind the vote then all you're doing is enabling bad behavior to never change. Wishing for a different outcome and doing the same thing doesn't work. It takes a true radical in power that also needs support to make the change effective, or a population that grows and demands to be heard, or often breaking the law/violence to make a demonstration.","37_1_1_1_1"

If you're referring to the sentiment you expressed of "" Keep on waiting for things to change and they never will. "" I am confused now as I do not support that statement and even brought up how voting in a specific way will lead to actual change... I even gave rough example numbers near the end expressing the idea that change is very much possible so long as we are going about it in the right way.

To further my point, support for a ranked choice system has been around for a while, well before the 2016 election. It only came up more recently as talking points because it was shown to be an effective system in states that allowed it. Specifically from states with recently elected candidates. Where in said states have been historically stuck under one party for a long time. They had enough voter turn out for the opposite party in recent elections that resulted in said opposition party winning and enacting reforms.

I'll be honest for the second paragraph of your comment, I keep reading it and I'm not sure how to respond because you have a lot of misinformation/misunderstanding of what I said, mixed with putting some words in my mouth (I never once said anything to do with or supporting a if it ain't broke don't fix it mentality. Our system is clearly broken, and we do need to fix it, however I want to do so going the route that will result in actual change). So I'll try to simplify my stance as best I can and we can work from there:

1. Currently we have a binary system that entertains the ideas of third parties, but in actuality are not viable due to a mixture of the mathematics involved in a FPTP system we have, Human psychology, and corruption.
2. I and most people would like to vote third party, however, it is again not a viable solution at this time. So we would like to change the system to a ranked choice system where third parties would be viable.
3. In order to change the system you have to either change it from within by voting for candidates that support the idea, or revolution IE, implement by force. Revolution is not viable for a large amount of reasons
4. This means to change the system we need to vote. As explained third parties do not win under a FPTP system which we are trying to change
5. So we find candidates who are supported by one of the big two that support election reform. We vote for them to enact change. We have seen that voting for certain parties have a higher likely-hood of enacting voter reform that supports third party participation in multiple states now.
6. To summarize: 
   1. Voting third party currently leads to no change and is ineffective. voting for one of the two big party candidates that supports election reform does lead to change. Until FPTP system of voting is replaced with a ranked choice style system, third party votes do not contribute to enacting any meaningful change at all. 
   2. They do not signal anything to the big parties as the hardly notice the difference on a national scale where in **ALL** third party candidates combined received \~1% of the total votes cast (if they were even on the ballot in some states), at a local level, sure they might create an upset from the siphoning effect, but it can still backfire very easily and produce counter-intuitive results and they still don't win enough to have any real influence. 
   3. To create real change we will have to suck it up and vote for the lesser of two evils that promises election reform and then can happily vote third party once implemented. It will be a slow process, it will suck. But it is better than the alternative of not voting/voting third party and thus leading to no reform at all due to no candidate supporting reform being elected in the first place.","37_1_1_1_1_1"

Politics wasn't as loud as it is now and it was very easy to grow up exposed to some ideas and never be forced to challenge them. There are plenty of right wing talking points that sound reasonable to a layman and someone who ""wasn't very into politics"" could have easily gone with one or just a few. ""We're trillions of dollars in debt and the democrats want to spend more money we don't have on X"" sounds very reasonable when you don't know anything about economics, the economic benefit those programs have, or the ways that Republican fiscal policies damage the economy. Frankly those people still exist even if it's becoming harder and harder to be ignorant without doing so willfully. 

Not to mention, challenging your beliefs is hard, and there's a massive right wing propaganda network dedicated to making the right wing seem correct to laymen and making that even harder. If you see a trained right wing talking head discuss issues with say, untrained invited guests chosen to paint their opponents in a bad light, or random college kids and only post the ones who don't know what they're talking about, the right wing talking head is going to look way more educated and reasonable. 

Don't get me wrong, there's an absolutely massive portion, if not a strong majority, of Republican voters who are simply evil in innumerable ways. But there is a significant portion that are mostly just victims of ignorance or propaganda. And yeah, these people do share some responsibility for the evils they have perpetuated in their ignorance, but if these people fundamentally had evil in their heart the right wing propaganda network wouldn't need nearly the scale it has.","3_1_1"

They are pro slavery evidenced by their criminal Justice stance-slavery never ended in America and is till legal for prisoners. 

Child labor-they are pushing for removal of work restrictions to protect children and putting children in dangerous working environments, such as slaughter houses

Anti abortion=anti-freedom 

Pro censorship-good, everyone agrees on this, its just republicans lying and creating fake boogeymen.

Anti-Racism= care to expand on this one? Their policies and stances do not support anti racism

Pro paying back the money borrowed: Lmao like the COVID loan forgiveness? Corporations making off with one of the largest transfers of wealth in history. 

Pro self defense: what does this even mean. 

Pro gay: Ah yes, because the war on pride flags and calling gay people groomers, passing anti LGTBQ legislation, some politicians have called for eradication of trans people from society

Anti-illegal immigrant: oh you sweet summer child this has been used as a outrage porn issue for decades yet republicans do fuck all about it because corporations need cheap undocumented labor

Pro-Putin is the incomprehensible decisions, positions, and stances aligning PERFECTLY with Russia, when our materiel support for Ukraine is literally one of the best Geopolitical ROIs in modern American history. Russia is an enemy of the US, and working hand over fist to divide us (its working), but for some reason, numerous GOP politicians are verbalizing stances that align perfectly with Russian interests.

Its not the most intellectually sound statement, but I think its based on his own biographical expressions about his life. Within the Black community he was subject to ridicule about his looks. He was later openly disrespected by his white peers in his seminary school. He has suggested himself that he wasnt necessarily part of the overall community. His somewhat brief activist awakening in school seemed like the product of envying those who championed the cause. 
This goes into the anti Black assertion. 
Once he was allowed into a school with self admitted affirmative action help his goal became about fitting in even more so than in previous years.
There has always been what can be loosely called social conservatism in Black communities, but its mostly based on religious fundamentals not political. 
Once he found his way into the politcial world through his legal practice, and joined in with a group of Black republicans (always a rare outlier of a thing after the civil rights bill) he admittedly took on a new character. He took on the role of being a foil against the laws overwhelmingly supported by Black voters even if he had been a beneficiary. Saying the hypocritical act of benefitting from affirmative action while also being its biggest opposition afterward, knowing the reason it came to be, is not subjectively anti Black it is definitively anti Black bc Black ppl are the specific voting cohort that are the reason it exists.
I will correct myself and say sure you can disagree, but at what cost? To what end? Serious question... does his short stint being a junior level activist overshadow his actions since he was first hired by Reagan? I for one dont think it does.

Because too often our discussion about important issues is reduced to simple statements like ""he hates being black."" That's a statement that stops all analysis of his actions, motives and reasonings. It dismisses any further discussion on the topic: why discuss someone that hates black people? There's nothing you can do with that.

Since black people are such an influential source of economic and political power, we need to focus on what's real. We can't make informed decisions about things if we don't have a full understanding of them. ""He hates being black"" may not be real. ""He thinks the best way to help black people is to force their self-reliance and let our natural resilience that's kept us going through slavery and racism kick in"" may be a better description of what's happening. Even if in this case the outcome is the same (hurting black people), the reasoning matters.

Why does that matter? Because understanding is power. I guarantee you the people bringing cases before the supreme court have an understanding of the justices, how they rule, their philosophies, etc and they leverage that to their advantage when making arguments before them. I can use ""black nationalist"" to my advantage if I have to argue before him. If I think he's just hell bent on hurting black people, I won't even try.","2_6_4_1_1_1"

I would suggest the next action to be looking into the similar actions of others if he is determined to be anti Black by way of his literal actions and/or rhetoric. We can catalog those behaviors and ideological affiliations.
You posited that maybe he considers his actions from a motive of Black ppl could do better after his actions. Lets look at the reality.
He is a profound example of affirmative action as it was meant to be implemented. He has achieved considerable success with that being a major factor. Confirming to a particular ideology that aligns with discrimination, racism, and overt anti Blackness is another thing he used as well.

The majority of Black men who come from a similar background will not get anywhere near his level of success. So how exactly does lifting the ladder behind you denote the prospect that his way is better for Black ppl. Black ppl are already - responsible, hardworking, and ethical without bad right wing legislation. Cutting provisions that have been made to help divert inequality is not a valid argument for better outcomes for Black ppl. Thats the same logic as saying lets roll back civil rights legislation bc not catering to discriminated ppl in that legal manner will be better for them. 
By his own narrative he directly works against the majority of voting Black ppl regardless of profession or education level. He chose to side with a few self admitted Black elitists when he came to Washington who were no doubt the children of those already wealthy (by his own words.) His method is to align with those who align with white supremacist ideology bc it simply looks like they will always win where status matters. He is by definition anti Black. >#","2_6_4_1_1_1_1"

Yes, because we are failing black and latino students well before college. NCLB was a trainwreck that weaponized the school system against majority minority communities. The ability to be competitive with your peers at 18 is a function of the social support you receive during your childhood and adolescence. We shouldn't be only helping the children who are able to defy the average. We should be helping the children who are denied a functional average before it squanders their natural born opportunity.

Merit systems cannot address systematic inequity by definition. All they do is reassure the public that those that we have trodden on deserve to be under our boots without actually having examined the people we're taught to accept deserve exclusion. When we look at the exception as the model that the disadvantaged should strive for, we set an impossible standard and actually underscore their exclusion.","2_13_1_1"

Relative to what expected outcome? 

If by chance in the near future for whatever reason flagship schools in California are suddenly overrepresented by latinos and blacks should we fix that and force them to have more white and asian kids? 

And make sure that race is always perfectly represented but only at flagship California schools?

And we should do this regardless of how hard someone works but solely on race alone?

Why not every organization and institution?

Should every organization and institution be forced to have a representative mixed of race as race demographics change over time regardless of individual effort and talent?

Or maybe, just maybe, we help those who need it as best and as unbiased as we can based on the resources we have to do it regardless of race or color or other characteristics and when it comes to outcomes we let the chips fall where they may.","2_13_1_1_1_1"

My god, this hurts.

I was one of the ""smart kids"" growing up and made the decision to move in with my father at the age of 11 and again at 13.

Unbeknownst to me, he was an alcoholic and abuser and the first 11 years of my life did a complete 180.

I went from a loving family, mom and grandparents, to living with someone who divorced my mom when I was 2.

I went through 6 years of abuse at the hands of that man and went from being a kid who loved school, had goals and friends to someone who isolated themselves in the library or in extra curriculars because they didn't want to go home.

By the time I was 18, I escaped and went back to my mom's and grandparents, but it's been a daily grind to fight that trauma.

What points do you think he is making when he references post-segregation schools experiencing decline, especially in the context of his previous statements and actions around this and other similar issues? 

He makes it clear that he thinks minority students are better suited to their local ""racially isolated"" schools and would like to get rid of affirmative action to stem the flow of students who would damage schools and colleges just for the sake of diversity, despite the fact that there is still ongoing prejudice to be combatted and the fact that he himself gained from it before doing a backflip on his views, like he so often nonsensically does on serious matters.

Jackson with the real talk. 

Clarence remains in his ivory tower with statements like these in his concurring opinionthat nobody joined: What matters is not the barriers they face, but how they choose to confront them. And their race is not to blame for everything  good or bad  that happens in their lives. Oh fuck right off.

The barriers they face dont matter? That statement is literally nonsense. Of course the barriers matter. Some are a lot harder to overcome than others, e.g., systemic racism. Nobody is saying race is to blame for everything either. What kind of piece of shit Justice uses strawmen like this?

Most of their all-black schools were closed and their black teachers were not hired at the desegregated schools. So a lot of the needs that were met in the all-black schools with black teachers were now going unaddressed.

Desegregation also led to a lot of white flight out of cities and from the public school systems to private schools, thus leaving public schools drained of revenue and impacting the resources to keep pace with still majority white private schools that excluded black students for various reasons.

As you noted, theres a very limited number of schools that create the pipeline to clerkships, one of the five which is the exact school that is now prohibited from considering race, which reinstitutes the exact gatekeeping to elite positions to those with privilege, particularly white privilege. 

Thomas, with his HCBUs do such a great job paternalism while reinforcing that exact gatekeeing is, in practice, contradicting his entire point and you literally reinforced that contradiction and didnt even realize you did.

2. Highest percentage of people in prison than even during Stalins Great Purge.

No, I am not arguing for the SCOTUS to become tyrannical. I am saying that they are acting that way now and should have all their rulings ignored if they are going to keep taking advantage of their positions, bend the law they are supposed to uphold, and interpret the constitution in a way that does not benefit the people, but their wealthy doners and Republicans.

As an aside but a hobby horse of mine--Something that I fully support

We wrongfully convict far too many people, to date there are 190 people that were sentenced to death that were fully exonerated of their crime that put them on death row and likely far more that have already been wrongly put to death or currently sitting on death row for crimes they did not commit--- until that number is 0 I can't support capital punishment 

I fully realize that cases like this, where there is absolutely 0 question whether this asshole is guilty or not that sentiment rings a bit hollow, but when a law is on the books it applies to everyone.

I am a non-binary person who always makes sure to gender people correctly, even when they've committed a crime, but I, personally, will not be referring to this person as nonbinary until there is definitive evidence that this person claimed to be nonbinary before this incident, which, so far, evidence points to the exact opposite. It feels wrong.

I personally feel that believing that this person is nonbinary just because their defense attorney said so has potential to be harmful and, there is a very, very big difference between an LGBT+ person doing this and a cis straight white man doing this. Both are guilty, naturally, and both are capable of hate, but I think it's wrong to ignore that, given that this person is likely not nonbinary, this is absolutely a politically motivated move that's also being used to try to get out of hate crime charges. If we don't address the fact that this personally is, with 99.9% certainty lying about the gender identity that this person uses, it will only get worse from here-on out. 

Right-wingers are already using this to call queer people dangerous, crazy, rapists and accusing us of victimizing ourselves. This lie emboldens them and it's going to set a precedent for future violent offenders if we blindly believe it and treat this person, who has only shown evidence that they are not queer, as if this person is part of the community that this person actively committed a violent hate crime against due to the rise of cis, straight, white terrorism. The lie this defense attorney has made feels very gross and even violating, as if they are trying to force their way into something they shouldn't be in, trying to claim that this person is the same as me when this person clearly is not, trying to use the dysphoria that I feel as a tool for deceit.

I'm tired of the violence. And I'm tired of the political moves these people make to hurt the LGBT+ community. And it particularly hurts when other people don't seem to really care when lies are being told and act like it doesn't matter what they say. I know your post is literally you explaining that you do care and how it hurts the community and, I'm not intending to attack you when I say this, it feels very insincere when someone does say things that seem to understand only to turn around and do exactly what the violent offender wants people to do. It spreads the idea around that they are non-binary and I feel that does a disservice to the community and indirectly, accidentally, spreads more anti-LGBT+ sentiment.

I am not going to go around on this post to yell at anyone referring to this person as ""they/them"" or potentially nonbinary, the comment correcting someone else as if it is a given got to me in a way that I can't fully explain. Again, the best I can describe it as is as if something integral to my being has been violated, my sense of justice is confused, because I feel that it's so clearly a lie, but others do not think the same.

I'm sorry for the long post. I have a lot of feelings about this. It feels especially targeted against my minority group since non-binary people (as you probably know) are so often accused of being crazy even by other trans people. It feels like non-binary was picked for a particular reason by a malicious attorney.","5_2_1_1_1"

This subreddit will not allow people to deflect from the fact that the extreme-right stochastic terrorism is resposible for the rise in violence against LGBTQ+ people.

I do, however, think the context does matter. If this truly had been a case of a nonbinary person feeling abused by the LGBT+ community, the conversation would be much different, and that's also partially why his attorney claimed this. The conversation has already been irreversibly changed to be about the potential impacts of a non-existent ""gay on gay"" violence epidemic. It's already be shifted over from ""this man murdered people in an act of hate"" to ""but *if* this *was* an LGBT+ person..."" And the reason for that is because it is different and it does matter.

I don't mean to bring Nazi's into this, but it's the closest example I can think of right now and they are often related to this shooters in some way and there is a rise in anti-Semitism on top of the rise of LGBT+ hate crimes. So, I'm going to use it. It would be like saying it doesn't matter if it was a Neo-Nazi or a Jew committing a synagogue shooting. There is obviously a very big difference and ignoring that difference feels almost disrespectful and dismissive of the discrimination and danger that Jews face. I think that's something we could probably agree on. But that's exactly what it feels like right now, with this situation.

And, I know you do not intend to hurt anyone with this. It's coming from a very good place in your heart. You are doing amazing and spreading information and an overall good message. It just feels like what's being said by those echoing this opinion that ""gay people suffer so much and right wing terrorists are doing this and this and pretending to be queer to hurt the image of queer people"" is somewhat insincere or ignorant because then people are turning around and saying ""but actually it doesn't matter what their identity is even though identity is a crucial component in right wing terrorism.""

I don't know if you are LGBT+ or not, but I know I am, and I'm just presenting my view of the situation. It's hurtful to know that others would blindly listen to the things a terrorist or their attorney says even when it's so obvious that they are lying. It feels uncomfortable to think that people would so willingly allow a person who committed an act of terrorism against us into our community when all the evidence points to them lying and being a hateful bigot. That people would say things like ""the person's identity doesn't matter"" when it's over a hate crime against LGBT+ people of all things. 

It's a hard feeling to explain, honestly. It feels almost surreal, in a way, but I can't figure out why. And perhaps we're having a miscommunication, I'm not sure. All I know for sure is that what happened is painful for everyone in the community in different and yet similar ways.","5_2_1_1_1_1_1"

The only reason to mention such an inconsequential aspect of the shooter is to pull attention away from the fact that this and EVERY massacre is co-signed by the fascist hate-group that is the republican party.

Forget for a second that either of the USs major political parties exist. Now, if there existed a hypothetical party that Wanted the US to be a nation where massacres are the norm, and people are consumed by fear and/or hatred, what type of policies would they implement and obstruct? Well, the same exact ones the republicans implement and obstruct now.

It doesnt take any mental gymnastics to conclude that a group that wants this type of thing to happen would do exactly what the republicans do now.

The announcement from defense lawyers that the shooter identifies as nonbinary feels very similar to many alt-right 4chan-style psy-ops. It's the perfect way to add insult to injury: 1. murder people of a certain group in a senseless hate crime 2. claim after the fact to be a member of that group, so now it's actually the attacked group's fault in many peoples' minds. The sanity and rationality of said group is now questioned by mainstream sources. ""Did this person commit this crime because they're another crazy, violent, mentally unstable transgender??"" becomes the discourse and the right-wing figures who *actually* caused this get away with everything.

To say they're making it up or should prove it is irrelevant, their identity has no impact on this. Publicly.. yes it does, i get that, the whole jilted lover or ""this particular club"" thing could easily be a defence their attorney is planning to use. 

But i feel this is just another chance for some people to kinda goof on people coming out as nonbinary for some personal gain or attention, which is definitely a notion used in real life against normal non-terrorist Nb people. If they're super repressed and only realized it after killing five people, great, good for them, have fun in the fucking slammer lol. If some gay guy kills another gay guy because he's repressed and dealt with it through murder, its still a goddamn hate crime, you don't get special treatment cuz you figured it out too late. 

I completely agree with the notion this was just said by the shooter to further mock queer people, or by the defence as a getoutofjailfree card, (im not completely stupid, that's clearly what's going on) but on the off chance that it's not i dont see the point in ""debunking"" the claim. If it is a legal distraction, then focusing on it is only doing what the defence wants. God forbid we just fully acknowledge their identity (regardless of the claims validity) and still have the awareness to never let them see the light of day. That to me sounds like the exact opposite of what the defence wants and expects, so I'm all for it. 

Im queer myself so i swear there's no ill will in saying any of this, i don't actually think acknowledging that they could have gender issues does any disservice to Nb people at all, *as long as a hate crime is still charged as a hate crime*. Think about what it would actually say about nonbinary people if that defence works. That they're all emotional and repressed and could snap at any minute on their own people, and therefore deserve to have a more lenient sentence because they're not fully in control of themselves. gross. Reminds me of the ""gay panic"" defence that actually got queerphobic killers more lenient sentences. 

Hate corrupts no matter your identity, if the claim is true this is only more proof of that. I really want a follow up interview with their dad now. oh you're *so* glad your son's not gay? sorry loser, they're genderqueer now. and got life in prison. wallow.","26"

He had a meek little wife and a couple kids. 

Few years after we got the heck out of there learned that Joe had resigned. My then college sophomore daughter when we told her sighed and said So did he come out gay?  Why would you ask that? She detailed his homophobic comments and going out of his way to declare his affinity for women.

I think the shooter calling himself an nb is total bullshit. It's either a way to avoid being charged with a hate crime or one last effort to throw another punch at the LGBTQ+, by manipulating the narrative entirely. Now right wing media is gonna use this to continue smudging us and fuel more of these violent attacks.  

Think about it 

The abusive, meth addicted father, was adamant about teaching his son how ""gay is bad"". The father's sigh of relief when he though his son went to a gay bar ""because he's gay""

The father taught him that acts of violence gets people what they want.

Father and Grandfather were extreme right.

Shooter had an instagram profile with one pic of a pride flag burning. Then goes and shoots up a gay bar. Gets caught and says he's ""non-binary"". This is pretty much the equivalent of murderers pleading insanity.","53"

Ive noticed that both sides regardless of political affiliation has become increasingly quick to be first to a story to shape it, instead of letting the entire details of a story unfold. 

No one can claim this is not an atrocity and heinous act. But when we allow ourselves to jump quickly into intensely demonizing rhetoric, instead of disregarding said rhetoric and understanding there is way more information at play, we shape a story into a specific politically focused narrative that often leaves new information and details buried later on by yet another intensely focused story. 

Why as a nation have we become so hellbent on lifting the opinions of a few, when they often times do not speak for the 300 someodd million citizens and counting?

He got in and shot. Now, if you believe childs are in there and you love childs, you wont shoot. If you believe a crime is taking place you bring a camera and later have them arrested. If you believe someone is in danger you call 911 because its both weapons on your side and ambulance for your friends. If you believe something is wrong you can ask congress to pass a law. If you believe you absolutely gonna shoot some baddies, you probably chose a weapon that does no colateral damage, shoot only in case you need, and shoot when the baddies are not in between other people. As the baddies deserve a trial and we deserve to be sure who is the bad guy before deciding if the person shall live, be free, be in jail, or executed.

So, all of the above considered, there was a shooter and an entire party shut up about it, while some more active people actually took the defense of the shooter. Some media are covering or supporting the shooter. 

You are asking to step back and see the facts. Done. The facts are a person did murder people despite having a dozen better options, we have a lot of people clapping or at lest ignoring the crime. If you took a step back, and what you saw was both sides are a bit silly, you need help bro. You really really need help.

Because the more I step back the more I see the full picture, a pretty darn clear one.","93_2"

The stance that I take is to have patience and fortitude so we can actually have firm action/legislation built on what was obviously wrong. 

The dude came from a white Republican family that, because of political connections, allowed this guy to walk away scot free a year ago after a federal crime was committed (bomb threat). I just hope we can actually have some concessions across the aisles that will make a difference, and not kick and scream at each other to the point that nothing tangible happens.","93_2_1"

If you were to walk around in almost any state and ask viewpoints, regardless of what political affiliation, the grand majority would be accepting of most walks of life.

We have a beautiful country with a beautiful mashup of ethnicities and religions, unfortunately controlled by a caucus of wishywashy whatever keeps me in office career politicians that are out of touch with the general population.

In similar concept, Google once had an issue raised due to the low amount of women hired for highly technical jobs. What they showed was that, compared with the graduate programs within the schools they hired from, they were actually hiring women at a much higher than statistically likely rate. The primary issue was that there were fewer applicants to graduate schools in the first place by women, which was caused by lack of representation in the career, parental expectations, societal expectations, etc...

This is also in no small part because they did comic book villain stuff like having the army machine-gun striking mine workers (Rockefeller and the Ludlow Mine Massacre), organizing violent attacks against workers trying to unionize (Ford), and hiring private military contractors to kill striking workers (Carnegie and the Homstead Strike).

First off, the premise of a test to measure intelligence has come under constant scrutiny and as of yet IQ tests, at least, have not achieved validity when it comes to scientific measurement. IQ tests have been shown to be culturally biased, misapplied, inconsistent when tests are repeated with the same people, and generally a bad method of gauging the mental capabilities and possibilities of a person.

Second, were such data even collectable and not invalidated, there exist numerous other interpretations which more adequately explain the data with more supporting data and fewer assumptions than the biological-essentialism suggested there.

And third, the premise that someone's skin color or 'race' could have these kind of essential genetic influences had been very adequately debunked. 'Race is a social construct' isn't a catchphrase, it's a description about how race simply does not exist the way people believe, and it ultimately boils down to a handful of phenotypical features shared amongst groups of people which we then apply all sorts of social presumptions to that have little to no bearing on a person's actual abilities or inherent traits. 

Indeed, the phenotypical trait we assign some of the harshest and heaviest baggage to, skin color, is only so heavily weighted in how we judge people because of its observability. Other than being visible, there has been no significan link between skin color and genetic makeup. Even previously held beliefs like ""Black people are genetically predisposed to have high blood pressure"" have been debunked.","12"

For those who dont know the history as well as you and I: Francis Galton (British) coined the term eugenics, but he was dead by 1911.

seriously though, I can think of some families in which you can trace a multigenerational tradition of talent, but I'm inclined to ascribe that somewhat to early childhood experience and learning -- if you grow up in the family of a renowned classical composer and are taught to play at a very early age, you're more likely to excel in music than in, say, woodworking.

Also, these asshats tend to ignore the degree to which people today carry all kinds of wild DNA mashups from our warlike, commercial, and roving past.  So claiming that somehow ""intelligence"" or ""IQ"" runs true to ""racial"" (a fictional construct) genotypes, is claiming that those genotypes are pure and unmixed which is more BS.

And let's not even get started on what SAT scores actually measure -- what abilities are tested and quantified by the SATs -- and whether SAT scores or IQ tests actually reveal some objective quality called ""intelligence,"" or just cultural competence.

Jared Diamond would like a word:

""My perspective on this controversy comes from 33 years of working with New Guineans in their own intact societies. From the very beginning of my work with New Guineans, they impressed me as being on the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people around them than the average European or American is. At some tasks that one might reasonably suppose to reflect aspects of brain function, such as the ability to form a mental map of unfamiliar surroundings, they appear considerably more adept than Westerners. Of course, New Guineans tend to perform poorly at tasks that Westerners have been trained to perform since childhood and that New Guineans have not.""

Blacks have an average lower IQ in the US because of socio economic factors. If we look at a map of the average IQ by country, we see a strong correlation between the IQ and the PIB per capita.

There are also studies showing that when people from poor countries migrate to richer countries, their IQ increases with each generation and (almost) catch up with the locals. If it was purely genetics, African Americans would have an average IQ between 60 and 70 but that's not the case.","70"

Another kid was rather naive and child-like, having triple nationalities and African/Carribean bloodlines.

The SCOTUS cannot physically make a ruling on a topic unless it is BROUGHT UP TO THE SCOTUS IN THE FIRST PLACE. The only reason the conservative SCOTUS was able to even speak on AA is because the case made it up there. THERE IS NO LEGACY RELATED DISCOURSE EVEN CLOSE TO REACHING SCOTUS. Legacy was not mentioned ONCE in this harvard AA case and if SCOTUS wants to act on legacy there has to be legislation first and then it has to be BROUGHT UP to SCOTUS.

AA has been to SCOTUS before and it has always been very very prevalent discourse, unlike legacy. i am 100% for banning legacy and money cases. but this argument is BAD AND FOOLISH. PLEASE STOP.","9"

Now in terms of other interventions, I think high school graduation, family planning and marriage are the secret sauce, whatever you can do to increase those things. Whenever you have those three ingredients in America, you see upward mobility and very low rates of poverty. If you look at any successful immigrant group you will find these ingredients as well.

Your other ""choice"" is usually a slightly less underfunded school in a similar part of town because you still have to get the kid safely to and from school. A lot of people don't own cars, since they're expensive. Plus the issues with single parent homes and the time cost of building a community that can watch your child. 

A good solution is going to be multi-faceted and involve changes at all levels. Maybe incentivize top tier schools investing in elementary education to even that playing field, make it so that there's more options to get students academic help, make athletic scholarships not feel like the only way up....

1. At a disproportionately low rate. The point isn't that 'legacy admissions don't exist for black people', it's that legacy admissions calcify existing power structures. When black people make up 13% of the US population but only 6% of Harvard studentbody, then there are groups explicitly benefiting from legacy admissions as their expense.
2. The black people who are NOT legacy admissions are shit out of luck of opportunities that might set them up for more success. Again, legacy admissions calcify existing power structures, so then you have the exact same families benefitting over and over.

So, I guess, congratulations on missing every point of why people are upset about this

Also...

&gt; Many colleges already dont consider race during admissions

Second, it doesnt account for people with disabilities and health issues.

Third, it doesnt actually even the playing field. The reason why some people do better on the SATs than others is that it doesnt test smarts or knowledge. It tests your ability to take the SATs. Someone who has had extensive prep for the test has an advantage. The people who get that extra prep tend to have wealthy, college-educated parents and go to good schools. And unfortunately because of hundreds of years of racist policies, people of color have been shut out of the neighborhoods with those good schools and have been unable to amass much generational wealth. So you dont do well on the SATs because your parents didnt have the resources to do well on their SATs and go to college because your grandparents didnt have the resources and so on.

However, it doesnt apply to everyone equally.

And people with *physical* disabilities that prevent them from exercising regularly probably experience higher rates of depression and anxiety both because of that difficulty and also because of various societal stigmas associated with disabilities.

Republicans are making things up and holding committee hearings and investigations. At least Democrats would have legitimate standing to have investigated such things. This is an oversimplified version of the shortcomings and faults within the Democratic party, but I'm sure we are likely on the same page.
I hope you are right, but I'm afraid that I'm more likely to be in this case.","6_1_1"

BTW, from a policy standpoint, the way that affirmative action is practiced is not to rectify historical discrimination. It is to do race and sex balancing of classes. Asians have been way more discriminated than Whites in US history, and women have been more discriminated than men in US history, yet at most colleges affirmative action benefits Whites over Asians and men over women. Colleges do this in order to prevent their classes from being disproportionately female or Asian.","5_1_1"
