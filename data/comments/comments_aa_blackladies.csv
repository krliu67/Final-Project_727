Universities understand that to grow an educational institution you need diversity. You need people with different backgrounds to enrich the diversity of overall knowledge. They arent going to accept the same Asians 1000 times over with the same backgrounds (most likely higher socioeconomic status with parents who sent them to private schools and got 5.0s) if the goal is to gather diverse experiences and perspectives. Asians apply to the same universities as other Asians; theyre literally competing against people of the same background.

In high school she cared more about getting close to the popular kids. She was cool and her grades were okay, but she was passive aggressive towards me.
Shes the same girl that told me my family was poor because we eat frozen dinners and frozen foods. =. Honestly idk why this chick was ever my friend, but sometimes you gotta keep your enemies close because You never know who knows who. Now a days everything is about who you know.","13"

Advocating for homosexuality to be punishable by death. Countless times on many of the popular black blogs, BW have celebrated certain countries making homosexuality illegal(with the punishment being death). They've openly admitted to being happy that it was happening, and wishing that America would do the same thing. (meaning they'd be willing to vote for it). 



2. Extreme featurism, colorism, and transphobia. Countless times have BW including **darker** skinned black women accused a black women they didn't like of being ""a man"" (transgender). Whenever someone commits a crime and they have any kind of masculine traits, they push them to the trans community. (I don't have to explain how harmful that is). 



3. Supporting males that commit violence against the LGBT. When I was scrolling through YouTube one day, I came across this videos of members of the LGBT being attacked by a group of black men. I won't go into detail because what happened was disgusting. Made the mistake of reading the comment. Black women defending this behavior saying ""no one has to agree with what they do."" ""They must've said something to deserve that."" This isn't the first time this has happened, this is just an example.



4. Conspiracy theories. This is another bit of transphobia. If you've ever been down the illuminati rabbit hole, you'd know that a BW pushed the agenda that Megan thee stallion is transgender and her real name is (Marcus). They came to this conclusion, by putting her picture up side by side with a dude who looked like her. That lead people to say that she deserved to get shot, because Tory lanez found out she was a man. 



5. Calling every abusive black man gay. Everytime a man does something remotely wrong to women, they push the idea that there's no way this man is straight. (Ex. Zesty, sassy, DL).



6. Supporting people like Boosie. Boosie had his own children molested because he didn't want them to be gay, said disgusting things about Lil nas x, talking about D-wades daughters private area, and probably so much more that I don't know about. For the first part a lot of black women said it was perfectly fine and that people shouldn't worry about what he does with his kids.



7. Allowing fathers to beat the gay out of their sons. 


8. Their insecurities with their own feminity. A lot of black women are so insecure with their own feminity, that they will support hatred against men or transgender people who are feminine, because they believe it's taking something from them.","1_1_6_1_1_1_1_1"

Republicans have convinced white evangelicals that all of their problems are caused by the others, that is, anyone who is not white, Christian, and heterosexual in America. The reality is that people who are in the same socio-economic class, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, have more in common with each other than not. 

Republican politicians focus on driving the message that keeps critical thinking off the table and out of schools. They focus on separating people, highlighting everything that is different, and raising it as a way to drive a wedge between people who really have the same needs and wants for their lives, at the most basic levels. 

Since economics is not taught in elementary, jr.. high, or high school, there is a very large cohort of Americans who never learn this lesson. We dont discuss the concept of opportunity costs (butter v. guns), we dont teach sex education (what is required if you want to have sex and avoid pregnancy and STIs), we dont talk honestly about the facts of American history (Reconstruction, Jim Crow, 1900 to 1960s - why The Great Migration happened and more). It is easier to make people behave like lemmings and not think for themselves if they remain uneducated. And this leads to all of the book bans across the country.

Personally, I am passionate about reading. I cannot imagine my life without Judy Blumes books. She is singlehandedly responsible for me knowing about puberty through Are You There God? Its Me Margaret. No one in my family prepared me for anything and it is absolutely shameful. I know that there are thousands of young girls across the country now, in the same situation, not know what is happening to them or why. My heart breaks for girls who live in states where there are no Judy Blume books on the library shelves and no books on human sexuality to read.","3_2"

Its a myth that Canada has free healthcare, what we have is an entirely PUBLIC health care. Health care system is free here if you pay for it to be free. Its free for asylum seekers and immigrants from developing countries with no money because us citizens have to pay a shit ton of tax for others to have those benefits. Canadians pay more taxes than Americans therefore we have more amenities, so it seems free but trust we paying. Basic health care like staying in the hospital is free&using your taxes, and then medication, ambulance, doctor visits are not covered by the government you need to have insurance or youre paying it out of pocket.

Maybe if youre white here then the healthcare is good but in my experience the individuals working in the system are not smart when it comes to black patients. My dad got diabetes because his doctor did not bother to tell him that he saw in his blood tests that he was pre diabetic and he ignored those tests and my dad was diabetic for 3 months without being aware. 

I was having stomach problems and the doctor told me on several different occasions that I have celiac disease, low iron, lactose intolerance, IBS, without doubt any tests and she made me take medication for all of those conditions when I have none of those. 

My sister has sickle cell and was kept in the hospital for 3 weeks because the doctors didnt know what was going on and they presumed it was pneumonia and it was just her hand hurting from a blood clot&.

So yeah just somethings to note if youre moving to Canada for better healthcare","4_1_1_4_1"

I once had toilet paper suck to the bottom of my shoe and the ONLY person to finally point it out to me as I walked allllllll around the convenience store was a black woman who gracefully motioned to my foot. 

On a similar note,
I found a nice and quite public restroom at CVS, and since Ive been coming in regularly (its bliss, restrooms are always open and no one else), Ive noticed that someone put a hand pump soap on the sink even though there is a wall mounted soap....

The first time I went to that salon, my current hairstylist was an intern. She shadowed the woman who did my hair, although we didn't really interact. The next time I had an appointment there, like 4-5 months later, my first hairstylist had left &amp; I got my current hairstylist instead. She remembered everything I had told the first woman, everything. I was so blown away. She had no reason to remember me, I didn't even schedule a second appointment before I left. Shit I struggled to get a hairstylist I went to high school with to even remember my name the second time I went to him. So it's partially that she's kind &amp; partially that she really cares about her profession.

She has been my hairstylist for 4 or 5 years now &amp; I owe her so much for helping me to restore my confidence in my hair. I sent her a card with $100 for Christmas because I felt bad about being too swamped at work during the holiday season to make an appointment.

After I turned 7 my birth mom moved to Cali with my little sister. 

When I was 9 my mom/great-grandma died suddenly and I was alone with her. A couple years later I was sent to live with my birth mom after she'd had another baby. Shortly therearfter, she decided she wanted to move back to the home state.

We moved back via Greyhound. It's crazy to think now about the fact that 4 people moved across the country with all of their belongings in a cardboard box. Anyway, on the bus my mom sat with the baby and my younger sister and since I was older I had to sit beside a stranger for the three-day journey. 

One evening in the middle of the trip an older woman showed up and sat beside me. I don't remember talking to her until nighttime but I felt really comfortable with her which was not usually the case with new people. It got late and I remember falling asleep with my head on her arm and feeling content in a way I hadn't felt since my mom/great-grandma was alive.

 We actually used to take trips via the bus out to Cali to visit an uncle and his kids, so it was very reminiscent of that. She--the stranger--actually looked and dressed like my mom/great-grandma down to the cat-eye glasses. I don't know if any of y'all remember those polyester pants suits that were popular in the seventies/eighties but she had one of those on also. It was uncanny.

When I woke up she was gone. I asked my birth mom if she'd seen her and noticed the resemblance, she said she didn't see her. It was uncanny.

Whoever she was, I am grateful for her kindness and her presence. It felt like I got another chance to spend time with my mom/great-grandma and as a result, was able to gain closure. It brings me peace whenever I think of that experience.","24"

First, when I was a preteen, a woman saw me trying to brush my hair in a change room and offered me her wide-tooth comb to keep instead. She saw what I had wasn't made for my curls!

Second, a wonderful group of women I'd just met welcomed me to join their band for Carribana and showed me the ropes. Had an absolute blast because of them and how welcoming they were. 

Third, I was part of a wedding party and quickly realized the assigned hair dresser did NOT know what do do with my hair. I was so embarrassed and had to leave the salon to find a Black hairdresser nearby and she saved me and made me look beautiful for the event.

That was two years ago, and until last March, I would go into the cafeteria and she wouldn't take my meal card if it was just her at the desk. She would just let me through for free, and would sneak me whatever extra fruits or snacks from the dining floor. Then another lunch lady started talking to me, and after that, she would give me extra servings of the good food or let me have the fresh baked dessert first before she put it out.  I did a favor for her once, and she always told everyone around her about the time I helped her, I thought it was no big deal but it clearly meant a lot to her.

One food stand lady asked me about my family because I looked familiar to her, and from that conversation, I found out she was a second or third cousin of my grandfather.

And yes, in many scenarios there are instances where you can get the a HBCU at the same cost or cheaper than a PWI. 

But there is still a reality that even with this, sometimes PWIs can still be cheaper. I wanted to go to an HBCU for awhiile but went to a top PWI bc I had a full ride since my parents made under a certain amount and we were broke. I felt stuck in that choice. That was me and several people I was in school with and many other PWIs have a higher number of scholarships and grants to give out. And many athletes are in a conundrum bc they have to go to the right program and many of HBCUs have teams that are here today and gone tomorrow. I wanted to go to one and the year I reached out about recruitment, they didnt respond and I realized it was bc they had no team that year. And that terrified me. 

Theres unfortunately a lot of constraints of why people pick the schools they do but youre right, it should be encouraged more for those who it suits. Too many of us think our own schools arent good enough which is not the truth and very self-hating. So I critique more this and other self-hating reasons why ppl dont go to an HBCU rather than the decision in and of itself bc we dont know why someone went to a PWI. PWI doesnt always mean anti-HBCU and I just say this too as someone who is always assumed to be anti-HBCU in HBCU v.

sidenote: its also interesting too bc we value the connections that PWIs have which is true.

It was tax breaks/credits if you had an ""affirmative action"" plan and all you had to do was ""prove"" you recruited x amount of minority to get those tax breaks, ie jobs hiring from within but advertising they are hiring just to interview a bunch of BIPOC people who never had a chance, so they can say they fullfilled their targeted recruitment. But then you have people (like me) who never take the time to research anything themselves, so people assume due to the media that affirmative action was ""forcing"" people to be hired and had to meet ""quotas"" when in actuality it was a workaround for money- like most things.","24"

I believe that this wont drastically change anything as long as the university doesnt quit the initiatives they already said theyre committed too.

Ive heard individuals say that a valedictorian from a poor black school is worth less than one from a wealthy school because of ""grade inflation"" and other bullshit excuses. Im hope that is not the case because we have finally seen increases in diversity in tech and black women especially are being exceptional in the field. When I was in high school I went to a SAT prep class for underprivileged youth because a big hurdle for black high schoolers is having test scores that are competitive with privileged groups that have had their kids in prep courses since 7th grade. This isnt only about class because many working class Asian families prioritized college prep classes and test scores.

White working class boys may do poorly in school, but most will get work after they leave school, while 50% of young Black men of working age, including graduates, are unemployed and continue to have fewer job and advancement opportunities.

A white w/c boy who does poorly at school still has way more chance of getting an apprenticeship and future employment in traditionally working class professions. 

There aren't many Black people working in construction and associated industries, car manufacturing, the coal and steel industries, etc, hell, even your local cake factory will be 99% white. 

Working class white boys are overrepresented in all the manual trades and service &amp; hospitality industries. A poor academic record doesn't necessarily result in poorer life outcomes for them. 

That report made out like they were victims of BAME success, when that's not the case. That report tl:dr was basically ""white boys are suffering because Black and ME people are too good at what they do."" I doubt one has anything to do with the other. 

And quite frankly, if w/c white boys aren't doing as well in school as w/c BAME pupils, you have to look at why schools &amp; teachers are apparently neglecting them in favour of BAME pupils, and you have to look at the parent(s) and what expectations they have for their sons.

1. On the one hand, Brown v. Board of Education was almost 70 years ago. Did we really still need affirmative action to desegregate schools?
2. As someone who was accepted into multiple university and has multiple degrees with Latin honors, did I only make it this far because of affirmative action and not my own intelligence?

I also had another realization when chatting with a friend. I worked in higher ed for a decade and I saw how there were students who just didn't do well. And the focus wasn't telling students to cut their losses and pursue other opportunities/ come back to college when they're ready. The focus was retaining students. Meaning students who didn't have scholarships (or lost their scholarships because they weren't able to handle the academic rigor) were just taking out tons and tons of loans, even if they weren't doing well at college and even if it would have taken them years to graduate. This to me is disingenuous for universities to do because this is actively exacerbating the wealth gap. We are taking young people and saddling them with debt and most of those people are black.   


I think we're going to start to see more of a economic shift that could be positive. The trades are dying right now because tradesmen are getting older and so many students just go straight to college instead of to apprenticeships. Because there are so many vacancies in the trades, the old boys club is becoming less and less diluted and more women and non white people are apprenticing. If black students aren't getting into college because of affirmative action, they could still enter the trades and make six figure salaries without crippling debt. After they save the salaries, if they want to go to college, they probably could put themselves through with little to no debt. I'm hoping this is a net positive for people and maybe it's a better way to uplift other communities.  


Just my very long two cents. Thank you for posting this.","58"

Do you think the white kid who got in because their dad was frat brothers with the dean of admissions  is thinking this?

Do you think the kid whose parents were able to spare thousands of dollars for private tutoring says "" did I get in because my parents had the means to support furthering my education or did I get in because of my own intelligence""?.

You have to be an exceptional student to even get past the threshold for these schools. You wouldn't have gotten multiple degrees with honors because of AA. Why are you underestimating yourself?

And sure the debt issue is bad all around, but is simply not going to school the solution to that? The issue surrounding that is much more complex than simply ""don't go to collge"".  [X](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-racial-wealth-gap-financial-aid-and-college-access/) 

And yes the trades are valid jobs and should be encouraged as well, but the ""6 figure salary"" promise is overplayed. Most tradespeople are not going to be making that much. Lifetime earnings for trade jobs is also significantly lower. Not to mention, depending on the type of work, job security is lower, more contract work is involved (which means not required to pay health benefits) also the physical toll that trades work has on people is significant.  A healthy community would have a healthy balance of people in all types of jobs, not just trades. There also needs to be black teachers, politicians, doctors, scientists, urban planners,  policymakers, historians, engineers, etc. Don't underestimate the importance of college education in terms of social mobility in general. This isn't an either-or-situation.","58_1"

But at the same time, if someone is putting themselves in tens of thousands of dollars of debt, delaying their earnings by more than four years (because the average student graduates in 6 years), they are hurting themselves in the long run. Your Brookings institute article pretty much argues that Black families have fewer assets that are not counted (retirement accounts, home equity) when calculating financial aid awards compared to white families. That has nothing to do with whether or not college is a good investment. If anything, it just highlights that accumulating more debt when you have fewer assets is not going to lead to equal opportunities--it could put you further behind.  


Re: trades. I agree that the starting pay for the apprenticeship level of trades is low. But you can start off with that at a very young age and start earning at 19. For the sake of argument, I'll start the apprentice off at $45,000. Someone who goes to college right out of high school, meanwhile, has already taken on $20,000 of debt in one year with no way to pay it back. By the time the college student has finished at 22 (assuming that they can finish at 22), they are $80,000 in debt. The apprentice has earned $180,000 in gross income and has started to either accumulate money in a retirement account or started paying into a pension plan. And even if the apprentice had taken on loans during those 4 years, at least he can discharge his loans in bankruptcy, but the college student couldn't.  


Finally, I absolutely agree that there are specialized careers that require a college degree, but there are so many more that don't. I think unless you are going into a specialized field that requires a degree (like all of the ones you listed), you should go to college. But so many 18 year olds don't know what they want to do, or they want to do something that doesn't actually require a degree, or they just go to college because ""it's the next step."" Those students, in my view, should probably wait and see.  


But back to the purpose of affirmative action. I'd rather see someone get rejected from college when they're not able to succeed in college than to see someone get accepted and fail out after accumulating debt equivalent to a down payment on a house. If someone can't get accepted based on their grades out of high school or test scores or whatever, then they should get up to speed at a community college later and try again. I don't think that letting in a student who may not do well is helpful to that student in the long run. (But then again, who am I to make that call? That's why this is so conflicting for me).","58_1_1"

In evaluating if you should continue this friendship, I would ask if you can handle without too much anger, if she taps back on ""that was a long time ago?"" If she brings up this situation again, will you be fine with her having the feeling that black people are given scholarships they do not deserve? If not, I would fade away.

And black men being vocally anti black on social media has empowered other races to feel like they can say racist things to us with no consequences.","5"

I noticed it becoming more prevalent back in the 2010s, when I was still a teen. I could scroll on a YouTube comment section about a dog and his owner and see a random incel comment making it about women and how sad men are somehow. Or straight vitriolic content being pushed in recommends. I chalk this up to everybody and their dusty uncle getting hold of internet service, smartphones, and a podcast mic by the late 2010s and going off on black women on the internet for no reason. And all of the types that do these things are usually miserable and arent living the life they thought they as a man should live but theyd rather blame women (and  even kids they chose to have) than themselves.

It reached such high popularity in the 2020s though. Manosphere incel bullshit was and is everywhere. Black women, despite being such a small %, is always on the tip of peoples unwashed tongues. Even if we dont even interact with them like that! But Im noticing a small shift  I see people calling out their incorrect facts and statements in videos and clapping back in comments. I remember if anyone tried to bring it up back then, they were devoured and called too sensitive and but he has a point! You females need to be held accountable!!!. Now I think a lot of people, especially black women, are over it and Im loving it. The shift is small, but I see a lot of women are not listening to them and their stupid points anymore and are either ignoring them altogether or fighting back. But I think men are also noticing this, and might also feel in their bones that this is the last period of their relevancy so theyre doubling down and going harder on the stupidity online (and in person)& 


as the other commenter said, this might be the final phase before it starts getting better.","6"

(Let e mpreface this, I'm in the US and I don't know if it's international, and it's not all black men. There's just a growing sample)

It's...weird. I don't think it's just ""oh, I'm chronically online,"" either. It's out there, in the real world. It's like I'm seeing a specific emergence of black incels within the community. Like, misogynoir was already rampant in the community, but I'm seeing more and more black men talking from two sides of their mouth. 

The madonna and the whore paradox. You're either too saintly and can't keep a man, or you're a SLOOT for the streets. You're just not ""good enough for (some of) them.""

I'm also seeing WAY more posts about these same incel dudes pushing for other black men to travel to 3rd world countries to find 'real tradwives.' Like, there's nothing wrong with interracial dating, but I feel SORRY for these women who are marrying these egotistical chauvinists. The greencard is NOT worth it, especially with the emotional/financial abuse these dudes are spouting is the ""right way"" on their blogs, videos, and podcasts.

I've also been seeing an uptick of extremely hateful comments. Like it was bad before, but i've recently come across black women and non-blk men couples on IG and tiktok and their comments were SO FULL OF HATE. 

I've also seen black women who document their experiences living abroad and extremely hateful comments from black men telling them they don't belong in X country. I even saw one yesterday on Ig where a young black gal talked about her interest for anime and cosplay and Black men were telling her she's just a fake, the characters aren't blk (so therefore she shouldn't cosplay them) etc. etc. It's not the first time I've seen it, either. 

I also forgot to mention I saw another post where a black woman was talking about raising her biracial children and the nuances that come with race, and black men were attacking her for teaching her child that being biracial still means you have black blood, and that it could impact how authority/law enforcement could treat you. The men in the comments were saying, ""she was part of the problem and she was directly impacting \[their\] biracial children's ability to succeed.""

Now admittedly, some of the accounts could have been folks masquerading as black men, but some of the new-age Andrew Tate-esque talkshows  (some are plain..worse)  and the black men supporting them in the comments can't be fabricated.

I'm gonna say something that maybe isn't right, but I feel black women have had enough trying to uplift the black community and society as a whole at large. We need to stop playing superwoman and take off our capes. We need to stop setting ourselves on fire to keep others warm.

(again gotta stress, interracial relationships are wonderful! But if you have to talk down about your community to complement the other...there's an issue)

I also forgot to mention that I'm also seeing a bit of an uptick in racial rhetoric in the LGBT community, it's nowhere NEAR as large but I am seeing misogynoir cropping up.

 - Individualism: people are fixated on that capitalistic ""you have to *earn* everything"" and view reparations as a handout rather than a policy driven method of addressing centuries of wage theft and exploitation (that itself still won't fully address systemic racism). We're seeing it now in the conversation of student loan cancellations--they are unsustainable amounts of debt and gatekeep a valuable resource in the form of an educated population. Student loan debt elimination would only be harmful to the already wealthiest people in power who can afford the loss and in exchange we'd have a more educated population in less debt when there's a growing demand for more specialized labor. 

 - Willful Ignorance - they ignore the fact that forms of reparations have and do currently exist, but they generally oppose those too.

 - White supremacy - People have tangible benefits from white supremacy (even if it's still ultimately destructive and environmental issues alone will destroy humanity as we hit climate disasters which themselves are also racial and gender issues) but it won't stop beneficiaries from fighting to keep it in power because they stand to gain from maintaining white supremacy. When you're centered in medical research, financial opportunities, employment, entertainment, and every industry imaginable, they're gonna fight tooth and nail to stay in power even if they don't realize that's what they're doing.

 - Racism - Just gonna say it again. People will literally die for their anti-blackness and will happily harm themselves to that end if it they know it hurts someone else more.","6"

The Japanese and Jews recieved reparations in ""short order"" after the atrocities. Please bear in mind this is me listing their reasoning not my own. No enslaved person is alive today. Because these people do not truly understand the scale of the crimes against Black people, and they have never truly considered the long lasting effects, they cannot see how reparations are necessary. As you said, they view things like affirmative action as going ""above and beyond"" and a form of positive discrimination. They genuinely believe that since the end of *de jure* discrimination **every black person born has had the same rights (technically true by law) as any other group and therefore the same chance at success (definitely untrue).** It then follows that since it is true that no black person today was enslaved, and since they also had ""extra rights"" in affirmative action, that they do not deserve further compensation.

Of course, if we talked about reparations for Jim Crow and segregation, something that is, I think in the minds of black people folded into the slavery reparations issue but generally overlooked by others, I'd be interested to see what they say, since arguably many thousands of people today would have gone through that system and deserve compensation for discrimination. The problem though is that rather than it being a camp where named individuals were interned or murdered it was a prevailing system that targeted ""black people."" The courts have been unsurprisingly reticent to rule on things like racial bias even when proven to affect one group more than another (New Jim Crow). Who knows what they'd make of Jim Crow reparations seeing as they're more explicit than today's racial bias but still not ""specific"" enough to perhaps name specific instances of damage.","15"

Because guilt can't be inherited. There is no reason a white person today has to pay for the crimes of the past, nor that a descendant of a slave should be compensated for not having undergone these atrocities.

""There are still repercussions of slavery to this day""

That's why we should strive towards equal opportunities rather than reparations. Better public schooling, healthcare etc across the board. Not just for specific minority groups, but the disadvantaged in general. The poor white/hispanic/asian should get the same opportunities as the people held back due to a past of slavery or any other reason that put them 'behind' beyond their control.","39"

- No person alive today was a slave. It would have made more sense to pay living victims like how Jews were after WW2

- Most people come from families that played no part in slavery, whether because they were not rich planters, from the north, or immigrated after the civil war. Why should they have to pay from their taxes?

- How would such a policy work? Do mixed raced people get a smaller percentage than more black people? Are you trying to pay haitian and nigerians, because that isnt fair as they are recent immigrants. Do Oprah and Lebron get full payments despite being uber rich? If poverty alleviation is the goal, it would be better to make it income based so that poor people of any race can benefit. 

- And then we get to what reparations would even look like. One time cash payments, or annual checks like some sort of dividend? I dont think most people would buy into that.","40"

First, he's truly a thoughtless flake and had no respect for your time. He just didn't care that there was a set time to do something pretty integral to the opening stage of dating someone with the intentions of a relationship. It paints a bad picture of someone who might mean well but their priorities are out of wack, they're self centered and disorganized-- this person is also fashionably late to everything. Even their own mother's funeral type shit. The female equivalent of this knows the group wants to see a movie at 7:15 but at 7:10 everyone's pissed off because they can't just leave her and she's only half done with her makeup and its already been 45 minutes. I had a friend like this. The respect for other people's time was non-existent. She also changed boyfriends like socks. Shocker, I know.

Second, he's a crypto-chauvinist and wannabe player who thinks correctly prioritizing plans with a woman will make him look like a simp. This is the dude who's pride, insecurity and deep seated misogyny means that he will break his neck to find a way to let you know you're not a priority. I've even seen red pillers and PUAs swear on everything that you shouldn't show up on time to appointments with women because it'll make them look submissive and well trained. Its supposed to let the rest of us know that they are way more important than us and won't bend their schedule to our whims even if they themselves set the time agreed upon. Domestic abusers are known to purposefully show up hours later than a promised time so they can feel in control and dominant.

Third option, it was truly an unintentional goof and bruh forgot to hit the store. If he didn't, he wouldn't have eaten tonight or the rest of the week. He's probably bummed or even angry that the result is a deleted number and being cut off. BUT, that doesn't make you wrong. Maybe for the next woman he'll have his shit together and not end up in a situation like this where he looks like a flake.

I actually don't think its option 3 because if it was, he would have said ""Yes, I'm so sorry I'm running late but I forgot to go to the store. Mind giving me another half hour just to get shopping done? Something came up, but I'll be happy to give you my attention soon"". Instead he gave a half assed apology and tried to combine his errand with your virtual date and only give you half of his attention. That's insulting and it's a small but noticeable red flag.

So, I'm putting money on option one: he's a thoughtless flake. Good riddance to him.","3"

When he was 40 min late I called and asked where he was, and he was allegedly still on his merry way. After waiting an hour and a half for this guy to show up, I told him to go home. He didn't know I needed to be in bed early that night, but that's not the point.

I can think of so many situations in the past when dating someone that I let shit slide just because I thought it wasnt that big of a deal. Instead, I shouldve realised those were red flags and a good indicator of negative traits. I used to date a guy who could barely respond to my messages on time. Hours or even days would go by. I just dismissed it as, as long as everything is fine when were together it doesnt matter how long he takes to respond. We lasted for a few months but the same shit I ignored in the beginning was the same thing I ended up breaking up with him for. Got to the point where I was frustrated daily because my own boyfriend was increasingly difficult to get in contact with.

On the day of, he snubbed me and I never heard from him after he had told me a few days before that he would let me know. That was pretty much it for me, because he didn't respect my time and was fine with wasting it. I never got an explanation or an apology either, so I took things for what they were and let the friendship die.

My husbands culture tends to be time flexible. There's a technical term for it I learned in school, but I cant recall. People show up late for *everything*. Weddings, birthdays, dates, dinner. 

The upper classes are more timely since they tend to work in offices, but your average person in the village or middle-class parts of the cities are just *not* timely. If a merchant told you your furniture would be ready this Tuesday, they probably wont have it done until next Friday (if youre lucky). Yes, youll have to keep checking in. *In-person*. Do not expect them to track you down and let you know. >7<Ã½@

My husband had a habit of showing up late early on in our relationship. I was mad. I expressed that. He switched up pretty fast when he realized I was upset (though I could tell he was a bit confused about why I was hurt that he was 20 minutes late). In the end, it was a great opportunity for us to learn about each other.

As I became more secure in our relationship and experienced the many valuable ways he demonstrates his love and affection (which I wont list because this comment is already long), I became more flexible. Were back to a more casual conception of time and plans. I let him know if its time important, but time doesn't factor into our day-to-day interactions.

My bestie is a brother who isnt timely at all. If you have plans for 10 am, hes not leaving the house until 10 am. But hes a loyal and compassionate friend.

I can hit him up right now and say, Can I hold $50? and he wouldnt ask why (and he isnt loaded). He wont get upset if I dont offer to pay it back in three days. Hell hit me up when he needs it with no bitterness (But obviously, as part of honoring our friendship I usually get back to him first). I can call him any time of the day if Im upset and rant for an *hour*. Hell drop whatever hes doing 70% of the time.

Sometimes Ill text him, Hey I made food and have extra, come get you a plate? Despite making plans for that evening you may not hear from him again until tomorrow if you dont poke him. Sometimes my husband and I will eat it after a day if we get hungry. And bestie is not offended by that. Because he *knows* theyll be meal invites in the future.

Bestie is flexible so last-minute changes arent a big deal. Ofc, I keep them to a minimum. But hes a great person to have around when you pass a peach farmer on the side of the road and want to stop. Bestie is *never* in a rush. He has liberating easygoing fun energy. You cant know the beauty of it until youve experienced it. We got a weird mutual understanding unique to our dynamic.

If I let him know certain things are time-sensitive (like an appointment), hell be on time. Like my husband, I just have to make it *clear*. 

Some of my other friends are way more peculiar about time, so I respect that. I know X will be here no later than 1:02 pm and so I match that energy.

Each relationship has different rules. I adjust for neuroticism from my strict companions and I give leeway to my bohemian buddies because everyone brings something unique to the table outside of that.

New people being late used to trigger feelings of abandonment in me. My mother (who I didnt see much of for a while due to circumstances) was late for *everything*. Even picking me from school. Which could be scary. I was too tough to admit (to myself or her) that I was terrified of being forgotten. So Id just get passive-aggressive and testy towards her when she did show up. Wed get to scraping and no one even really knew what started it. >&<Ã¾@

It took years to realize that I was reacting towards others who were *not* my mother from a place of hurt. The relationship would usually be permanently soured on my end. I stayed feeling sore and abandoned. =

I was trying to protect my heart, so I dont blame myself. But if someone, *anyone*, had come to me with what you and the other commenter said, I would have benefited immensely. 

If I had been stuck in my previous mindset I would have missed out on not one, but *two* beautiful people. I honestly feel they were placed into my orbit by God to help me learn to loosen up, heal, and trust after a long life of feeling disregarded.

I love the example you gave about folks who work on schedules and family trauma around folks being late or not showing up at all. That can activate an anxious response and thats something we have to look at in ourselves. By no means should we be a pushover around our boundaries, but we can miss out on some beautiful people if we dont see whats behind our reactions. It takes time, I think. Im almost 40 and still learning.

This is core to understanding the false equivalency that comes from ""colorblind"" ideology. It is something that all sides of the political specturm(liberal, progressive, conservative, etc) adopt selectively. People with colorblind ideology think having anything attributed to race is negative because they are projecting from when things were attributed to whites at the detriment of non-whites. Thus they say things like race doesn't matter. Or that we shouldn't have institutions based off of *skin color*. They have internalized a literal interpretation of ""Seeing color"""". They fail to realize that ""black"" refers to more than just *skin color*, but an actual distinct culture of people which are part of the national identity all the same.

They then say ""well what if whites made things based off their own culture"", not realizing that mainstream society and that very concept are one in the same. They have convinced themselves that society is colorblind and ethnically agnostic across the board which leads to a lot of cognitive dissonance when addressing topics of race. They also seem to think things like HBCUs are exclusionary to them which is another form of projection.

HBCUs were unique in that they didn't restrict admissions based on race and so by definition were open to everybody(including whites) and the main nonwhite population at the time were blacks. They were always open to everybody and still are. The name even says ""historically black""(merely referring to a the *unique* existence of a university where blacks where actually allowed to attend) but is instead interpreted through projection/false-equivalency goggles as ""black only both in the past in the present"", when neither of the two were/are true at all.

If someone was born into a well-off or at least comfortable family, with parents who knew how to navigate parent-teacher meetings, standardized exams, and college admissions, where they didn't have to work to support their family, with no abuse happening at home, with an ethnicity that people tend to encourage academically instead of discourage, and access to the best schools and extracurriculars from a young age, did that person really get admitted on merit? Or did they win the birth lottery? 

I say this as someone with a lot of those privileges myself, people thinking that they're succeeding because they're excellent when they're actually playing life on easy mode annoy me. A lot of those same people lose their minds when faced with hardship, failure, or structure that isn't provided for them because they've never had to deal with that. Where's the merit in that? I guarantee that most of them haven't worked as hard as the kid who's trying to get good grades while also dealing with racist teachers and trying to make sure their family can pay their rent. I saw another comment about the massive amount of cheating (and nepotism) that goes on, which is true. Is that also merit? I hope colleges start admitting people who can demonstrate resilience, critical thinking, and creativity. A lot of the ""merit"" admissions lack that because all they know how to do is memorize facts, follow a path that someone else set out for them, and demand what they feel they're entitled to despite not earning it.

You'd be surprised how much you'd value a doctor who can care for you instead of just assuming they know everything when you walk in with a rare disease. There are so many shit doctors out here. You want a doctor who had to decide to do this. 

I'm tentatively hopeful that schools will choose other aspects to focus on, like income, which as a rich black person, makes more sense to me. Sure I was discriminated against at PWI but at least I could get into the best schools in my state at an early age. But I also know that in this country, if you don't enforce a federal standard, our shittiest states will inconvenience their citizens just because they can. So this will likely be another loss for our red state sisters.

The worst part is this was orchestrated by white people. They're trying to make minorities fight over affirmative action while legacy admissions still overwhelming favor white people.

You recommend the book only for them to turn it down. You beg and plead with them to read it but they just say, ""nah"".

I thought about the Sanchez name, too, for a while... but his daughter is apparently the basic definition of white girl with blonde hair.  I mean, in one of the new (leaked) episodes, there is even a reference to Beth getting re-married in some universes, to a Jewish guy.  Even ""The Artist Formerly Known As Rick"" still has the gray skin-tone of all the Ricks (except the green lizard Ricks, I guess?)  All in all, it doesn't really make sense.

I mean, I would bring this up to Justin Roiland over twitter, but I'd really rather not deal with the kind of response I'm pretty fucking positive I would get.  I mean, Roiland is brilliantly funny, but I also highly suspect he is kind of a dick, as are the people who follow him on twitter, likely.

Also, seeing as how its Rick &amp; Morty, even if they *did* address it, it would be one of those Rick meta-commentaries riffing on the social reasons for it happening to begin with or something.  With that kind of mocking tone he does, you know?

However, as long as there is more of Mrs. Pancakes and Mr. Goldenfold, I think I will be okay.  Especially Goldenfold.","8_2_1"

The whole familiar book deal, yeah I have those books and I'm making my SO read them because he was intrigued when I spazzed so hard when it came up.

Sort of.

Yeah, Steven Universe is a terrible, godawful creation.  ;)

Connie is Sri Lankan-American, not Japanese. They even drew her fighting style based on that of a martial art straight from her culture, Angampora.  This I think matters so much to the little Sri Lankan girls who have never seen a person of their background in American entertainment media before.

Nearly every voiceover actor you hear is a person of color.

Steven Universe is great for a good number of reasons, including thoughtful diversity (I don't just mean races, but perspectives, personalities, and the mature ways those are dealt with in the show, teaching kids to do the same), intricate and meaningful worldbuilding, and a good heart at the center of it all.

It's earnest in a way that's intelligent instead of cloying.

This show gives me the same feeling that the muppets in all the various shows they appear in did when I was kid, in that it has so many good messages without talking down to young people.

 It feels instantly timeless and it also appeals to adults without diminishing it's actual target, who are kids.  

Yes, everything about Steven Universe is fantastic.  ","10"

I'm planning to figure out a good news outlet to support, and may start some kind of website.

I had the thought, that, for our mental health, the Tower of Light meditation can be extremely helpful. It's from a super New Age book titled [Psychic Self-Defense](https://books.google.com/books?id=bLXB4XN-vDIC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=psychic+self-defense:+strengthen+your+aura&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZkpqU2qPQAhULjVQKHejxAlEQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=psychic%20self-defense%3A%20strengthen%20your%20aura&amp;f=false)--which, yeah, sounds woo-woo, BUT--it has you visualize your highest values and ideals forming a ""shield of spiritual protection"" around you, which I found very helpful at a time when I was recovering from severe depression.

As I just found out that I couldn't walk into a strange Starbucks without the mental safety calculations overwhelming me to the point of tears, I plan to start doing this every day:

The Tower of Light (Regular Method)

1. Breathe deeply and evenly (keep this up throughout the practice).
2. Progressively relax your whole body. (You could use the [Creative Plan of Relaxation](https://books.google.com/books?id=EbuUMal7geoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=creative+plan+of+relaxation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TnKMJTZpjE&amp;sig=qP4YqXJRUfbMNSrI30dcSMRZeGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH-NSw2aPQAhVKy1QKHfPDB5wQ6AEILjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=creative%20plan%20of%20relaxation&amp;f=false), but sometimes a briefer method may suffice). 
3. Stand erect without stiffness, arms at sides. (In making practical use of this method, you may not always find it possible or reasonable to stand. If you are walking, walk upright, evenly, calmly, arms swinging loosely at the sides. If you are seated, sit with spine erect, feet parallel and firmly planted, hands palm down on the thighs. In either case, proceed with what follows just as if you were standing. But when doing your customary practice you should always stand, unless prevented by serious health reasons).
4. Visualize all about you a long ellipsoid of intense bright blue light. It extends about nine inches beyond the surface of your body all around, and to about sixteen inches above your head and below floor level at your feet. (Your psychic aura is much more extensive than that, and is usually visualized in silver; but for defense purposes you need it to be blue, and it is easier to create the conditions you need in this smaller compass.)
5. When you can visualize (or simply be aware of) this well-defined field of intense bright blue light entirely surrounding you, visualize within the summit of that aura, slightly above but not touching your head, a globe of brilliant white light. 
6. Concentrate your attention on this globe, so that it becomes brighter, glowing white like burning magnesium. (You do not need to look upwards, just sense its presence.) Your are making this image to represent the light of your higher self, which is truly there; and you imagine this globe above your head, not touching, because you do not in any way identify your higher self with your conscious self, your ego-personality. 
7. Be aware of these two images: the intense bright blue ellipsoid in which you are entierly contained, and the effulgent white globe over your heaad, occupying the apex of the auric shape. 
8. Aware of the brilliant globe over your head, aspire to the highest good you are capable of conceiving; realizing, though this globe is a visualized symbol, it represents a part of true divine force.
9. When you feel ready, see that dazzling globe sending down glittering white light. This light, filled with silver sparkles, floods your aura and at the same time completely permeates you, coursing vibrantly through you. 
10. The outer shell of your aura remains sharply defined as an ellipsoid of intense bright blue, all filled now with the living, vibrant, sparkling, white light. 
11. Continue this formulation for some time (as long as you can effectively concentrate upon it) seeing it as a living, moving reality. The brilliance flows down continually into you and around you--it is inexhaustible, for it is a part of the source of all and in your aura it continually circulates, effulgent and sparkling, reinforcing that hard, sharply defined and brilliantly blue outer shell. Be aware of yourself, blissful and alert at the center of this glorious manifestation of diving power. Let the globe fade from your consciousness, knowing at the same time that it has not faded from reality.

If you are threatened in public:

The Tower of Light (Emergency Method)

1. Visualize at once the auric ellipsoid of intense bright blue around you, and, within its apex, just above your head, the brilliant white sphere of the light of your higher self.
2. Aware of the brilliant globe over your head, aspire to the highest good you are capable of conceiving; realizing, though this globe is a visualized symbol, it represents a part of true divine force. 
3. See that dazzling sphere sending down a glittering white light. This light, filled with silver sparkles, floods your aura and at the same time completely permeates you, coursing vibrantly through you. See the sharp blue outline of your aura's hard protective shell.
4. Keep this visualization for as long as the need lasts or as long as you reasonably can.

I have also found myself reciting the 23rd Psalm, and the Serenity Prayer, if you are into prayer. 

I pray for your safety, as I'm certain some of you are out there protesting in places that are nowhere near as safe as my very blue city.","1"

Not how that student's skills measure up to another student from a different school that may have had a more rigorous curriculum or grading policy. The other issue is the relative level of each course that contributes to GPA. A 4.0 for a student taking all honors or AP level math, social studies, science, art, etc. Is very different from a 4.0  in standard level courses.

Moving the meter on their bigotry would be nice, but isnt necessarily necessary to turn people like that. I think that if they can be made to understand that this kind of action against other POC groups translates to or concludes itself as an action against their own, anyone strategically-minded enough to do damage on this scale in the name of their own (as opposed to for their own name) would at a minimum want their impact on other POC groups to be neutral.

I understand how you feel. I look at it like this. If you have to explain your humanity to people as people look on in fascination, then you don't need anybody like that in your life because they imply they don't see you as human and it fascinates them to watch you try to convince them of your humanity like its a fucking college level debate competition or something. 

Fuck them. Fuck their chimpouts, fuck their dry snitching ass slurs they have for us. Fuck their varying attempts to have demeaning conversations with us, fuck their projections, fuck their fake attempts to empathise by wanting to be mammied by us, fuck their mediocre, bland attempts to copy us (r blackpeopletwitter, cough cough) fuck their reverse racism, and most of all, fuck their feelings (aka downvotes).

Yes. I'm tired too. I'm so fucking tired, and that's what brought me to this point. Keep doing you. I've learned to just take mental notes when talking to them. Keep reading, studying and learning. Watch the patterns and listen to what they say. Read them. And after that, nothing they say will matter all that much to you. And when they do something, always call it out. Call out all fuckery and use your poker face while doing it. They won't be able to say shit back to you. Be non responsive when you do it. Observe your surroundings, and always make sure you laugh whenever you can.

I went shopping some months ago and while I was getting eggs, a very small White child was nearby. The father saw me, and he hurried up and called his child and told him to ""come here"".

Constantly shouts (often quite literally) over me and everyone else when having discussions of race or other social justice issues. Even when theyre not situations that require shouting. Someone (white person) asked me if it would be racist to dress as a stereotype of another (white, historically marginalized culture. Think like trying to represent a Jewish person by wearing a big nose and yarmulke and holding a money bag). I open my mouth to share my thoughts and Ms Performative Ally interrupts to declare that white people dont experience racism and looks to me for validation. Like okay, but clearly in context, we are using racism as shorthand for ethnic bigotry and even so, maybe *screaming* over the black women whom the question was directed to isnt the appropriate response. 

Every potentially serious conversation goes like this with her. Ill start a sentence and shell literally shout to finish the sentence with some shit she learned from Tik tok or Twitter. Like no, thats not what I was going to say at all. I actually have both experience and academic knowledge of these topics, whatever I have to say about them isnt going to be performative outrage memes about gatekeeping girlbosses or melanin poppin or its just a social construct. 

Then the few times I actually dont get interrupted, and I disagree with/have a more nuanced view on whatever is trending on social media, she gawps and says but [such and such unverified Twitter account] said xyz. Girl, you dont even know if that is a real black person, much less that theyre an adult with any education or expertise. That could easily be a white teenager in Belarus stirring shit up (and sometimes it literally is. People lie on the internet all the time). Dont be posting listen to women of color memes when you dont wanna listen to the black women who are sitting right in front of your face. 

Shes also constantly sniping at people with degrees at relevant times, as if somehow, having a degree removes information from your brain.

In a footnote, Chief Justice Roberts exempted military academies from the ruling in light of the potentially distinct interests they present.

Justice Sotomayor called it arbitrary, while Justice Jackson wrote, The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).

Most of the conversations around WAP is very... disingenuous. I have no problem with the existence of the song, but its not exactly a feminist anthem.

There is a lot of conversation about reclaiming these  stereotypes, which makes no sense. The black women making this music arent living the Jezebel lifestyle they promote, nor do the overwhelming majority of bw. These women are not actually expressing themselves sexually, theyre being provocative by promoting a repackaged image projected in bw by white supremacy. 

I did see women get mad at Megan for not being feminist enough and owning her image. Like, no, Megan has no reason to live the life she talks about in her music. Its obviously not what she really wants. Songs like WAP, in my opinion, only proves that bw sexualities cannot actually be expressed, unless its by displaying the Jezebel stereotype placed on to us.

Yes. ""Not exactly"" is a very diplomatic phrase for it. :)

&gt; Have you ever noticed that bw who make this kind of music almost always openly say they dont actually live these lifestyles. 

It's almost like the performers (and their marketing teams) know that once people are distracted, they really aren't paying attention to the details. Almost as if this is a formula that has been successfully used for decades, and almost certainly far longer.

&gt; There is a lot of conversation about reclaiming these stereotypes, which makes no sense.

Yes. It makes no sense whatsoever. The stereotypes would need alternatives before they could be ""reclaimed"",  in the sense that a person could say, ""the stereotype means something else when I reclaim it"". To the average white person, those stereotypes have no alternative, and so unsurprisingly, the imagery only reinforces itself without any turn toward meaningful ""reclamation"".

Aside from that, as you mentioned, /u/Lemonaize -- the obvious question is to ask why it's so important to keep repeating such bad imagery (the Jezebel stereotype, for example) at all, instead of just letting it go and creating something better.","2_1"

Yes. [It's a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5Qu6i2EAUY) that I kind of wish everyone would have watched as many times as they watched WAP (especially since Cardi B. is in both, but only one video challenges bad old stereotypes about black women and sex work -- as well as equally bad new notions that sex work is a form of ""empowerment"").

It's ironic how the more thoughtful video (hint: not WAP) was actually created by a black woman who is a sex worker herself, but somehow is not trapped by misogynistic tropes and racist stereotypes. :)

Have you ever considered going to community college and transferring to a 4yr college, then to law school? 

I have a number of friends who actually started their journey to law school at a community college then they transferred to a 4yr and ended up going to some pretty decent law schools (UCLA, NYU, Emory) they're all from California tho and transferred from community colleges here.( I'm not sure if that makes a difference at all.)
One of those friends, wasn't academically ready when they started out in community college and had to take remedial classes to become college ready. Despite this, they recently passed the Feb California Bar with a 32.5% pass rate.  

Law school is challenging, but some schools are pretty supportive of their students and even have accomodations for students who have learning differences. 

I just wanted to share that there are other ways to get there. Not everyone starts out with a strong GPA/SAT scores out of highschool directly to a 4yr.","11_1"

My advice to everyone whose law applications I've read has always been to emphasize your narrative voice.

Why don't they take on the social affirmative action that makes life easier for white people at every turn? 90% of the time people complaining about affirmative action are rich white people bitter about not getting into their college of choice. I'm a white woman, who recently graduated from a very white, affluent high school so I've witnessed this first hand. During college admissions season every other girl was blaming her not getting into a top tier college on black people, instead of considering that maybe they (white students) hadn't worked hard enough. 

It got so bad that I ended up writing an essay for my school paper saying **a.)** white women are the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action anyways **b.)** minorities need elite educations more because they have to work against institutionalized discrimination when trying to get jobs **c.)** education suffers when there's a lack of diversity **d.)**all affirmative action really does is make up for educational opportunities minorities loose out on, so the playing field is even and **f.)** No one has ever gotten into or been rejected from college solely based on skin color!

As you read this, also think about Kamala Harris. Isn't it amazing? :)

&gt; He discovered that people in India had been following the trials of his own oppressed people in the US, and knew of the bus boycott he had led. Wherever he went, the people on the streets of Bombay and Delhi crowded around him for an autograph. At one point in their trip, King and his wife journeyed to the southern tip of the country, to the city of Trivandrum in the state of Kerala, and visited with high-school students whose families had been untouchables. The principal made the introduction.
&gt; 
&gt; Young people, he said, I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America.
&gt; 
&gt; King was floored. He had not expected that term to be applied to him. He was, in fact, put off by it at first. He had flown in from another continent, and had dined with the prime minister. He did not see the connection, did not see what the Indian caste system had to do directly with him, did not immediately see why the lowest-caste people in India would view him, an American Negro and a distinguished visitor, as low-caste like themselves, see him as one of them. For a moment, he later recalled, I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable.
&gt; 
&gt; Then he began to think about the reality of the lives of the people he was fighting for  20 million people, consigned to the lowest rank in the US for centuries, still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty, quarantined in isolated ghettoes, exiled in their own country.
&gt; 
&gt; And he said to himself: Yes, I am an untouchable, and every negro in the United States of America is an untouchable. In that moment, he realised that the land of the free had imposed a caste system not unlike the caste system of India, and that he had lived under that system all of his life. It was what lay beneath the forces he was fighting in the US.","2_1"

Hi, /u/Nymeria2015. :)

[Equality Labs](https://www.equalitylabs.org/) seems like a great organisation. It's inspiring to see a group like that exists. :)

&gt; Also, Pramada Gopalan, on twitter, an Oxford prof, writes extensively on how South Asians benefit from black community activism affording them greater access to white spaces that is shut out to the black community. She also talks about how most of the people from the subcontinent cone from a privileged( thousands of years of institutional privilege &amp; access to economic, political &amp; educational resources) background ( mostly upper caste) that puts them ahead of the curve in the west. 

I've actually been on a Twitter follow-spree for Dalit activists months ago. Time to have another look, starting with Pramada Gopalan. Thanks for mentioning her name.

&gt; The most radical Indians on Reddit are Indians in India, and they all hang out on the r/India subreddit. Desis are messed up in the head, and I try to avoid them like the plague. Even the self-enlightened ones!

Personal experience confirms your assessment, there. I felt like my mind was being pulled into a blender after just one evening of ""self-enlightened"" discussion. It took nearly a week to recover from the strange blend of depression and confusion afteward. :)

Although /r/india has lots of BJP/nationalist trolls, right? Maybe they've improved. I posted a new item there today (and to ABCDesis), so we'll see.

[First person: My caste privilege in India blinded me to the reality of racism in the US](https://scroll.in/article/963715/first-person-my-caste-privilege-in-india-blinded-me-to-the-reality-of-racism-in-the-us?fbclid=IwAR3PsgpgPnMCbAEy4dxhtKF7VXZBwBqkiW8kf8VZaR7HHkUO7Yj598SEotw)

&gt; Through casual conversations, I found out that Brahmins are just 5% of all the Hindus  not 25% as I had assumed, with neither the evidence nor the curiosity to find out.
&gt; 
&gt; Most troubling was the question: Am I just another shade of a white supremacist? Five or 25, the percentage didnt change the answer.

This is an amazing statistic and I definitely look forward to reading more about the actual versus perceived Brahmin population.

&gt; Like millions of privileged-caste Indians in the US, I watched movies about racism and critiqued them over cocktails, but rarely made any black friends. Some used to wake up the next day and equate Hindus subjugation under 15th century Muslim rulers in India with that of African Americans. Behind closed doors, they would even draw parallels between the prevailing Hindu nationalist sentiment in India and the undying spirit of Rosa Parks. Oh, the gall!

Very similar to my experience recently.

[Cisco caste discrimination case busts the myth of the South Asian diaspora as a model minority](https://scroll.in/article/966635/cisco-caste-discrimination-case-busts-the-myth-of-the-south-asian-diaspora-as-a-model-minority?fbclid=IwAR2vHgyQuAXamJNPULL5Y7Eu8Vk7VUk8JEAHtLap0rN3Zh5qlhbNH9qbiS0):

&gt; ...Indians are far from being a uniform or homogeneous group. Indians today constitute the highest earning and best-educated ethnic group, including Whites. Not surprisingly, they are overwhelmingly from well-educated and upper caste backgrounds. Despite their inherited privilege, they have fashioned an American success story for themselves, of struggling against the odds to achieve their status. This case suggests that a healthy dose of skepticism is required.

I was curious about this case, and on Reddit, I've heard a very familiar strain of racist rhetoric that usually begins with the typical ""rags-to-riches"" story about a family ""working hard and getting ahead"" because ""the greatest privilege is being in America"".

The perplexing parallels between ""Desi exceptionalism"" and ""American exceptionalism"" are so strong that they sound almost exactly alike. Conservatism/nationalism really does make high-caste Desi people (on Reddit) sound indistinguishable from angry, bigoted white men. ;)

In the meantime, I've have found the passage (excerpted from [a sermon Martin Luther King, Jr. gave](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/chapter-13-pilgrimage-nonviolence) on 4 July 1965 at Ebenezer Baptist Church), that seems to have inspired Isabel Wilkerson to make the ""caste"" connection directly and specifically to African-American civil rights.

Remember that these are the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. himself. Just imagine him literally saying these words, and feel their impact as you hear the sermon while reading. :)

&gt; ""I AM AN UNTOUCHABLE""
&gt; 
&gt; I remember when Mrs. King and I were in India, we journeyed down one afternoon to the southernmost part of India, the state of Kerala, the city of Trivandrum. That afternoon I was to speak in one of the schools, what we would call high schools in our country, and it was a school attended by and large by students who were the children of former untouchables ....
&gt; 
&gt; The principal introduced me and then as he came to the conclusion of his introduction, he says, ""Young people, I would like to present to you a fellow untouchable from the United States of America."" And for a moment I was a bit shocked and peeved that I would be referred to as an untouchable ....
&gt; 
&gt; I started thinking about the fact: twenty million of my brothers and sisters were still smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in an affluent society. I started thinking about the fact: these twenty million brothers and sisters were still by and large housed in rat-infested, unendurable slums in the big cities of our nation, still attending inadequate schools faced with improper recreational facilities. And I said to myself, ""Yes, I am an untouchable, and every Negro in the United States of America is an untouchable.""
&gt;

Thanks for your explanation. Even in the context of robbing, I've always wondered what comes at play. 

Arab/Asian/Latin stores sell in majority Black neighborhoods/districts, employees and bosses live in carved/gentrified areas, and weaponize ""language"" barriers against Black customers. Doesn't it give these leeches excuses to misinterpret the conversation? I'm pretty sure Black customers are simply asking questions. Since anti-black imagery is so powerful, they're using the same WS dog whistles: ""saggy pants"", ""looking suspicious"", ""dressed like a thug""... Tone policing comes into play, which combined together are disasters for conflicts \[likely interpreted as ""robbery""\].

Black Americans' sides on this issue are never considered or reviewed, just drowned out by more stories of how evil we can be.

I'm also noticing plenty of flaws within the Black community on how a vast majority of us view black immigrants. I'm not talking about viewing them badly, because most don't go out of their way to insult them. It's just that some go about mending relationships in an ass kissing manner. ","1_1"

except for that time that you did.  A clear case of self confirmation bias. 

Here's what you are failing to understand.  We, having been robbed of our names, our heritage, our culture, have become our own nation in a way.  We are a nation that is struggling to come to terms with our own identity but a nation nonetheless.  African Immigrants have their own ethnic identities that extend much father than just ""black"" and often have trouble communicating with those who may live just a few hundred miles from them in whatever nation they originally came from, since Africa was divided up among European lines with large amounts of ethnicity in each country, most African immigrants view African Americans as another one of those ethnicities.  Many African immigrants don't view things as ""Africans vs. African Americans"" like you do, they identify themselves either by their respective nation state or ethnic nation and often clash with others from other areas in Africa.  

While I do applaud your attempt to make things right, you continue to make this broad generalization ""based on your experiences"" and defend your original comments.  Until you realize that this conversation goes so much deeper than your ""experiences"" or at least stop making generalizations based on them, then it's not much of an apology. ","1_1_1"

I don't think it's a confirmation bias, because I don't allow that to influence my interactions with. I treat them no differently.

This is an issue that I think plenty of Black Americans are struggling with. We were clearly victims of identity theft so we don't really have an expanded definition beyond ""black"" and some feel some of kind of way because just about every ethnicity in the US has this definition. As a result, we created one with the Afro-centric movement which killed a lot of ignorant stereotypes of our own people and Africa. It's just that I think there are other ways about going it about it now. We have a special case, but we are trying to fit into the trend of what other Americans are.

I am not creating an ""us vs them"" mentality or paint everyone with a broad brush. If it came off that way, then that was not my intent. I'm just providing another side to the attack of Black Americans on black immigrants. I'm just saying that the reverse happens and it's overlooked. 

If this is what I've encountered from black immigrants, then wouldn't that relate to a bigger picture? These people don't live in vacuums. This has to come from somewhere. I'm not trying to generalize.

I didn't comment on the original thread because it made me so angry that I had to step away from my computer for a while. I do think some of your sentiments were grounded in legitimate concerns, which need to be discussed. Plenty of African immigrants have adopted a sort of internalized racism that is directed towards African Americans. Internalized racism is tricky, particularly when it affects how one views themselves and their related cultures. I remember someone on this sub saying how ridiculous is it for Africans to look down on African Americans, particularly when the products of the Civil Rights movement have made it possible for so many Africans to be successful in the States. 

The thing is, thepost came from an angle that ostracized African immigrants in ways that we often experience already. Apart from within our own families, there is little room for us to express our cultural concerns in the Western world. The diversity of the African diaspora allows us to identify with African Americans in some regards, but not in others. I think it is right to note that African immigrants and African Americans have differing needs when it comes to Affirmative Action. I think it is wrong to come from a perspective of lowering African immigrants rather than raising up African Americans. I use the words ""lowering"" and ""raising"" with respect to accessibility to the benefits of Affirmative Action only, but I think there are other cultural and social implications to this discussion. As seen on the original thread, this discussion about Affirmative Action was really just a stepping stone to talking about huge rifts within the African diaspora, rifts which, I feel, are due to internalized racism. 

For that reason, I encourage people to consider the viewpoints of African immigrants. Like I said, there exists little space for African immigrants to develop a mainstream cultural identity in the Western world (particularly in the US and Canada, the UK seems a little bit different from what I've seen). This causes a lot of African immigrants to choose how ""black"" they want to be in a society that a) doesn't really recognize their own African cultures and b) denigrates the various expressions of African American culture that are already struggling for their own footing. A lot of African immigrants end up denouncing African American culture for fear that society has lumped them into their extremely racist idea of black people. All this is said not to excuse internalized racism, but to explain it so that you understand the background of African immigrants (who have most likely struggled with internalized racism at some point in their lives) who read and were rightly offended by your post.

In general, I think the post was divisive in a way that was not intended, especially when the topic could've been handled much better. It is an interesting topic, though.

Edit: I used the words ""you"" and ""your"" a lot, but I don't mean to place *all* of the focus on you /u/_Liquorice_, I'm just addressing the position that a lot of people were offended by in that post. I changed the wording a little.","2"

I would like to open a dialogue about the divides amongst the communities. These discussions already do exist, but they seem to be only from the perspective of Africans and other immigrants, which completely demonizes Black Americans. When Black Americans speak about the unprovoked acts of discrimination against them, they are silenced and matched with more stories from Africans and other black immigrants. Most Black Americans who are willing to enter this discussion are well aware of how Africans and other black immigrants are treated.They, like myself, are all ears. Black Americans are very surprised when the reverse happens unprovoked, which occurs a lot.

I don't mind it when Africans distance their culture and nationality from Black Americans. We have different cultures and they are rarely distinctly recognized. We are lumped in the same category solely due to skin color. I think it's nice to celebrate our cultures. I just hate when Black American culture is attacked and viewed as inferior or due to the internalized racism, like you said. The twerking discussions on tumblr comes to mind as an example. 

I'm not sure how to put this without sounding offensive, but I feel like Black Americans lose the most when they put up the effort to unite. It goes beyond this AA debate, but also into our own culture. Some sacrifice and toss their own people under the bus for unity, but Africans and other immigrants would never do the same. Black American culture is forever seen to be in the shadows of African culture and it's endorsed by other Black Americans. I have never heard the same forced upon Caribbeans or Latinos/Hispanics. I could go on and on about this, but I hope this adequately explains the point I was trying to make.

An example: lets say a school has a culture day.

I posted a youtube link showing a clear example of African Americans discriminating against African Immigrants, and you still question the validty of that happening and try to play it off as ""just children being little shitheads.""

While we should have this discussion, you have framed this as if there is some conspiracy or something played against African Americans by African immigrants and there is this universal double standard against us in favor of them.

You are seriously misunderstanding what these parallels mean.  The reason people draw these parallels, like from the deep kick drums in hip hop to the percussive sound of tribal drums, are to STRENGTHEN our identity, to give it roots, not to say that it is not our creation.

My ancestors weren't brought to this country against their will or enslaved. I simply do not suffer from the same history of oppression as black Americans. 

I also personally have access to middle class privilege and some weird kind of inherited racial privilege that I don't have a name for through my white, highly educated mother and her relatively well-off (also white) side of the family.

As for tension between black immigrants and black Americans, I've seen it go both ways. I must say, though, the mistreatment of immigrants by Americans I've seen was only through young people in a high school, shun-you-for-being-different kind of way. The disdain that some African immigrants have for black Americans (can't comment on black immigrants from, say, the Caribbean because I don't know any well enough) seems like a different beast altogether.

As an African-American (ethnically, from Georgia, to be specific) at a top 5 school in this country, I feel bad, but I have to agree. Sorry, but 90% of the people who attend my school are African immigrants (Nigerian, specifically) and first-generation Jamaican. 

I also happen to work in the admissions office at my school, and I know for a fact that my school goes out of its way to recruit Nigerians and Jamaicans, and does next to nothing to recruit African-Americans. Harvard came looking for diversity applicants below the Mason-Dixon line. My school did not.

I believe that everyone deserves a chance at a stellar education, but I know for a fact that a number of elite universities are purposefully filling up their diversity quota with black immigrants. That personally really bothers me, not to mention a lot of the Nigerians and Jamaicans at my school feel superior because of this. 

I am no longer a proponent of AA, after seeing this happen first hand. I hope I do not sound anti-immigrant, as this is not my intention, nor where my heart is.","3"

I'd need to see evidence to back up this claim.  I highly doubt universities are systematically turning down qualified African Americans in favor of similarly qualified black immigrants.

But it is not surprising to me that black immigrants (or immigrants in general) are 'overrepresented' at elite colleges.  Immigrants represent the small portion of a foreign population that had the hustle, drive and motivation to leave their country (which presumably had less opportunity) to come to America.   I'm a black immigrant and my parents were certainly not rich, but they stressed that they made this move to make a better life for me and my siblings.  When you have that mentality in the family, children like us take education more seriously than many of our peers (white &amp; black), and we have the parental support to continue pushing us all the way because they remember why they moved here in the first place.

Back to your comment, the elite universities didn't go out of their way to recruit me.  I did well on the PSATs and started getting catalogues in the mail from UPenn, Brown, Caltech, MIT, etc.  No one invited me to visit campus until I was already accepted at my university of choice.  I wasn't getting any visits or phone calls begging me to join the black immigrant family.  My scores spoke for themselves.  I worked hard for them.","3_1"

I suppose you'll just have to take my word for it, considering I've seen it for myself. And by ""seen"" it, I mean, an emphasis on looking for students of color (this may pertain to my school specifically) from the international student applications. This is known. There are other factors of course--I can say that my school in particular does this to ensure that our sports teams remain white and affluent, because many international students are accepted on the strength of their grades, versus having ""amazing"" extracurriculars (great sports record, cured a disease due to wealthy parent sending them to summer camp each summer, etc.) Do you actually attend one of these schools, or are you assuming that this can't possibly be true?

And I'm sure you didn't mean to sound insulting, but I assure you that I and every other African American who attends my school have the same ""hustle, drive, and motivation"" that stems from the fact that my own grandparents would have never had the opportunity to attend my school. I'm really not sure why you would make the (underlying) assumption that so many African-Americans inherently lack that same drive. I also have the same parental support, and also did well on the PSATs and worked hard for my grades as well.

Sorry the universities didn't go out of their way to recruit you, but know that they do this. Each top 5 university does this. My school sends representatives to Nigeria and Jamaica every year to the top schools in those countries to recruit.  You could say that another issue with this is that my school is purposefully inviting international students with $$$, given where they go looking.  But anyway, we invite these students to the school, on our dime. It is a very big deal.

I appreciate your comment here, but I don't think you are really privy to the inner workings of the admission machines of these schools.","3_1_1"

I base this on my own personal observation having attended one (not Harvard), and also by looking at [Harvard's own statistics on international students](http://www.hio.harvard.edu/abouthio/statistics/pdf/StudentsSchoolCountryAlpha13-14.pdf).  I just ran a quick calc on this data and assumed everyone from sub-saharan countries/caribbean were black (except Tanzania, where I estimated 50%, many well educated ppl of Indian descent) and that 10% of students from Canada, France, UK, were black.  

Perhaps your school is atypical, but in general 90% of the black population at elite schools come from residents of the U.S.A. (African Americans and black immigrants included), and maybe 10% from international countries.  So I don't really buy your general assertion that these international students are taking up all the spots for African Americans.

Second, I never suggested that African Americans that attend elite schools did not have 'hustle, drive, and motivation'.  I know many of these folks and they often worked just as hard, or harder than I did.  **Everyone** at these schools have that drive/motivation.

What I suggested was that immigrants have a higher representation at these institutions because they are a self-selected population of people that have high ambition and hustle.  To leave a country behind to venture into something unknown takes a certain mindset that I think is also conducive to having kids that work hard in school.  Immigrating to the U.S. is generally a monumental life decision, and that decision has a huge impact on making sure the children work their ass off not to waste the opportunity to be here.  

The Jamaicans/Nigerians that didn't value education/hard-work/hustle are probably still back in the home country hoping for a better life without making it happen.","3_1_1_1"

Another clarification, and I realize that I just made a gross generalization. When I said international, I was including literal non-citizens, as well as first generation students (i.e, children of non-citizens). For example, I have a friend whose parents are Liberian, and her two older siblings were born in Liberia. She, the third and final child was born here in the U.S. I suppose I subconsciously included people like her, because at least the ones I have come in contact with do not consider themselves American, nor do they have a preference to be lumped in with African-Americans.

With that being said, I want to correct both our statements here. 10% (or less) of the black population may well be international, but African-Americans (ethnically, the descendants of American slaves) do not make up 90% of the black population of these schools, but far less. I know this because I recently participated in a school-wide sociology study on this very topic.

Although I do also want to clarify, in case this wasn't clear---I am not blaming said immigrants for their ""over-representation"", I am blaming universities like mine for (what I believe) disingenuously, and purposefully creating diversity quotas as I described above that favor international students and children of immigrants. I think this is problematic, and so obviously not the purpose of affirmative action.

I know AA is a touchy subject, but can we please remember that 1) Not all black immigrants are African. Some are from the Caribbean and are dealing with the historical legacies of slavery too. On top of that they are dealing with economic disparities from structural adjustment. 2) If black immigrants are benefiting from AA more than African-Americans, it's not their fault, it's the fault of the system...so criticize that first instead of taking low blows at an entire group of people. 3) Black folks aren't even benefiting from AA the most, so once again, the system is flawed, NOT the people benefiting from it.

I know some black immigrants can be dicks, but judging from comments anytime the topic is about Africans vs African-Americans, it goes both ways.

In an ideal world we would love to pick up arms and join you in your fight. But you have to factor in the fear that immigrants feel after 9/11. We don't have the same protections afforded to you as a citizen and know any small misstep could lead to a deportation.

I went to a public university that was 89% white at the time I went, waaay back in the mid 2000s, so they had no excuse for that BS, and had even gotten in trouble for it before. They didn't offer the degree I really wanted, but they had given me a full ride, and my parents told me if I didn't get a full ride, I had to join the military, because they didn't know shit about paying for college. I had gotten $75,000 of non-loan financial aid offered to me by a near-Ivy-equivalent that cost $80,000 a year to attend, but I guess fuck taking out $5,000 a year in loans to get a degree from a nationally-prestigious school. Anyway. 

Yes, I had a difficult time, but I also had some great times. One of the best things that happened was getting plugged into the university counseling center. It didn't solve all my problems right away, but it set me on the path to my current mental wellness, for which I am thankful every day. 

After school, I bummed around for a few years, because I was burned out as fuck by my junior year of high school, and had pushed myself through another six years of school after that. Graduating from college is still the most difficult thing I've ever done. Battling depression and anxiety while also experiencing the ugly falling-apart of your super-dysfunctional family and also navigating a series of abusive relationships, and also trying to get a goddamn education in a place that you're not sure you want to be, that constantly throws out signals that it doesn't really want you...yeah. Not easy. 

What really turned my shit around was getting my Masters. By that point I knew what I wanted to do, and I knew more about who I am, so I had a core of strength to draw on. Also, a good medication regimen and access to a quality therapist who specialized in dealing with cases like mine. Srsly, I cannot stress how valuable professional mental health support is. 

Even with all that, I don't feel like college was a waste, because...how to explain? When I stood, feeling like a draggled husk of a person in a cap and gown, and received that piece of paper, a switch flipped in me. I thought, *I have an education. I got my education, and nobody can ever take this from me, no matter what happens.* And that's true. I learned so much about how to think critically, how to seek information to feed my love of learning, how to build new knowledge. And I made that journey myself. ","2"

LUCKILY for my second year both mine and my mom's loan app was rejected so I couldn't go back even if I wanted to. I transferred to community college and then to a local 4 year and things were still rough tbh and I thought about dropping out pretty much every semester. The only thing that kept me going was seeing my mom struggle with low paying jobs because she didn't have a degree I didn't want that for myself and she absolutely didn't want that for me.

One tip: ask for free upfront sessions with a therapist or for a reduced rate for a quick consultations. I would also be really upfront on the first session about the racial discussion you want to have. Just because someone is black doesn't mean they will get it so you have to make sure, no matter who it is. 

EDIT: be careful about the word ""understanding"" here. Therapists are trained to help you deal with your depression, no matter what the cause is. If you're a victim of sexual assault or have had a parent die, or are just a more anxious person, that will all affect how you see and experience the world.

Well if you wanna hear my thoughts: (I wrote this comment earlier but deleted it, worried that it would distressing)

I could be wrong, but I feel like if it weren't for affirmative action (and the university having a specific quota to meet in regards to ethnic minorities) then I may have not been accepted - but keep in mind, this is a rural area.

I was top of my class, had a high SAT score, and my university accused me of having fabricated my grades. 

I ended up having to take exams called TSI's (exams meant to determine whether I needed to be placed in remedial classes) to ensure my grades were not fabricated. 

(Mind you, I applied and was accepted - got the offer letter and was still subjected to this. I think my SAT score was 1346. So it wasn't as if, I had failed classes or had a poor SAT score)

I took all 5 exams (English, math, science, history, and reading comprehension) starting at 9am and didn't finish them until 6-odd something pm. All of this was on the fly! 

I went to the university bright and early to inquire about why I couldn't enroll into my classes. I went early thinking it would be a 15 minute solution:/

Then, I was informed that I had an enrollment block from the registrars' office stating that my grades in HS needed to be verified. (THEY HAD ALREADY RECEIVED MY OFFICAL TRANSCRIPT AND TWO LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATIONS!)

(Not only did I have to do the exams, but it was like 5 days of running up and down at the University in which they pulled everything out of the sky hoping to rescind my offer letter)

After experiencing this I told my mom I didn't want to attend the college, but I was forced to (another story for another day, but I had to attend the college near me to stay home and assist my family)

At my college in bumfuck, TX I also met other minority students who experienced similar abuses during their matriculation. 

Once I was in, I was often the only black girl in most of my classes. Even in huge study halls of 250 students, I was often the only melanted human in a sea of people. If I weren't, then there were maybe 2 or 3 other black gentlemen who were prominent sports members. 

It was also a struggle because throughout my tenure in my particular university, I had the solemn realization that I was WAY overqualified to be there. Many of my...mayonnaise counterparts couldn't even spell or made me want to bang my head on the wall when they read. 

Many of them were there because of Daddy's money, or mommy's Alma Mater in some Greek organization! 

I shared this story because all of those nasty feelings from that hellish week resurfaced upon hearing the verdict. 

Minority students in larger and more diverse cities may not (hopefully) be as affected. But certainly little racist towns in Fuck Empty, USA will be heavily affected. 

Refugees, digital nomads, and other people who have relocated to rural areas hoping to make a living and someday own a home will be most affected. 

Worse yet, if the Supreme Court can make this ruling for colleges, we can only buckle up in rural areas as the workplace may be next. 

I worry about my fellow brethern stuck in Red areas with limited opportunities....","2_1_1"

Impostor syndrome was tough but people from all ethnic groups had that at my school. 

For my bachelors, I went to art school so the talent required to get accepted is harder to fudge around to let different people in. If anything, economic background was a bigger factor, and mainly for need-based scholarships (my school didnt do merit based because everyone accepted had the merit by default)

The top 20 MBA is a bit more open about wanting URMs (and typically has dismal numbers across the top 20), so there are fellowships prep programs that are centered around preparing URMs to apply to schools and ultimately, jobs. 

As a result, theres tons of anecdotal bias amongst MBA applicants (see r/MBA) who believe URMs with good test are auto-admits to Harvard, etc. Especially amongst Asian students who get the short end of the stick because there are so many of them applying.

Ginsburg usually does not make such bold statements that I know of and I am glad she said this.

Low SAT's correlate with higher drop out rate/low grades.  However, SAT score is most highly correlated with class and income, not IQ, GPA, or race.  The richer you are, the higher your score, and the better you will do in college because well, this should be obvious by now, but the more you've been prepared by everyone around you for writing papers, reading high level material.  If you are wealthier you've likely gone to a nicer school, possibly had tutors, better parental support (parents aren't overworked and underpaid).  Nothing to do with talent, intelligence or hard work.  Although being rich doesn't cancel it out.

We should certainly talk about race but lets also talk about class.  Weiss and Fisher are not only privileged by race but by class.  Both suburban, both from college educated homes, one has legacy connections.  Lets not assume that some poor white kid out of Appalachia who could be struggling with poverty just as much as his black peer from Detroit, is bitching as much as Suzy Weiss is.  Those kids are just as surprised by admissions as poor urms.  And at more elite institutions can be privileged in admissions too though the struggles they go through I think cancel out this whole do they deserve it argument.

We should talk about Affirmative action.  No doubt.  Should it be more based on race than class?  Is it fair that those who benefit the most tend to be wealthier urms rather than poor ones?

Personally, I see a variety of pros and cons to the current system of affirmative action, which I've taken the liberty of listing below.

Pros:

1. Higher *overall* rates of URM enrollment.
2. Grants low-income URM students a better shot at upward mobility. 
3. Fosters a social environment on campus that is more hospitable to URM students. 
4. Helps to ensure that URM students are not on the receiving end of discrimination in the college application process.

Cons:

1. Often benefits middle-class black students more than low-income blacks students. According to statistics, the vast majority of black students at ""selective"" institutions attended private schools and came from middle/upper-middle class families.
2. Has the unfortunate consequence of ""promoting"" URM students with improper high school preparation to universities that they aren't academically ready to attend.
3. Does not address URM student retention deficits. A sizable percentage URM students end up either failing to attain a degree in four years or dropping out of university altogether; in many cases, these statistics could be explained by a myriad  of potential financial, social, and educational difficulties that are primarily encountered by URMs.
4. Serves as a band-aid for real problems of resource inequality and discrimination in our nation. The average black family making $70,000 annually lives in the kind of neighborhood that would only be considered by white families with a $30,000 annual salary. According to Princeton's 1998 ""Discrimination in a Low-Wage Labor Market"" study, blacks with no criminal record have a slightly lower chance of gaining an entry level job than white *felons.* And finally, the unemployment rate for black college graduates is nearly two times that of white college graduates (*in the same age ranges*). AA doesn't even come close to ameliorating many of the major problems that our community suffers from in contemporary American society.","1"

Every now and then, elite schools ""take a chance"" on an applicant with scores that are below benchmark levels due to other factors (i.e. a compelling personal story, a disadvantaged background, etc.); unfortunately, when AA does end up *""benefiting""* URM students in these situations, you will occasionally observe higher-than-average failure rates.","1_1_1"

Of course, the irony being since they could afford to spend money on educational benefits then they can't say that they did well *just* on their merits, but with their money.

I honestly think it's the case that lower-income students don't apply to ""selective"" schools because they are mostly majority white, and even though they could get in, they don't think that their presence would be welcome, or they honestly just don't want to be in a white majority campus whose average socioeconomic background is substantially higher than from where they come from. I know I'm not the only black person who sometimes has the gut intuition, for better or worse, that the wealthier a white person is, the more likely they are to be racist. ","1_2"

The average composite SAT score for someone with an income in the $20,000-$40,000 range is about 1370 (on the 2400 scale), which is below average by about 130 points. There are a ton of people in all income brackets who have wide variety of scores, but most of the ""good"" scores are concentrated in the high income brackets. For this reason, I do note that only a small percentage of poor URMs actually end up benefiting from AA, because a test-taker would have to (at the very least) achieve scores that are *slightly above average* to start reaping any gains. URM scores at lower income brackets are even worse than the national averages, which shows that we've got a ton of work left to do in reforming our educational system. I'd still imagine that there are certainly *some* well-scoring, low-income URMs who shun big-name schools due to racial concerns; I know of a lower-middle class black guy who attained a 2300 on the SAT and received an offer of admission from Harvard (but turned it down in favor of a local HBCU that specialized in engineering.)

As for the whole correlation between class and racism, I'd actually say that it depends on what type of racial prejudice you are looking at. The ""South will rise again,"" neo-Confederate types that I encountered in my younger years were almost exclusively lower-middle class or poor. Most hate groups tend to be attractive to working class, *""disenfranchised""* white men who have an axe to grind with blacks, immigrants, or racial minorities in general. However, if you are a middle class/wealthy *racist* white person, then you no longer need to run around in the forests with a bunch of uneducated yahoos to oppress blacks; you can easily trade in the traditional white sheets for a *badge and a gun* or *a business suit* (while still helping to enforce white supremacy.) So, although I wouldn't say that high-income whites are *more* racist than low-income whites, I would argue that they are better at concealing their bigoted attitudes.","1_2_1"

The Supreme court article seems to say that the lower court did not ""closely examine"" the school's claim, but I'm looking at [the court document](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/app/briefs/fisher_appellee_brief.pdf), and it has a lot of explanations and statistics that seem to prove that the **very limited** way they take race into account is necessary to their diversity. 

&gt;the legal standard known as strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice...the burden of proof is on a university to show that each applicant is evaluated as an individual and not in a way that makes an applicants race or ethnicity the defining feature of his or her application

Looking at the court documents, it looks like UT described their process in detail, and conducted studies &amp; surveys on diversity, and presented all of that in writing.

 UT accepts most of its students in a ""colorblind"" way: top 10% of every senior class (in Texas) gets in. The others get one score for grades &amp; tests, and another for ""a personal achievement index."" 

The ""personal achievement index"" includes 2 essays, leadership, activities, service, and ""special circumstances."" 

""Special circumstances"" include 
&gt;socio-economic status, whether the applicant is from a single parent home, language spoken at home, family responsibilities, socio-economic status of the school attended, and average SAT or ACT score of the school attended in relation to the students test score, and race.

So, if it's evenly divided, 50% is scores &amp; grades. The remaining 50% is divided further, into 5 categories, 10% each. One of those 5 categories is divided into 7 categories, and one of those categories is race. So race is far less than 10% of a deciding factor--if you divide down that far, it's less than 2%.

To top that, the documents show that the school tried admissions without even this tiny bit of race--they had the 'special circumstances' without race before, and the numbers showed too few minorities in classes. 

I'd really like to think that this wasn't a waste of time, but it seems like UT obviously already satisfies the Supreme Court's criteria. So what was the point, exactly? I'm vaguely disappointed.","6"

She looked at him with frustration and pitty  and finally asks, ""why are you here doing what youre doing?. You're white. Youre a man. Endless opportunities are here for you.

I wonder how many of them would call me a n***** if they had the chance to do it. Let's face it. Those of us who live in the USA have had moments where a White cashier at Walmart could summon all of the smugness of the entire Fox news staff just because he or she had to ring up a Black person that had the audacity to stand in their line. All the while, they don't even know that the Black person may be making more money than them while the cashier is getting food stamps and Medicaid. And yes, OP I agree with number 4. They better ask one of their friends to give them a job. Nepotism is the main source of Affirmative Action they never talk about.

I've seen the smugness of poor White people. I've dealt with it. I was friends with someone up until I got **a TV and a car**. Yes. My poor broke college going ass had the nerve to get a TV and a basic ass car where the only feature it had on it was that it could start up and go, and that was enough to cause trouble in her mind.  The interactions escalated into her telling her children to be afraid of me, so whenever they saw me, the mother would act cold, and her child would shriek in horror, when the kid would be excited to see me and they would say hi before I was able to purchase my petty ass items even though I was cordial the entire time. I had no idea I was in a competition with her and her family. I was just tired of taking the bus and not having any form of entertainment in my pre furnished studio apartment. :P

Another time, with a completely different person I made the mistake of mentioning that I was going to college and all the ugliness started to the point of insults. I avoid them all together.

So I definitely understand where you're coming from OP. Lyndon B Johnson once said the following about poor Whites: ""If you can convince the lowest white man that hes better than the best colored man, he wont notice youre picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and hell even empty his pockets for you.""

But enough about that, here are my problematic views.

1. I hate mental illness. I hate mentally ill people. But I hate them because I suffer from depression and anxiety and I hate it. I hate the fact that I have these problems, and how they've hindered me. I never wallow in it, but instead I get mad because I work hard to get away from all of it. I did it to the point where I put on a different persona for several years in hopes to change my mind. It didn't work, it just made me more depressed.  However, I do have enough brain cells to understand that we all need help, and we shouldn't be hated because of these issues. I feel the same for those who are autistic, even though I am not autistic but I have an autistic sibling. I hate how mental illness is looked at in American society. It's disgusting, and makes me really think that those who look down on those who have mental illness are the ones WITH the mental illness, but they're trying to hide it or something.  I also hate people who pretend to be mentally ill like its some new aged shit to make someone feel edgy. Fuck each and every single one of those people who play mentally ill like it's fun. 

2. I think feminism is really the fight to walk around naked in public and not shave. It has to be a real fucking luxury to fight for the right to be naked while having your nipples and pubic hair out in public when Black women can't get jobs based on whether they wear their hair natural, or what their name sounds like.

3. People fighting for the right to be tattooed or modded is dumb as fuck. People walking around like [some of these pictures](http://www.tattoo.com/blog/10-incredible-body-modifications?nopaging=1) freely, but let a Black person try to go shopping while wearing no mods or tats and any article of clothing, especially a fucking hoodie. Watch what happens. 

4. Hip hop is not for everyone, and the same goes for the rest of our genres of music. A lot of these White artists have low opinions of Black people, so they just show up and rap/sing/dance, etc because they think they can do it better than Black people. They only entered the arena for supremacy, and nothing else. The same goes for a lot of their fans. If they can't respect the architects and the rest of the people who look like the architects in public and private, fuck every last one of them. 

E: I don't think any of these will change in my mind except number one. Right now, I'm okay with that. 
E2: Added more words.
E3: Cackles at downvotes. They know I'm right. They know damn well they're over there looking stupid as fuck.  ","12"

I honestly don't even see how that is problematic. A lot of what I see from white feminism is complaining that they can't wear as little clothing as they want. The only worthwhile thing I hear from that camp is society should teach boys not to rape. Of course that is usually accompanied by exclaiming women should be able to eschew clothing and that dress codes are sexist. How privileged are you that one of your biggest complaints gender wise is not being able to always dress like you're about to work a pole? I truly believe mainstream feminism not only lacks intersectionality but is being led by people who don't realize that they have been fed by media that being scantily clad increases worth their entire lives or narcissists.

I used to be told I was smart. I graduated with straight F's. It wasn't until I was older and picked up a parenting magazine that I learned a hypothesis as to why this is.

See, you get told you're smart, you're expected to live up to it. But it's a bar, set high, and indeterminable and vague. But if you don't try, you get told still you're smart, even if things like your grades don't show it. I mean I know in school you put a pop quiz in front of me I'll ace it fine. I used to read the text books they give us cover to cover while the teacher was off lecturing. But being smart... it's not all that great.

The idea I read was that you don't tell your kids (or yourself) that they're/you're smart. You praise the effort. And you put in the effort. But as I'm typing this, I scroll down and see that Afle has already said the same thing essentially.

So I'll cut myself short here and simply add the following. It's true. Putting the effort into something is a hundred times better than feeling like you're something. When I was a soldier I felt dumb as bricks because I knew absolutely zero about guns and the only military tactics I knew I learned from playing Starcraft (Which turns out not to work so well in real life.) But you take what is in front of you. You break it down into little pieces. And you set aside some time to learn all those different pieces and it works.

It helps me at least when tackling things I otherwise never felt I could.","4"

I think being told you are smart or ""gifted"" really destroys a lot of your self esteem.  Its like if you get something or do well you automatically thinks its because you're smart rather than because you worked hard or really like said subject.  Then if you mess up or don't automatically get something you immediately think, ""Oh shit, I'm so stupid.  Why can't I get this thing like I get that thing?"" 

Because of these thoughts my academics were irregular because I tended to either perform very well because when I got something, subconsciously I put more effort into it... and under perform because when I didn't immediately get it, I just didn't do it or put in the effort at all.

College is good because you can take more stuff you are good at but I know I really need to realize not being good at everything is perfectly ok.

Advocating for homosexuality to be punishable by death. Countless times on many of the popular black blogs, BW have celebrated certain countries making homosexuality illegal(with the punishment being death). They've openly admitted to being happy that it was happening, and wishing that America would do the same thing. (meaning they'd be willing to vote for it). 



2. Extreme featurism, colorism, and transphobia. Countless times have BW including **darker** skinned black women accused a black women they didn't like of being ""a man"" (transgender). Whenever someone commits a crime and they have any kind of masculine traits, they push them to the trans community. (I don't have to explain how harmful that is). 



3. Supporting males that commit violence against the LGBT. When I was scrolling through YouTube one day, I came across this videos of members of the LGBT being attacked by a group of black men. I won't go into detail because what happened was disgusting. Made the mistake of reading the comment. Black women defending this behavior saying ""no one has to agree with what they do."" ""They must've said something to deserve that."" This isn't the first time this has happened, this is just an example.



4. Conspiracy theories. This is another bit of transphobia. If you've ever been down the illuminati rabbit hole, you'd know that a BW pushed the agenda that Megan thee stallion is transgender and her real name is (Marcus). They came to this conclusion, by putting her picture up side by side with a dude who looked like her. That lead people to say that she deserved to get shot, because Tory lanez found out she was a man. 



5. Calling every abusive black man gay. Everytime a man does something remotely wrong to women, they push the idea that there's no way this man is straight. (Ex. Zesty, sassy, DL).



6. Supporting people like Boosie. Boosie had his own children molested because he didn't want them to be gay, said disgusting things about Lil nas x, talking about D-wades daughters private area, and probably so much more that I don't know about. For the first part a lot of black women said it was perfectly fine and that people shouldn't worry about what he does with his kids.



7. Allowing fathers to beat the gay out of their sons. 


8. Their insecurities with their own feminity. A lot of black women are so insecure with their own feminity, that they will support hatred against men or transgender people who are feminine, because they believe it's taking something from them.","1_1_6_1_1_1_1_1"

Republicans have convinced white evangelicals that all of their problems are caused by the others, that is, anyone who is not white, Christian, and heterosexual in America. The reality is that people who are in the same socio-economic class, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation, have more in common with each other than not. 

Republican politicians focus on driving the message that keeps critical thinking off the table and out of schools. They focus on separating people, highlighting everything that is different, and raising it as a way to drive a wedge between people who really have the same needs and wants for their lives, at the most basic levels. 

Since economics is not taught in elementary, jr.. high, or high school, there is a very large cohort of Americans who never learn this lesson. We dont discuss the concept of opportunity costs (butter v. guns), we dont teach sex education (what is required if you want to have sex and avoid pregnancy and STIs), we dont talk honestly about the facts of American history (Reconstruction, Jim Crow, 1900 to 1960s - why The Great Migration happened and more). It is easier to make people behave like lemmings and not think for themselves if they remain uneducated. And this leads to all of the book bans across the country.

Personally, I am passionate about reading. I cannot imagine my life without Judy Blumes books. She is singlehandedly responsible for me knowing about puberty through Are You There God? Its Me Margaret. No one in my family prepared me for anything and it is absolutely shameful. I know that there are thousands of young girls across the country now, in the same situation, not know what is happening to them or why. My heart breaks for girls who live in states where there are no Judy Blume books on the library shelves and no books on human sexuality to read.","3_2"

Its a myth that Canada has free healthcare, what we have is an entirely PUBLIC health care. Health care system is free here if you pay for it to be free. Its free for asylum seekers and immigrants from developing countries with no money because us citizens have to pay a shit ton of tax for others to have those benefits. Canadians pay more taxes than Americans therefore we have more amenities, so it seems free but trust we paying. Basic health care like staying in the hospital is free&using your taxes, and then medication, ambulance, doctor visits are not covered by the government you need to have insurance or youre paying it out of pocket.

Maybe if youre white here then the healthcare is good but in my experience the individuals working in the system are not smart when it comes to black patients. My dad got diabetes because his doctor did not bother to tell him that he saw in his blood tests that he was pre diabetic and he ignored those tests and my dad was diabetic for 3 months without being aware. 

I was having stomach problems and the doctor told me on several different occasions that I have celiac disease, low iron, lactose intolerance, IBS, without doubt any tests and she made me take medication for all of those conditions when I have none of those. 

My sister has sickle cell and was kept in the hospital for 3 weeks because the doctors didnt know what was going on and they presumed it was pneumonia and it was just her hand hurting from a blood clot&.

After I turned 7 my birth mom moved to Cali with my little sister. 

When I was 9 my mom/great-grandma died suddenly and I was alone with her. A couple years later I was sent to live with my birth mom after she'd had another baby. Shortly therearfter, she decided she wanted to move back to the home state.

We moved back via Greyhound. It's crazy to think now about the fact that 4 people moved across the country with all of their belongings in a cardboard box. Anyway, on the bus my mom sat with the baby and my younger sister and since I was older I had to sit beside a stranger for the three-day journey. 

One evening in the middle of the trip an older woman showed up and sat beside me. I don't remember talking to her until nighttime but I felt really comfortable with her which was not usually the case with new people. It got late and I remember falling asleep with my head on her arm and feeling content in a way I hadn't felt since my mom/great-grandma was alive.

 We actually used to take trips via the bus out to Cali to visit an uncle and his kids, so it was very reminiscent of that. She--the stranger--actually looked and dressed like my mom/great-grandma down to the cat-eye glasses. I don't know if any of y'all remember those polyester pants suits that were popular in the seventies/eighties but she had one of those on also. It was uncanny.

When I woke up she was gone. I asked my birth mom if she'd seen her and noticed the resemblance, she said she didn't see her. It was uncanny.

Whoever she was, I am grateful for her kindness and her presence. It felt like I got another chance to spend time with my mom/great-grandma and as a result, was able to gain closure. It brings me peace whenever I think of that experience.","24"

She asked me if I was ok, if I needed help, or if there was something she could do for me. I told her I wasn't good, but that it wasn't life-threatening, and she gave me a hug. She told me that whatever difficult thing I was facing, it was going to be ok; ""You're young, and life is hard, but you've got this. I know it's gonna be ok for you!""

I thanked her, and we parted ways. The fact that a total stranger comforted me more than some of my own friends still blows my mind, and I hope that wherever she is, she's having a great life.","39"

First, when I was a preteen, a woman saw me trying to brush my hair in a change room and offered me her wide-tooth comb to keep instead. She saw what I had wasn't made for my curls!

Second, a wonderful group of women I'd just met welcomed me to join their band for Carribana and showed me the ropes. Had an absolute blast because of them and how welcoming they were. 

Third, I was part of a wedding party and quickly realized the assigned hair dresser did NOT know what do do with my hair. I was so embarrassed and had to leave the salon to find a Black hairdresser nearby and she saved me and made me look beautiful for the event.

That was two years ago, and until last March, I would go into the cafeteria and she wouldn't take my meal card if it was just her at the desk. She would just let me through for free, and would sneak me whatever extra fruits or snacks from the dining floor. Then another lunch lady started talking to me, and after that, she would give me extra servings of the good food or let me have the fresh baked dessert first before she put it out.  I did a favor for her once, and she always told everyone around her about the time I helped her, I thought it was no big deal but it clearly meant a lot to her.

One food stand lady asked me about my family because I looked familiar to her, and from that conversation, I found out she was a second or third cousin of my grandfather. After that, when I came to her booth, she would give me something extra when I bought snacks or coffee between classes and always called me cuz.

She always had something encouraging for me when I saw her, and she always offered me free food as well.

And yes, in many scenarios there are instances where you can get the a HBCU at the same cost or cheaper than a PWI. 

But there is still a reality that even with this, sometimes PWIs can still be cheaper. I wanted to go to an HBCU for awhiile but went to a top PWI bc I had a full ride since my parents made under a certain amount and we were broke. I felt stuck in that choice. That was me and several people I was in school with and many other PWIs have a higher number of scholarships and grants to give out. And many athletes are in a conundrum bc they have to go to the right program and many of HBCUs have teams that are here today and gone tomorrow. I wanted to go to one and the year I reached out about recruitment, they didnt respond and I realized it was bc they had no team that year. And that terrified me. 

Theres unfortunately a lot of constraints of why people pick the schools they do but youre right, it should be encouraged more for those who it suits. Too many of us think our own schools arent good enough which is not the truth and very self-hating. So I critique more this and other self-hating reasons why ppl dont go to an HBCU rather than the decision in and of itself bc we dont know why someone went to a PWI. PWI doesnt always mean anti-HBCU and I just say this too as someone who is always assumed to be anti-HBCU in HBCU v. PWI debates bc of where I went to school when really I was just poor with a full ride.>7<Ã¾@ When I have kids, I would love for them to go to an HBCU especially bc I know theyll be in a better financial situation than I was. 

sidenote: its also interesting too bc we value the connections that PWIs have which is true.

It was tax breaks/credits if you had an ""affirmative action"" plan and all you had to do was ""prove"" you recruited x amount of minority to get those tax breaks, ie jobs hiring from within but advertising they are hiring just to interview a bunch of BIPOC people who never had a chance, so they can say they fullfilled their targeted recruitment.

Im hope that is not the case because we have finally seen increases in diversity in tech and black women especially are being exceptional in the field. When I was in high school I went to a SAT prep class for underprivileged youth because a big hurdle for black high schoolers is having test scores that are competitive with privileged groups that have had their kids in prep courses since 7th grade. This isnt only about class because many working class Asian families prioritized college prep classes and test scores. While we know that a test is not a good measure of who deserves a college education, its the game we are stuck in. We as a community HAVE to do more to rally together and support black students in any way we can. If these groups can waste tax payer money to bring this to the supreme court then we can play the same game. I know the least I can do is volunteer teach a SAT prep course.","37"

A white w/c boy who does poorly at school still has way more chance of getting an apprenticeship and future employment in traditionally working class professions. 

There aren't many Black people working in construction and associated industries, car manufacturing, the coal and steel industries, etc, hell, even your local cake factory will be 99% white. 

Working class white boys are overrepresented in all the manual trades and service &amp; hospitality industries. A poor academic record doesn't necessarily result in poorer life outcomes for them. 

That report made out like they were victims of BAME success, when that's not the case. That report tl:dr was basically ""white boys are suffering because Black and ME people are too good at what they do."" I doubt one has anything to do with the other. 

And quite frankly, if w/c white boys aren't doing as well in school as w/c BAME pupils, you have to look at why schools &amp; teachers are apparently neglecting them in favour of BAME pupils, and you have to look at the parent(s) and what expectations they have for their sons.

1. On the one hand, Brown v. Board of Education was almost 70 years ago. Did we really still need affirmative action to desegregate schools?
2. As someone who was accepted into multiple university and has multiple degrees with Latin honors, did I only make it this far because of affirmative action and not my own intelligence?

I also had another realization when chatting with a friend. I worked in higher ed for a decade and I saw how there were students who just didn't do well. And the focus wasn't telling students to cut their losses and pursue other opportunities/ come back to college when they're ready. The focus was retaining students. Meaning students who didn't have scholarships (or lost their scholarships because they weren't able to handle the academic rigor) were just taking out tons and tons of loans, even if they weren't doing well at college and even if it would have taken them years to graduate. This to me is disingenuous for universities to do because this is actively exacerbating the wealth gap. We are taking young people and saddling them with debt and most of those people are black.   


I think we're going to start to see more of a economic shift that could be positive. The trades are dying right now because tradesmen are getting older and so many students just go straight to college instead of to apprenticeships. Because there are so many vacancies in the trades, the old boys club is becoming less and less diluted and more women and non white people are apprenticing. If black students aren't getting into college because of affirmative action, they could still enter the trades and make six figure salaries without crippling debt. After they save the salaries, if they want to go to college, they probably could put themselves through with little to no debt. I'm hoping this is a net positive for people and maybe it's a better way to uplift other communities.

Do you think the white kid who got in because their dad was frat brothers with the dean of admissions  is thinking this?

Do you think the kid whose parents were able to spare thousands of dollars for private tutoring says "" did I get in because my parents had the means to support furthering my education or did I get in because of my own intelligence""?.

You have to be an exceptional student to even get past the threshold for these schools. You wouldn't have gotten multiple degrees with honors because of AA. Why are you underestimating yourself?

And sure the debt issue is bad all around, but is simply not going to school the solution to that? The issue surrounding that is much more complex than simply ""don't go to collge"".  [X](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-racial-wealth-gap-financial-aid-and-college-access/) 

And yes the trades are valid jobs and should be encouraged as well, but the ""6 figure salary"" promise is overplayed. Most tradespeople are not going to be making that much. Lifetime earnings for trade jobs is also significantly lower. Not to mention, depending on the type of work, job security is lower, more contract work is involved (which means not required to pay health benefits) also the physical toll that trades work has on people is significant.  A healthy community would have a healthy balance of people in all types of jobs, not just trades. There also needs to be black teachers, politicians, doctors, scientists, urban planners,  policymakers, historians, engineers, etc. Don't underestimate the importance of college education in terms of social mobility in general. This isn't an either-or-situation.","58_1"

But at the same time, if someone is putting themselves in tens of thousands of dollars of debt, delaying their earnings by more than four years (because the average student graduates in 6 years), they are hurting themselves in the long run. Your Brookings institute article pretty much argues that Black families have fewer assets that are not counted (retirement accounts, home equity) when calculating financial aid awards compared to white families. That has nothing to do with whether or not college is a good investment. If anything, it just highlights that accumulating more debt when you have fewer assets is not going to lead to equal opportunities--it could put you further behind.  


Re: trades. I agree that the starting pay for the apprenticeship level of trades is low. But you can start off with that at a very young age and start earning at 19. For the sake of argument, I'll start the apprentice off at $45,000. Someone who goes to college right out of high school, meanwhile, has already taken on $20,000 of debt in one year with no way to pay it back. By the time the college student has finished at 22 (assuming that they can finish at 22), they are $80,000 in debt. The apprentice has earned $180,000 in gross income and has started to either accumulate money in a retirement account or started paying into a pension plan. And even if the apprentice had taken on loans during those 4 years, at least he can discharge his loans in bankruptcy, but the college student couldn't.  


Finally, I absolutely agree that there are specialized careers that require a college degree, but there are so many more that don't. I think unless you are going into a specialized field that requires a degree (like all of the ones you listed), you should go to college. But so many 18 year olds don't know what they want to do, or they want to do something that doesn't actually require a degree, or they just go to college because ""it's the next step."" Those students, in my view, should probably wait and see.  


But back to the purpose of affirmative action. I'd rather see someone get rejected from college when they're not able to succeed in college than to see someone get accepted and fail out after accumulating debt equivalent to a down payment on a house. If someone can't get accepted based on their grades out of high school or test scores or whatever, then they should get up to speed at a community college later and try again. I don't think that letting in a student who may not do well is helpful to that student in the long run. (But then again, who am I to make that call? That's why this is so conflicting for me).","58_1_1"

So, hearing my very good Cauc friend praise him, sent me over the top. This Cauc friend was previously invited to the cookout by all. Anywho, I havent talked to this friend since and i will not. This friend of yours is ignorant to reality, but is set in her thoughts and nothing you do will change that. In evaluating if you should continue this friendship, I would ask if you can handle without too much anger, if she taps back on ""that was a long time ago?"" If she brings up this situation again, will you be fine with her having the feeling that black people are given scholarships they do not deserve? If not, I would fade away. If you are open to talking about it and want to continue the friendship, tell her some facts she may not be aware of, how you feel, and how her statements made you feel in them coming from her of all people.

They expect black women to save them every election, they expect us to lead the stop asian hate movement, they expect us to beg for forgiveness whenever a black person commits a crime against someone of another race, they expect us to march and protest when they won't go out and do the same for their own respective communities, they expect us to take a bullet every time someone ends up on a tshirt. When they don't get the results they want, it's suddenly black women's fault.

I noticed it becoming more prevalent back in the 2010s, when I was still a teen. I could scroll on a YouTube comment section about a dog and his owner and see a random incel comment making it about women and how sad men are somehow. Or straight vitriolic content being pushed in recommends. I chalk this up to everybody and their dusty uncle getting hold of internet service, smartphones, and a podcast mic by the late 2010s and going off on black women on the internet for no reason. And all of the types that do these things are usually miserable and arent living the life they thought they as a man should live but theyd rather blame women (and  even kids they chose to have) than themselves.

It reached such high popularity in the 2020s though. Manosphere incel bullshit was and is everywhere. Black women, despite being such a small %, is always on the tip of peoples unwashed tongues. Even if we dont even interact with them like that! But Im noticing a small shift  I see people calling out their incorrect facts and statements in videos and clapping back in comments. I remember if anyone tried to bring it up back then, they were devoured and called too sensitive and but he has a point! You females need to be held accountable!!!. Now I think a lot of people, especially black women, are over it and Im loving it. The shift is small, but I see a lot of women are not listening to them and their stupid points anymore and are either ignoring them altogether or fighting back. But I think men are also noticing this, and might also feel in their bones that this is the last period of their relevancy so theyre doubling down and going harder on the stupidity online (and in person)& 


as the other commenter said, this might be the final phase before it starts getting better.","6"

(Let e mpreface this, I'm in the US and I don't know if it's international, and it's not all black men. There's just a growing sample)

It's...weird. I don't think it's just ""oh, I'm chronically online,"" either. It's out there, in the real world. It's like I'm seeing a specific emergence of black incels within the community. Like, misogynoir was already rampant in the community, but I'm seeing more and more black men talking from two sides of their mouth. 

The madonna and the whore paradox. You're either too saintly and can't keep a man, or you're a SLOOT for the streets. You're just not ""good enough for (some of) them.""

I'm also seeing WAY more posts about these same incel dudes pushing for other black men to travel to 3rd world countries to find 'real tradwives.' Like, there's nothing wrong with interracial dating, but I feel SORRY for these women who are marrying these egotistical chauvinists. The greencard is NOT worth it, especially with the emotional/financial abuse these dudes are spouting is the ""right way"" on their blogs, videos, and podcasts.

I've also been seeing an uptick of extremely hateful comments. Like it was bad before, but i've recently come across black women and non-blk men couples on IG and tiktok and their comments were SO FULL OF HATE. 

I've also seen black women who document their experiences living abroad and extremely hateful comments from black men telling them they don't belong in X country. I even saw one yesterday on Ig where a young black gal talked about her interest for anime and cosplay and Black men were telling her she's just a fake, the characters aren't blk (so therefore she shouldn't cosplay them) etc. etc. It's not the first time I've seen it, either. 

I also forgot to mention I saw another post where a black woman was talking about raising her biracial children and the nuances that come with race, and black men were attacking her for teaching her child that being biracial still means you have black blood, and that it could impact how authority/law enforcement could treat you. The men in the comments were saying, ""she was part of the problem and she was directly impacting \[their\] biracial children's ability to succeed.""

Now admittedly, some of the accounts could have been folks masquerading as black men, but some of the new-age Andrew Tate-esque talkshows  (some are plain..worse)  and the black men supporting them in the comments can't be fabricated.

I'm gonna say something that maybe isn't right, but I feel black women have had enough trying to uplift the black community and society as a whole at large. We need to stop playing superwoman and take off our capes. We need to stop setting ourselves on fire to keep others warm.

(again gotta stress, interracial relationships are wonderful! But if you have to talk down about your community to complement the other...there's an issue)

I also forgot to mention that I'm also seeing a bit of an uptick in racial rhetoric in the LGBT community, it's nowhere NEAR as large but I am seeing misogynoir cropping up.

 - Individualism: people are fixated on that capitalistic ""you have to *earn* everything"" and view reparations as a handout rather than a policy driven method of addressing centuries of wage theft and exploitation (that itself still won't fully address systemic racism). We're seeing it now in the conversation of student loan cancellations--they are unsustainable amounts of debt and gatekeep a valuable resource in the form of an educated population. Student loan debt elimination would only be harmful to the already wealthiest people in power who can afford the loss and in exchange we'd have a more educated population in less debt when there's a growing demand for more specialized labor. 

 - Willful Ignorance - they ignore the fact that forms of reparations have and do currently exist, but they generally oppose those too.

 - White supremacy - People have tangible benefits from white supremacy (even if it's still ultimately destructive and environmental issues alone will destroy humanity as we hit climate disasters which themselves are also racial and gender issues) but it won't stop beneficiaries from fighting to keep it in power because they stand to gain from maintaining white supremacy. When you're centered in medical research, financial opportunities, employment, entertainment, and every industry imaginable, they're gonna fight tooth and nail to stay in power even if they don't realize that's what they're doing.

 - Racism - Just gonna say it again. People will literally die for their anti-blackness and will happily harm themselves to that end if it they know it hurts someone else more.","6"

The Japanese and Jews recieved reparations in ""short order"" after the atrocities. Please bear in mind this is me listing their reasoning not my own. No enslaved person is alive today. Because these people do not truly understand the scale of the crimes against Black people, and they have never truly considered the long lasting effects, they cannot see how reparations are necessary. As you said, they view things like affirmative action as going ""above and beyond"" and a form of positive discrimination. They genuinely believe that since the end of *de jure* discrimination **every black person born has had the same rights (technically true by law) as any other group and therefore the same chance at success (definitely untrue).** It then follows that since it is true that no black person today was enslaved, and since they also had ""extra rights"" in affirmative action, that they do not deserve further compensation.

Of course, if we talked about reparations for Jim Crow and segregation, something that is, I think in the minds of black people folded into the slavery reparations issue but generally overlooked by others, I'd be interested to see what they say, since arguably many thousands of people today would have gone through that system and deserve compensation for discrimination. The problem though is that rather than it being a camp where named individuals were interned or murdered it was a prevailing system that targeted ""black people."" The courts have been unsurprisingly reticent to rule on things like racial bias even when proven to affect one group more than another (New Jim Crow). Who knows what they'd make of Jim Crow reparations seeing as they're more explicit than today's racial bias but still not ""specific"" enough to perhaps name specific instances of damage.","15"

Are White Americans, descended of Black American slaves, included in this?

What about black families that received their 40 acres and mule from the government,  (and got to keep it) are their descendants eligible for reparations?

Because guilt can't be inherited. There is no reason a white person today has to pay for the crimes of the past, nor that a descendant of a slave should be compensated for not having undergone these atrocities.

""There are still repercussions of slavery to this day""

That's why we should strive towards equal opportunities rather than reparations. Better public schooling, healthcare etc across the board. Not just for specific minority groups, but the disadvantaged in general. The poor white/hispanic/asian should get the same opportunities as the people held back due to a past of slavery or any other reason that put them 'behind' beyond their control.","39"

- No person alive today was a slave. It would have made more sense to pay living victims like how Jews were after WW2

- Most people come from families that played no part in slavery, whether because they were not rich planters, from the north, or immigrated after the civil war. Why should they have to pay from their taxes?

- How would such a policy work? Do mixed raced people get a smaller percentage than more black people? Are you trying to pay haitian and nigerians, because that isnt fair as they are recent immigrants. Do Oprah and Lebron get full payments despite being uber rich? If poverty alleviation is the goal, it would be better to make it income based so that poor people of any race can benefit. 

- And then we get to what reparations would even look like. One time cash payments, or annual checks like some sort of dividend? I dont think most people would buy into that.","40"

First, he's truly a thoughtless flake and had no respect for your time. He just didn't care that there was a set time to do something pretty integral to the opening stage of dating someone with the intentions of a relationship. It paints a bad picture of someone who might mean well but their priorities are out of wack, they're self centered and disorganized-- this person is also fashionably late to everything. Even their own mother's funeral type shit. The female equivalent of this knows the group wants to see a movie at 7:15 but at 7:10 everyone's pissed off because they can't just leave her and she's only half done with her makeup and its already been 45 minutes. I had a friend like this. The respect for other people's time was non-existent. She also changed boyfriends like socks. Shocker, I know.

Second, he's a crypto-chauvinist and wannabe player who thinks correctly prioritizing plans with a woman will make him look like a simp. This is the dude who's pride, insecurity and deep seated misogyny means that he will break his neck to find a way to let you know you're not a priority. I've even seen red pillers and PUAs swear on everything that you shouldn't show up on time to appointments with women because it'll make them look submissive and well trained. Its supposed to let the rest of us know that they are way more important than us and won't bend their schedule to our whims even if they themselves set the time agreed upon. Domestic abusers are known to purposefully show up hours later than a promised time so they can feel in control and dominant.

Third option, it was truly an unintentional goof and bruh forgot to hit the store. If he didn't, he wouldn't have eaten tonight or the rest of the week. He's probably bummed or even angry that the result is a deleted number and being cut off. BUT, that doesn't make you wrong. Maybe for the next woman he'll have his shit together and not end up in a situation like this where he looks like a flake.

I actually don't think its option 3 because if it was, he would have said ""Yes, I'm so sorry I'm running late but I forgot to go to the store. Mind giving me another half hour just to get shopping done? Something came up, but I'll be happy to give you my attention soon"". Instead he gave a half assed apology and tried to combine his errand with your virtual date and only give you half of his attention. That's insulting and it's a small but noticeable red flag.

So, I'm putting money on option one: he's a thoughtless flake. Good riddance to him.","3"

When he was 40 min late I called and asked where he was, and he was allegedly still on his merry way. After waiting an hour and a half for this guy to show up, I told him to go home. He didn't know I needed to be in bed early that night, but that's not the point. He knew I was waiting on him and spent over an hour saying he was on his way each time I asked, when I knew he only lived 20 mins away. Either they know how to treat you with respect, or they don't.

There is power in having boundaries and standing up for yourself as a woman. 

I can think of so many situations in the past when dating someone that I let shit slide just because I thought it wasnt that big of a deal. Instead, I shouldve realised those were red flags and a good indicator of negative traits. I used to date a guy who could barely respond to my messages on time. Hours or even days would go by. I just dismissed it as, as long as everything is fine when were together it doesnt matter how long he takes to respond. We lasted for a few months but the same shit I ignored in the beginning was the same thing I ended up breaking up with him for. Got to the point where I was frustrated daily because my own boyfriend was increasingly difficult to get in contact with.

I mentioned this ages ago but a former friend was acting funny with me because trying to get with this girl, right? We had made some plans for his birthday months in advance. On the day of, he snubbed me and I never heard from him after he had told me a few days before that he would let me know. That was pretty much it for me, because he didn't respect my time and was fine with wasting it. I never got an explanation or an apology either, so I took things for what they were and let the friendship die.

My husbands culture tends to be time flexible. There's a technical term for it I learned in school, but I cant recall. People show up late for *everything*. Weddings, birthdays, dates, dinner. 

The upper classes are more timely since they tend to work in offices, but your average person in the village or middle-class parts of the cities are just *not* timely. If a merchant told you your furniture would be ready this Tuesday, they probably wont have it done until next Friday (if youre lucky). Yes, youll have to keep checking in. *In-person*. Do not expect them to track you down and let you know. >7<Ã½@

My husband had a habit of showing up late early on in our relationship. I was mad. I expressed that. He switched up pretty fast when he realized I was upset (though I could tell he was a bit confused about why I was hurt that he was 20 minutes late). In the end, it was a great opportunity for us to learn about each other.

As I became more secure in our relationship and experienced the many valuable ways he demonstrates his love and affection (which I wont list because this comment is already long), I became more flexible. Were back to a more casual conception of time and plans. I let him know if its time important, but time doesn't factor into our day-to-day interactions.

My bestie is a brother who isnt timely at all. If you have plans for 10 am, hes not leaving the house until 10 am. But hes a loyal and compassionate friend.

I can hit him up right now and say, Can I hold $50? and he wouldnt ask why (and he isnt loaded). He wont get upset if I dont offer to pay it back in three days. Hell hit me up when he needs it with no bitterness (But obviously, as part of honoring our friendship I usually get back to him first). I can call him any time of the day if Im upset and rant for an *hour*. Hell drop whatever hes doing 70% of the time.

Sometimes Ill text him, Hey I made food and have extra, come get you a plate? Despite making plans for that evening you may not hear from him again until tomorrow if you dont poke him. Sometimes my husband and I will eat it after a day if we get hungry. And bestie is not offended by that. Because he *knows* theyll be meal invites in the future.

Bestie is flexible so last-minute changes arent a big deal. Ofc, I keep them to a minimum. But hes a great person to have around when you pass a peach farmer on the side of the road and want to stop. Bestie is *never* in a rush. He has liberating easygoing fun energy. You cant know the beauty of it until youve experienced it. We got a weird mutual understanding unique to our dynamic.

If I let him know certain things are time-sensitive (like an appointment), hell be on time. Like my husband, I just have to make it *clear*. 

Some of my other friends are way more peculiar about time, so I respect that. I know X will be here no later than 1:02 pm and so I match that energy.

Each relationship has different rules. I adjust for neuroticism from my strict companions and I give leeway to my bohemian buddies because everyone brings something unique to the table outside of that.

New people being late used to trigger feelings of abandonment in me. My mother (who I didnt see much of for a while due to circumstances) was late for *everything*. Even picking me from school. Which could be scary. I was too tough to admit (to myself or her) that I was terrified of being forgotten. So Id just get passive-aggressive and testy towards her when she did show up. Wed get to scraping and no one even really knew what started it. >&<Ã¾@

It took years to realize that I was reacting towards others who were *not* my mother from a place of hurt. The relationship would usually be permanently soured on my end. I stayed feeling sore and abandoned. =

Thank you so much for understanding what I was trying to say and for giving this beautiful story as an analogy. I am a bit like your friend and I love in New Orleans and have been in the south all my life, everything is lax. So I guess thats why I didnt get it and was so curious about that and man I could delete numbers all I want but Ill run into that person over and over since its small here lol. So you kinda get past things fast. I had to put that into perspective too.

I love the example you gave about folks who work on schedules and family trauma around folks being late or not showing up at all. That can activate an anxious response and thats something we have to look at in ourselves. By no means should we be a pushover around our boundaries, but we can miss out on some beautiful people if we dont see whats behind our reactions. It takes time, I think. Im almost 40 and still learning.

This is core to understanding the false equivalency that comes from ""colorblind"" ideology. It is something that all sides of the political specturm(liberal, progressive, conservative, etc) adopt selectively. People with colorblind ideology think having anything attributed to race is negative because they are projecting from when things were attributed to whites at the detriment of non-whites. Thus they say things like race doesn't matter. Or that we shouldn't have institutions based off of *skin color*. They have internalized a literal interpretation of ""Seeing color"""". They fail to realize that ""black"" refers to more than just *skin color*, but an actual distinct culture of people which are part of the national identity all the same.

They then say ""well what if whites made things based off their own culture"", not realizing that mainstream society and that very concept are one in the same. They have convinced themselves that society is colorblind and ethnically agnostic across the board which leads to a lot of cognitive dissonance when addressing topics of race. They also seem to think things like HBCUs are exclusionary to them which is another form of projection.

HBCUs were unique in that they didn't restrict admissions based on race and so by definition were open to everybody(including whites) and the main nonwhite population at the time were blacks. They were always open to everybody and still are. The name even says ""historically black""(merely referring to a the *unique* existence of a university where blacks where actually allowed to attend) but is instead interpreted through projection/false-equivalency goggles as ""black only both in the past in the present"", when neither of the two were/are true at all.

If someone was born into a well-off or at least comfortable family, with parents who knew how to navigate parent-teacher meetings, standardized exams, and college admissions, where they didn't have to work to support their family, with no abuse happening at home, with an ethnicity that people tend to encourage academically instead of discourage, and access to the best schools and extracurriculars from a young age, did that person really get admitted on merit? Or did they win the birth lottery? 

I say this as someone with a lot of those privileges myself, people thinking that they're succeeding because they're excellent when they're actually playing life on easy mode annoy me. A lot of those same people lose their minds when faced with hardship, failure, or structure that isn't provided for them because they've never had to deal with that. Where's the merit in that? I guarantee that most of them haven't worked as hard as the kid who's trying to get good grades while also dealing with racist teachers and trying to make sure their family can pay their rent. I saw another comment about the massive amount of cheating (and nepotism) that goes on, which is true. Is that also merit? I hope colleges start admitting people who can demonstrate resilience, critical thinking, and creativity. A lot of the ""merit"" admissions lack that because all they know how to do is memorize facts, follow a path that someone else set out for them, and demand what they feel they're entitled to despite not earning it.

You'd be surprised how much you'd value a doctor who can care for you instead of just assuming they know everything when you walk in with a rare disease. There are so many shit doctors out here. You want a doctor who had to decide to do this. 

I'm tentatively hopeful that schools will choose other aspects to focus on, like income, which as a rich black person, makes more sense to me. Sure I was discriminated against at PWI but at least I could get into the best schools in my state at an early age. But I also know that in this country, if you don't enforce a federal standard, our shittiest states will inconvenience their citizens just because they can. So this will likely be another loss for our red state sisters.

The worst part is this was orchestrated by white people. They're trying to make minorities fight over affirmative action while legacy admissions still overwhelming favor white people.

You recommend the book only for them to turn it down. You beg and plead with them to read it but they just say, ""nah"".

I thought about the Sanchez name, too, for a while... but his daughter is apparently the basic definition of white girl with blonde hair.  I mean, in one of the new (leaked) episodes, there is even a reference to Beth getting re-married in some universes, to a Jewish guy.  Even ""The Artist Formerly Known As Rick"" still has the gray skin-tone of all the Ricks (except the green lizard Ricks, I guess?)  All in all, it doesn't really make sense.

I mean, I would bring this up to Justin Roiland over twitter, but I'd really rather not deal with the kind of response I'm pretty fucking positive I would get.  I mean, Roiland is brilliantly funny, but I also highly suspect he is kind of a dick, as are the people who follow him on twitter, likely.

Also, seeing as how its Rick &amp; Morty, even if they *did* address it, it would be one of those Rick meta-commentaries riffing on the social reasons for it happening to begin with or something.  With that kind of mocking tone he does, you know?

However, as long as there is more of Mrs. Pancakes and Mr. Goldenfold, I think I will be okay.  Especially Goldenfold.","8_2_1"

Sort of.

Yeah, Steven Universe is a terrible, godawful creation.  ;)

Connie is Sri Lankan-American, not Japanese. They even drew her fighting style based on that of a martial art straight from her culture, Angampora.  This I think matters so much to the little Sri Lankan girls who have never seen a person of their background in American entertainment media before.

Nearly every voiceover actor you hear is a person of color.

Steven Universe is great for a good number of reasons, including thoughtful diversity (I don't just mean races, but perspectives, personalities, and the mature ways those are dealt with in the show, teaching kids to do the same), intricate and meaningful worldbuilding, and a good heart at the center of it all.

It's earnest in a way that's intelligent instead of cloying.

This show gives me the same feeling that the muppets in all the various shows they appear in did when I was kid, in that it has so many good messages without talking down to young people.

 It feels instantly timeless and it also appeals to adults without diminishing it's actual target, who are kids.  

Yes, everything about Steven Universe is fantastic.  ","10"

I'm planning to figure out a good news outlet to support, and may start some kind of website.

I had the thought, that, for our mental health, the Tower of Light meditation can be extremely helpful. It's from a super New Age book titled [Psychic Self-Defense](https://books.google.com/books?id=bLXB4XN-vDIC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;dq=psychic+self-defense:+strengthen+your+aura&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZkpqU2qPQAhULjVQKHejxAlEQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=psychic%20self-defense%3A%20strengthen%20your%20aura&amp;f=false)--which, yeah, sounds woo-woo, BUT--it has you visualize your highest values and ideals forming a ""shield of spiritual protection"" around you, which I found very helpful at a time when I was recovering from severe depression.

As I just found out that I couldn't walk into a strange Starbucks without the mental safety calculations overwhelming me to the point of tears, I plan to start doing this every day:

The Tower of Light (Regular Method)

1. Breathe deeply and evenly (keep this up throughout the practice).
2. Progressively relax your whole body. (You could use the [Creative Plan of Relaxation](https://books.google.com/books?id=EbuUMal7geoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;lpg=PR7&amp;dq=creative+plan+of+relaxation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TnKMJTZpjE&amp;sig=qP4YqXJRUfbMNSrI30dcSMRZeGY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH-NSw2aPQAhVKy1QKHfPDB5wQ6AEILjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=creative%20plan%20of%20relaxation&amp;f=false), but sometimes a briefer method may suffice). 
3. Stand erect without stiffness, arms at sides. (In making practical use of this method, you may not always find it possible or reasonable to stand. If you are walking, walk upright, evenly, calmly, arms swinging loosely at the sides. If you are seated, sit with spine erect, feet parallel and firmly planted, hands palm down on the thighs. In either case, proceed with what follows just as if you were standing. But when doing your customary practice you should always stand, unless prevented by serious health reasons).
4. Visualize all about you a long ellipsoid of intense bright blue light. It extends about nine inches beyond the surface of your body all around, and to about sixteen inches above your head and below floor level at your feet. (Your psychic aura is much more extensive than that, and is usually visualized in silver; but for defense purposes you need it to be blue, and it is easier to create the conditions you need in this smaller compass.)
5. When you can visualize (or simply be aware of) this well-defined field of intense bright blue light entirely surrounding you, visualize within the summit of that aura, slightly above but not touching your head, a globe of brilliant white light. 
6. Concentrate your attention on this globe, so that it becomes brighter, glowing white like burning magnesium. (You do not need to look upwards, just sense its presence.) Your are making this image to represent the light of your higher self, which is truly there; and you imagine this globe above your head, not touching, because you do not in any way identify your higher self with your conscious self, your ego-personality. 
7. Be aware of these two images: the intense bright blue ellipsoid in which you are entierly contained, and the effulgent white globe over your heaad, occupying the apex of the auric shape. 
8. Aware of the brilliant globe over your head, aspire to the highest good you are capable of conceiving; realizing, though this globe is a visualized symbol, it represents a part of true divine force.
9. When you feel ready, see that dazzling globe sending down glittering white light. This light, filled with silver sparkles, floods your aura and at the same time completely permeates you, coursing vibrantly through you. 
10. The outer shell of your aura remains sharply defined as an ellipsoid of intense bright blue, all filled now with the living, vibrant, sparkling, white light. 
11. Continue this formulation for some time (as long as you can effectively concentrate upon it) seeing it as a living, moving reality. The brilliance flows down continually into you and around you--it is inexhaustible, for it is a part of the source of all and in your aura it continually circulates, effulgent and sparkling, reinforcing that hard, sharply defined and brilliantly blue outer shell. Be aware of yourself, blissful and alert at the center of this glorious manifestation of diving power. Let the globe fade from your consciousness, knowing at the same time that it has not faded from reality.

If you are threatened in public:

The Tower of Light (Emergency Method)

1. Visualize at once the auric ellipsoid of intense bright blue around you, and, within its apex, just above your head, the brilliant white sphere of the light of your higher self.
2. Aware of the brilliant globe over your head, aspire to the highest good you are capable of conceiving; realizing, though this globe is a visualized symbol, it represents a part of true divine force. 
3. See that dazzling sphere sending down a glittering white light. This light, filled with silver sparkles, floods your aura and at the same time completely permeates you, coursing vibrantly through you. See the sharp blue outline of your aura's hard protective shell.
4. Keep this visualization for as long as the need lasts or as long as you reasonably can.

I have also found myself reciting the 23rd Psalm, and the Serenity Prayer, if you are into prayer. 

I pray for your safety, as I'm certain some of you are out there protesting in places that are nowhere near as safe as my very blue city.","1"

The other issue is the relative level of each course that contributes to GPA. A 4.0 for a student taking all honors or AP level math, social studies, science, art, etc. Is very different from a 4.0  in standard level courses.

They are pushing the belief that both us and latino people not only dont deserve to be in the same institution as them but that we are also taking spots meant for them. And judging by this quote from the article they already make up a large portion of the student population. 

Asian-Americans make up a quarter of the entire population, the second-largest share of all races reflected in the survey.

Now personally I dont know what will happen if AA is removed, however the issue is the ideology behind this case. Its the racist beliefs towards black and latino people and the blame white people are escaping for their discrimination. Its treating minority groups as if were exchangable instead of real people who all  work hard under this system against us. The saddest part out of all of this is that racist white people are gonna eat this infighting between minorities up.","3_3_2"

Reversing the races in this statement wouldnt change the statements truth. 

I really believe uniting is the only way to dismantle the kinds of systems that harm us all, but that as long as people like that sabotage other POC groups and fall for the same kinds of in-fighting that the US instigates in other nations... were stalled on progress, constantly.

Moving the meter on their bigotry would be nice, but isnt necessarily necessary to turn people like that. I think that if they can be made to understand that this kind of action against other POC groups translates to or concludes itself as an action against their own, anyone strategically-minded enough to do damage on this scale in the name of their own (as opposed to for their own name) would at a minimum want their impact on other POC groups to be neutral.

I understand how you feel. I look at it like this. If you have to explain your humanity to people as people look on in fascination, then you don't need anybody like that in your life because they imply they don't see you as human and it fascinates them to watch you try to convince them of your humanity like its a fucking college level debate competition or something. 

Fuck them. Fuck their chimpouts, fuck their dry snitching ass slurs they have for us. Fuck their varying attempts to have demeaning conversations with us, fuck their projections, fuck their fake attempts to empathise by wanting to be mammied by us, fuck their mediocre, bland attempts to copy us (r blackpeopletwitter, cough cough) fuck their reverse racism, and most of all, fuck their feelings (aka downvotes).

Yes. I'm tired too. I'm so fucking tired, and that's what brought me to this point. Keep doing you. I've learned to just take mental notes when talking to them. Keep reading, studying and learning. Watch the patterns and listen to what they say. Read them. And after that, nothing they say will matter all that much to you. And when they do something, always call it out. Call out all fuckery and use your poker face while doing it. They won't be able to say shit back to you. Be non responsive when you do it. Observe your surroundings, and always make sure you laugh whenever you can.

I went shopping some months ago and while I was getting eggs, a very small White child was nearby. The father saw me, and he hurried up and called his child and told him to ""come here"".

Show them some respect, and choose not to let some racist assholes stop you from living up to your destiny.**   

**All of this intellectual discourse sparked by political and systematic racism is nothing more than a sad but effective ploy to prevent any sane, logical black man or woman from living the dream. Don't fall into the trap. Live your life, and fuck the rest.**

Constantly shouts (often quite literally) over me and everyone else when having discussions of race or other social justice issues. Even when theyre not situations that require shouting. Someone (white person) asked me if it would be racist to dress as a stereotype of another (white, historically marginalized culture. Think like trying to represent a Jewish person by wearing a big nose and yarmulke and holding a money bag). I open my mouth to share my thoughts and Ms Performative Ally interrupts to declare that white people dont experience racism and looks to me for validation. Like okay, but clearly in context, we are using racism as shorthand for ethnic bigotry and even so, maybe *screaming* over the black women whom the question was directed to isnt the appropriate response. 

Every potentially serious conversation goes like this with her. Ill start a sentence and shell literally shout to finish the sentence with some shit she learned from Tik tok or Twitter. Like no, thats not what I was going to say at all. I actually have both experience and academic knowledge of these topics, whatever I have to say about them isnt going to be performative outrage memes about gatekeeping girlbosses or melanin poppin or its just a social construct. 

Then the few times I actually dont get interrupted, and I disagree with/have a more nuanced view on whatever is trending on social media, she gawps and says but [such and such unverified Twitter account] said xyz. Girl, you dont even know if that is a real black person, much less that theyre an adult with any education or expertise. That could easily be a white teenager in Belarus stirring shit up (and sometimes it literally is. People lie on the internet all the time). Dont be posting listen to women of color memes when you dont wanna listen to the black women who are sitting right in front of your face. 

Shes also constantly sniping at people with degrees at relevant times, as if somehow, having a degree removes information from your brain. I dont know that its personally targeted, but it sure feels at times like its an attempt to smack down or dismiss the things I say as out of touch or uppity in comparison to whatever people absorb from Twitter.","4"

They just only value us being seen, inspired, and given equal opportunity when it serves their ends and their safety/comfort, not ours:

In a footnote, Chief Justice Roberts exempted military academies from the ruling in light of the potentially distinct interests they present. There had been discussion of whether the military needed to maintain affirmative action in training its future officer corps based on a judgment that it would be bad for military discipline and cohesiveness if the leadership cadre did not reflect the diversity of the rank-and-file troops who do the bulk of fighting and dying in wars

&

Justices Sotomayor and Jackson both criticized the majority for making an exception for military academies. Justice Sotomayor called it arbitrary, while Justice Jackson wrote, The court has come to rest on the bottom-line conclusion that racial diversity in higher education is only worth potentially preserving insofar as it might be needed to prepare Black Americans and other underrepresented minorities for success in the bunker, not the boardroom (a particularly awkward place to land, in light of the history the majority opts to ignore).

Its obviously not what she really wants. Songs like WAP, in my opinion, only proves that bw sexualities cannot actually be expressed, unless its by displaying the Jezebel stereotype placed on to us.

Yes. ""Not exactly"" is a very diplomatic phrase for it. :)

&gt; Have you ever noticed that bw who make this kind of music almost always openly say they dont actually live these lifestyles. 

It's almost like the performers (and their marketing teams) know that once people are distracted, they really aren't paying attention to the details. Almost as if this is a formula that has been successfully used for decades, and almost certainly far longer.

&gt; There is a lot of conversation about reclaiming these stereotypes, which makes no sense.

Yes. It makes no sense whatsoever. The stereotypes would need alternatives before they could be ""reclaimed"",  in the sense that a person could say, ""the stereotype means something else when I reclaim it"". To the average white person, those stereotypes have no alternative, and so unsurprisingly, the imagery only reinforces itself without any turn toward meaningful ""reclamation"".

Yes. [It's a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5Qu6i2EAUY) that I kind of wish everyone would have watched as many times as they watched WAP (especially since Cardi B. is in both, but only one video challenges bad old stereotypes about black women and sex work -- as well as equally bad new notions that sex work is a form of ""empowerment"").

It's ironic how the more thoughtful video (hint: not WAP) was actually created by a black woman who is a sex worker herself, but somehow is not trapped by misogynistic tropes and racist stereotypes. :)

Have you ever considered going to community college and transferring to a 4yr college, then to law school? 

I have a number of friends who actually started their journey to law school at a community college then they transferred to a 4yr and ended up going to some pretty decent law schools (UCLA, NYU, Emory) they're all from California tho and transferred from community colleges here.( I'm not sure if that makes a difference at all.)
One of those friends, wasn't academically ready when they started out in community college and had to take remedial classes to become college ready. Despite this, they recently passed the Feb California Bar with a 32.5% pass rate.  

Law school is challenging, but some schools are pretty supportive of their students and even have accomodations for students who have learning differences. 

I just wanted to share that there are other ways to get there. Not everyone starts out with a strong GPA/SAT scores out of highschool directly to a 4yr.","11_1"

My advice to everyone whose law applications I've read has always been to emphasize your narrative voice.
