&gt;Huddled for a lengthy meeting with his legal advisers, Trump was warned the pardons he once hoped to bestow upon his family and even himself would place him in a legally perilous position, convey the appearance of guilt and potentially make him more vulnerable to reprisals.

&gt;So, too, was Trump warned that pardons for Republican lawmakers who had sought them for their role in the Capitol insurrection would anger the very Senate Republicans who will determine his fate in an upcoming impeachment trial.

&gt;White House counsel Pat Cipollone and another attorney who represented Trump in his first impeachment trial, Eric Herschmann, offered the grave warnings as Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner listened. Other lawyers joined by telephone. They all told Trump he should not pardon himself, his family or any GOP lawmakers in a prospective manner unless he was prepared to list specific crimes.

What sort of extra vulnerability are they talking about? I know federal pardons do not cover state level acts (and that NY, for instance, has amended their laws to allow them to charge federally pardoned individuals if those crimes violated NY state law), but I'm really wondering what sort of scenarios or issues they laid out sufficient to stay Trump's hand.

I just had two questions that I was hoping someone could clarify since IANAL.

1. I understand the contestants submitted their evidence in a sealed file presented to the judge, is this how these types of cases usually operate? Furthermore was there anything preventing them from releasing this evidence to the media after the case was dismissed? 
Just seems to me based on the hearing that this lawyer was involved in a few weeks later that he would want his smoking gun shown to the public. (He didnt present his evidence at that meeting either, just the conclusion that the evidence brought him to.

2. Page 13 goes over the defendants evidence and for each witness it states the testimony is credible due to XXs experience, lack of bias, and knowledge of the subject...
My question is what goes into the courts determing of a lack of bias? Doesnt being called as a witness for the defense in it self imply a possible bias? Could the contestant ask them who they voted for and if the answer is Biden wouldnt that imply a possible bias?

During the speech preceding the Capitol invasion, Giuliani said, *""send it back to the legislators, give them five to 10 days to finally finish the work""* and later *""we need two days to establish that"".*   

While Congress was in recess after the invasion, Giuliani tried to call Senator Tuberville but mistakenly called Senator Lee and left the following voicemail:

&gt;*Senator Tuberville? Or I should say Coach Tuberville. This is  Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer. I'm calling you because I want to  discuss with you how they're trying to rush this hearing and how we  need you, our Republican friends, to try to just slow it down so we can  get these legislatures to get more information to you. And I know  they're reconvening at 8 tonight, but it &*  ***the only strategy we can  follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get  ourselves into tomorrowideally until the end of tomorrow.***   
&gt;  
&gt;*I  know McConnell is doing everything he can to rush it, which is kind of a  kick in the head because it's one thing to oppose us, it's another  thing not to give us a fair opportunity to contest it. And he wants to  try to get it down to only three states that we contest. But there are  10 states that we contest, not three. So if you could object to every  state and, along with a congressman, get a hearing for every state, I  know we would delay you a lot, but* ***it would give us the opportunity to  get the legislators who are very, very close to pulling their vote****,  particularly after what McConnell did today. It angered them, because  they have written letters asking that you guys adjourn and send them  back the questionable ones and they'll fix them up.* 

It was reported that Trump actually did get through to Tuberville while the invasion was happening and asked him to object to additional states and delay the count so they could ""send it back to the legislatures"".  Then as Congress reconvened, Trump called additional Republican Senators asking them just delay things by another day or two.

None of this makes much sense, though.  Objecting to 3, 6 or even 10 states delays the process by hours not by days.  That's where the Capitol invasion comes in, predominantly as a delay tactic.  However, assuming it succeeded in delaying the count by a day or two or even five, what was that supposed to accomplish?  At the end of the day, the GOP didn't have the votes in the House to sustain the objections even if somehow Trump managed to convince the state legislatures to send alternate slates (which I can't see how they'd have the legal ability to do that so late in the game).  What am I missing?","13_2"

- Giuliani misintepreted Wednesday for Thursday, so ""getting to the end of tomorrow"" would have gotten them to the weekend? So a few extra days on top?

- Giuliani talks a big game about ""state legislators"", but I think it was all a fantasy. There were no state legislatures who were going to do anything, and there was nothing they could do. I don't know if this is Giuliani's delusion, Trump's delusion, or Giuliani's grift. I think they've been talking to individual, crazy state legislators - maybe those conversations gave them some false confidence? Remember that Giuliani came out with some nonsense a few weeks ago about Arizona legislators on the cusp of voting to withdraw their electors or some such, but in actuality less than half of the Arizona R legislators had signed some non-binding, meaningless document while the legislature wasn't in session and even they disputed Giuliani's interpretation. Him and Navarro have been deep in some delusional conversations with state legislators as far as I can tell. Or maybe Giuliani just wanted to delay the inevitable because that gets him points with his boss. 

- Even if not particularly sensical as far as what they hoped to gain by delay beyond limited PR victory, it certainly suggests intent. Giuliani / Trump wanted to interrupt the counting of votes because they thought they would gain something from it.

It's very hard to differentiate Trump from his crazed enablers, and delusion from grift. But either way, delay would have achieved nothing.

Remember, the day before and during the rally itself, Trump had been pushing the newest 'Stupid Plan,' which was to say the idea that Pence could just, you know, send the electoral votes *back,* something that Pence most assuredly did *not* have the authority to do.

According to Trump, *all* Pence had to do with something he absolutely couldn't do, and 'WE WIN!' The only thing the VP needed was courage!

The people gathered at that rally had been fed a steady diet of three things from Trump

1) This latest *super patriotic* plan is going to be the thing that will totally turn the election results around!
2) If it *doesn't* turn the election results around, the country will fall to 'socialist communist Marxists' (which, at that point, is really just stringing scary words together,) and America will be destroyed.
3) That probably won't happen though, because again, *Plan Patriot is totally going to work this time.*

Every time they lost the court case, every time an election official refused to entertain their newest bout of political pressuring, Trump doubled down on those three talking points. The goalpost got moved, and Trump continued to escalate how incredibly super crucial to the country's very survival it was that he remain President. He tried to gaslight the fuck out of people with his election fraud conspiracy, claiming it was a totally proven, factually solid, inescapable truth that 'everyone knew' even as judges across multiple States made it clear that he had dick all.

All of which culminated in his scheme involving Mike Pence, and the thing about that one is there is literally *no excuse* for it. Pence, for obvious reasons of self-preservation, would have made it abundantly fucking clear that he wouldn't have been able to just ditch election law in order to make Trump the winner. 

And yet Trump pushed it to his followers anyway, reinforcing the assertion during the rally that came mere hours before the storming of the Capitol. He championed a tactic whose *own lynchpin told him couldn't be done.*

He then directed the thoroughly riled up mob he had formented to the Capitol, at which point he apparently just kind of ditched them and went back home to watch it on the news. Jesus Christ, even as the mob had gotten so clearly out of hand that Pence was being evacuated, Trump's initial input on Twitter was to castigate *Pence* for betraying him. 

His first actual Twitter push back advising the angry mob storming the Capitol 'remain' peaceful didn't materialize for another 14 minutes. The second Tweet 25 minutes after that, and when he finally released a one-minute video calling for peace, (about an hour after he had made his second tweet,) he spent half of it complaining about how the election had totally been stolen from him, *justifying the fire he was supposedly trying to put out.*

Again, others have already pointed out his use of language during the Save America rally itself was far more combative than it was conciliatory, but the entire situation *he deliberately* concocted was rife with the potential for violence. At this point the only possible defense here outside of malicious intent seems to be that Trump is just too stupid or irresponsible to see where the course he had intentionally charted was *inevitably* leading.

We just had the sitting executive of one branch of our government organize and orchestrate an attack on another branch of our government in an explicit attempt to hold on to power - no matter how deranged or unlikely to succeed it may have been. He used his platform as executive, his political power, and explicitly the power of his office to foster, aid, and execute this attack. He was furthermore unrepentant.

If there are not dire consequences for that, we do not function under rule of law. I do not fucking care what your political leanings are or what you think the political fallout of this is - he unequivocally must be impeached. If senators want to go on record supporting and covering up for a coup attempt, then we can deal with that when we get there. But he must be impeached - not only as punishment for his clear crimes, but to show that we are a country of laws and to send a message to future holders of the office THAT YOU CAN'T OVERTHROW THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT. And likewise, doing this provides an opportunity to ensure that he never holds office again - something that is critical for the future of American democracy.

As to your weak claims about the timing and just running out the clock - Trump still retains his platform, political power, and the power of his office. Things he used to attempt to overthrow the government just two days ago. He shouldn't have his hands on that power for a second longer. I do not want to know what a Donald Trump with absolutely nothing to lose might do in his last two weeks in office. 

So fuck your talk of ""uncompromising babies"", your argument is a marginal and nebulous argument seemingly centered in political expediency. First, this isn't about political expediency, HE MUST BE IMPEACHED - as punishment for his crimes, protection from his abuse of power in the future if ever he gains office again, and to remove him from the instruments of power he has abused (e.g., preventing him from pardoning himself or his co-conspirators). Second, I don't know why you think this damages the political positioning of the Democrats? The majority of the country supports it, their voters obviously support it, success or failure would be an electoral weapon, and the opportunity to end the Trump threat here and now is in their interests even if difficult to achieve.","27_3"

But the President committing a bunch of crimes, particularly when some of those crimes are against the state itself, it would be incompatible with Article II, Section 3. (""he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"") 

The pardon power is the only power (I think?) the founders took from the monarchy. But the way they envisioned it used was for things like instances of clemency where someone ends up a political prisoner because national zeitgeist demands it or pardoning participants in armed rebellion that might let life go back to normal if they felt like they weren't going to die if they surrendered. ([Federalist 74](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed74.asp))

Some people disagree with this take. (I believe Posner disagrees with me) If you read just the naked text of the pardon powers with blinders on to the rest of the Constitution or history then you could arrive at a different answer. 

That said, imagine a hypothetical and remove current situations from your mind: the President of the United States decides he's over dealing with Congress. They suck and it sucks to suck. So he gets a rag tag group of supporters and tells them specifically to go to the Capitol and kill them all. They succeed in killing a few, but not all, and President Psycho kills a law maker himself on live TV. 

The coup fails though. And order is eventually restored. President Psycho Pardons himself. Will a court ever agree that the breadth of the pardon power allows such a thing? 

No. Will a court ever grant a President with a more grey set of circumstances requesting relief that would pave the way for President Psycho to get what he wants? Almost certainly not.","30_2"

Cruz and co. plan to object to the election results in order to make that case, and I think that this shift in rhetoric will give at least a few additional Republicans cover to join these challenges without formally embracing the election results that we dont like are presumptively unlawful approach advocated by the Presidents team.

I could entertain the idea if there were genuine irregularities or sufficient predicate for a fraud probe, but there isn't (as the top comment demonstrates). 

I always compare it to what happened in 2016. There were a lot of people genuinely distraught when Trump won and many people who believed that the election integrity was compromised, but even with all that he was still inaugurated. His electoral college votes were counted. He still got to be President. The investigation into the election happened in the background.

I'm not an expert or in PA and may get some details wrong but the TL;DR is:

1. Jim Brewster won an extremely close election. There was a PA supreme court case that allowed mail-in ballots that weren't properly dated by the voter, and these votes pushed him over the edge.

2. PA GOP voted to have President Pro Tempore Jake Corman run the swearing in ceremony instead of Lt. Gov John Fetterman. This was after Fetterman refused to pay attention to their motion asking for Brewster to not be sworn in (which made them very unhappy),

3. Except this was likely unconstitutional, because by PA constitution you can't just kick out the Lt. Governer except in specific circumstances.

4. Chaos ensued. I think the day ended without Brewster ever being sworn in and a bunch of people pretending Brewster wasn't a senator (note that this leaves a PA district without a state senator at all until it's sorted out, at least ceremonially)

However, once that happens then there needs to be a process for swiftly seating the legitimate winner if the controversy is resolved in their favor.

They forced everyone in the House to go on record that the new House members, including those from the swing states, were legally elected and allowed to sit. These House folks were on the same ballot sheets as Trump/Biden. So if the House reps were counted fairly, then that implies the President was counted fairly also.

[Here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32717.pdf) is a good primer that explains the process from the CRS.

&gt;Section 15 establishes a procedure for making and acting on objections to the counting of one or more of the electoral votes from a state or the District of Columbia. When the certificate or equivalent paper from each state or the District of Columbia is read, the President of the Senate shall call for objections, if any. Any such objection must be presented in writing and must be signed by at least one Senator and one Representative. The objection shall state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the ground thereof. During the joint session of January 6, 2001, the presiding officer intervened on several occasions to halt attempts to make speeches under the guise of offering an objection.

&gt;When an objection, properly made in writing and endorsed by at least one Senator and one Representative, is received, each house is to meet and consider it separately. The statute states, No votes or papers from any other State shall be acted upon until the objections previously made to the votes or papers from any State shall have been finally disposed of. However, in 1873, before enactment of the law now in force, the joint session agreed, without objection and for reasons of convenience, to entertain objections with regard to two or more states before the houses met separately on any of them.

&gt;The joint session does not act on any objections that are made. Instead, the joint session is suspended, the Senate withdraws from the House chamber, and each house meets separately to debate the objection and vote whether, based on the objection, to count the vote or votes in question. Both houses must vote separately to agree to the objection by simple majority. Otherwise, the objection fails and the vote or votes are counted. (3 U.S.C. §15 provides that the two Houses concurrently may reject the vote or votes.)


[...]

&gt;Section 17 lays out procedures for each house to follow when debating and voting on an objection. These procedures limit debate on the objection to not more than two hours, during which each Member may speak only once and for not more than five minutes. Then it shall be the duty of the presiding officer of each House to put the main question without further debate.","62_2"

&gt;The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic. The congressional power to reject electors is reserved for the most extreme and unusual circumstances. These are far from it. More Americans participated in this election than ever before, and they made their choice. President Trumps lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed. The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. The Presidential Voter Fraud Commission disbanded without finding such evidence.
  
&gt;My fellow Senator Ted Cruz and the co-signers of his statement argue that rejection of electors or an election audit directed by Congress would restore trust in the election. Nonsense. This argument ignores the widely perceived reality that Congress is an overwhelmingly partisan body; the American people wisely place greater trust in the federal courts where judges serve for life. Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgement for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it.
 
&gt;Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents.
 
&gt;Adding to this ill-conceived endeavor by some in Congress is the Presidents call for his supporters to come to the Capitol on the day when this matter is to be debated and decided. This has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse.

Even if the Joint Session date isn't explicitly stated in the constitution it's the last official act where a performative institutional speech act (declaring EC vote totals and a winner) occurs prior to the swearing in of the President-Elect.

Changes to that singular official act will be moot after it's performed, and so any legal action would need to attach to some new official act after that (and this particular lawsuit wouldn't work for those purposes, because there would be an entirely different defendant, and a new set of arguments to make.)  So... the inauguration would be the new target date.

Chief Justice John Roberts would, I believe, be a necessary defendant (and a target of an injunction) in any legal proceedings post Jan 6th, and it is too ridiculous to consider any Federal judge considering standing in that case.   Could the plaintiffs file *something?*  Sure.  Will Federal judges be rightfully offended at the idea of considering an injunction against the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS? I think very much so.

That's why I'm not even sure there will be new legal maneuvers after that date (at least ones that actually aim at relief that could change the result and declare Trump the winner) because I think that may be the step which will finally offend the sensibility of Federal judges, and they would be forced to defend the propriety of the Federal Judiciary (and the lawyers involved, as shameless as they are, would know that.)","65_2_1_2"

It is essentially telling the court that the plaintiffs have zero standing to sue Vice President Pence, and that the injunction mandating that he perform acts contrary to the text of U.S. Code Title 3 should be denied. (Standing is the most fundamental precept in law for a court.  Without standing, the court may not act.)

He attacks standing of the plaintiffs on all of the usual premises (including asserting that they have identified an inappropriate defendant, and further noted this complaint does not address those bodies which could provide standing,) and while he does point the court to the proper defendants (the Senate and House,) this response does not suggest the claim has particular merit (indeed the response casts doubt on whether there is an injury in fact, and not just a speculative potential of injury.)

If VP Pence was seriously looking to collaborate on this lawsuit, the last thing he would do is to attack plaintiffs' standing, but instead to provide a weak and convoluted defense, looking to give the court a reason to provide relief (and certainly not a response asking to outright deny injunctive relief.)

This response, in my reading, does not bolster any view that the V.P. is looking to play fast and loose with the rules on Jan 6.

I did a little digging and the poll pads must have wifi (or cellular) to do anything, for any sort of sizeable voting operation wifi makes more sense than cellular. So on the surface he lied about them not having wifi.

But no, they counted the physical paper ballots they had in custody. Why would they print off other ballots when they literally have the physical paper ballots? The ballots once processed and tabulated on election day were secured in individually marked batches for storage and later recounting. You can watch those same batches get checked out, validated, and recounted on the dozens of livestreams that watched the process.

Rasmussen called for this ""strategy"", approvingly quoting Staln to do this:

https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1343193422996393987

This would be clearly illegal, as the Electoral Count Act specifies that all certificates purporting to be electoral votes shall be opened. It would seem their idea is for Pence is to ignore the law and declare Trump the winner. 

I don't think Pence would dare to try this, as it almost certainly wouldn't work and something like this could lead to sedition charges. Any thoughts on what would happen if a VP did try to go rogue?

Say Pence is reading the electoral votes and came to Arizona, the first alphabetically of the so called ""Disputed States"". Pence declares that no valid electoral votes have been received, and attempt to proceed to Arkansas. A congressman and senator object (likely several), Pence rules the objection out of order as there is no legal mechanism to force him to count votes, and attempts to use position chairing the meeting to count a Trump victory. 

Would this lead to:

-The House Seargant-At-Arms removing Pence from the House so that the Senate Pro Tem could count the electoral votes?

-The Supreme Court being asked to rule that Pence's action was illegal and that Biden is president for having gotten the most electoral votes?

-Biden declaring that he still won the election, that Pence's actions were illegal, and then he will proceed to take the oath of office Jan. 20 and order the secret service/military to remove Trump?

I'm thinking all of that potential chaos is a reason this won't happen. The right-wingers who advocate for a dictatorial move like Trump ignoring electoral votes haven't through would what happen next if they actually tried it. I can't imagine Pence would want to risk going to jail and being known as the man who tried to destroy democracy for something that would likely fail.","73"

If Pence tried something like this (and I'm not sure he could even try, he just runs the proceedings, congress still has the power) and was so completely recalcitrant that congress and saner head couldn't talk him off the ledge and somehow no legal options could resolve the problem. Then as a nuclear option, the House could challenge a slate and not return with a vote - setting up a scenario where nothing is done until January 20 where both Trump and Pence are removed from office resulting in acting POTUS Pelosi.

This is the suit brought by the two legislators (to be clear, not the legislature). Today in oral arguments they brought up some other statute during the case which they think grants them these powers and grants the court the jurisdiction to compel compliance with their subpoenas. The Judge dismissed this case and granted leave for them to file an amended complaint with that argument. 

The case on the part of the Maricopa Board of Supervisors looking to quash the subpoenas as unconstitutional is still pending. 

**The underlying facts of this whole thing are pretty shocking**. The Arizona judiciary committee (+ some random hard right legislator not on the committee) held a hearing where all of these Maricopa officials voluntarily came and explained in great detail why all of the voter fraud conspiracies were idiotic. These two legislators - Fann and Farnsworth - said ""fuck it"", that doesn't demonstrate enough obeisance to their dear leader, Donald. And then decided to - in their personal capacity as legislators - issue incredible, sweeping subpoenas demanding that the Maricopa Board of Supervisors produce ballot images of every single secret ballot they received (ballots secret under the law) and their voting machines + every single adjacent component and piece of information (including logins, passwords etc.) to these two *legislators* for ""forensic audit"". 

For their part, the Maricopa BoS has explained that they can't hand over secret ballots by law, and that even if these legislators had the power to order a forensic audit, the BoS was willing to do one voluntarily, but cannot right now as the machines are subject to active litigation.

The state legislature has no subpoena power beyond compelling witness testimony under Arizona law. Also, Fann/Farnsworth didn't take a vote of the senate judiciary committee, they didn't vote on a resolution in the committee much less the senate as they're supposed to, they didn't follow their own senate rules to pass the issue to a vote to hold these Maricopa officials in contempt, and the senate isn't even in session so none of this is possible. They're acting in their personal capacities as *legislators*. Under their theory, any legislator with the appropriate position (including committee head) could issue subpoenas in their personal capacity with essentially unlimited scope and power. It's an unbelievable extension / abuse of power.","83_1"

The court cannot issue that kind of order just because the people served with the subpoenas are public officials, the judge said.

Yes. That's the point. The military academies are different than other institutions of higher learning.

Graduates of the Naval Academy are commissioned as Ensigns in the US Navy or Second Lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps. Etc etc etc.

While the educational benefits of diversity might be a compelling governmental interest, the national defense benefits of a diverse armed forces is a stronger one.

Second, I can see how the argument that affirmative action is truly the least restrictive means for diversifying the student body of military academies is stronger than for regular universities. There are only 5 military academies in the US. A practice that only applies to 5 schools with specialized national defense purposes seems more ""narrowly tailored"" than a practice affecting every university in the land. Additionally, those schools have much smaller applicant pools than regular universities, and might have to focus more directly on race in order to achieve a diverse student body.","1_3_3"

Then, the next time they take up the issue, conservative justices will gloss over all the stuff except for the conservative parts, and act like they are bound by precedent. 

Roberts is a master of using this technique to push the law to the right, while winning praise for being a reasonable moderate. But maybe the best example is how a conservative SCOTUS managed to exclude poverty from being a protected class under the 14th, without ever evaluating whether poor people deserve equal protection under the law. 

The first case that explicitly rejects poverty as a protected class is Harris V McRae, which says,  ""this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification."" But if you follow the citations, they point to:

- James v. Valtierra, in which the 4-justice *dissent* argues that poor people deserve the same protection under the law as everyone else, but the actual majority opinion is completely silent on that topic, and;

- Maher vs Roe (the first step of the two-step) which says, ""this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.'' And cites San Antonio School District v Rodriguez when it flatly states that ""Financial need alone does not identify a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. **See San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez**"".

Okay, so let's look at San Antonio School District (SASD) versus Rodriguez (this shit is exhausting)...

- In SASD v Rodriguez, this *was* a case claiming that Texas's system for funding schools was discriminatory against poor people, so this would be exactly where we would expect to find the reasoning that says poor people are not protected by the Equal Protection Clause. But instead, the conservative majority opinion again dodges the substance of that question, and instead ruled basically on technicalities, that heightened scrutiny does not apply, because equal access to Education is not a fundamental right, therefore only rational basis applies (if this seems at odds with Brown v Board and other rulings, well...yeah, it's bullshit). The opinion essentially dodges whether poverty *would* or *should* be covered under equal protection, and makes some vague noises that ""poor"" people would be really hard to define, and that the Texas system sort of discriminates about funding in ways that are haphazard relative to individual poverty, so they don't really need to get into that question.

So yeah, the claim in Harris v McRae that """"this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification"" is basically a lie. But it's also now black-letter law. A more honest way to phrase it would have been ""this Court has gone through so many contortions to avoid directly answering whether poor people are entitled to equal protection under the law, that it's time to just let it go, and say they are not."" But of course, that would require conservative justices to be honest. 

And this is how conservatives dodge admitting to what they actually believe. Because it's kind of impossible to make an honest and coherent argument that poor people don't actually deserve equal protection under the law. But if we say the poor people *do* deserve the same treatment by the state as anyone else, that could massively upend a whole ton of privileges and norms that people like SCOTUS justices and their powerful and affluent friends really like. Like, they might have to pay way more taxes, or find that their neighborhoods get way less preferential spending on things like infrastructure and education, or they might find drastic changes to zoning laws that protect their towns from the kind of housing that poor people tend to live in, etc. Laws that discriminate against poor people are simultaneously indefensible, and also really important to the status-quo social order that people like judges very much want to preserve. 

They basically need a way to draw the line, like ""just no. We gave nominally equal rights to blacks and jews and women and the handicapped, but no--giving equal protection to poor people is just going way too far.""

And Roberts is a gold-medalist at this kind of stuff. I'm too burnt out to dig up good cites right now, but maybe I will try later. His most blatant one was maybe striking down the Muslim ban, while basically including instructions on how to re-submit it a few weeks later, except with Venezuela and North Korea added to the list, so now it's okay. Another classic (that we have yet to see the punchline for) was joining the liberals in Bostock v Clayton, so that he could hand the opinion to Gorsuch, who ruled that employment discrimination against gays is unconstitutional, *but* that employers might be able to seek a religious exemption (having previously established in Hobby Lobby that corporations can have protected religious beliefs). And liberal commentators were praising that as a huge bipartisan win for civil rights, not seeing how what it's really doing is laying the groundwork for employers to use religious beliefs as a carve-out to anti-discrimination law, which is what conservatives have wanted for decades. It's creating a right, for the purposes of incrementally hollowing that same right and others, in subsequent decisions. 

It's infuriating and exhausting, precisely because of the way they use this relentless formalistic incrementalism to chip away at voting rights, civil liberties, all of it. It's a years-long project for conservative judges to use opinions that seem moderate or even liberal, to signal to FedSoc types how to bring the next case, that will get the conservative outcome they want, but even stronger, because it seem bound by this bullshit precedent they are laying the groundwork for in the footnotes and parenthetical remarks and so on.","2_1_1_1_1"

Roberts has figured out that, if you want to, for example, prevent women and blacks from voting too much (because how else are republicans ever going to win elections again?), then you need to lay a complicated framework of technical-sounding formalist precedents that sort of gradually funnel the law and the constitution into meaning something other than what it says.

Scalia could get away with just making shit up, because he was working in a time when the popular and political norms were closer to his worldview. So he could just proclaim that a well established tradition of police discretion in matters of law enforcement overrules the constitution, federal legislation, and even a fucking explicit court order with the relevant portion written in all caps instructing police to stop this guy from murdering his children, while the mother is begging them, in the police station, to stop him from murdering those specific children and telling them where he was murdering them, and the police instead went on dinner break. (Later the guy drove to the police station with the dead bodies of the children and the police killed him in a shootout).

Scalia could get away with just making up standards like well established tradition as the supreme law of the land, because he was operating in a time when people had a lot more faith in the intrinsic goodness and decency of uniformed police, etc. 

Roberts knows that his party ideology stands upon a knifes edge, and needs to find ways to gain structural control over the machinery and institutions of government while maintaining a veneer of neutrality, and he knows that he is in a race against time, but that he still has to do it two-steps-forward, one-step-back, so as not to reveal the bit.

A huge part of the problem is that the whole sort of ecosystem surrounding SCOTUS, all of the clerks, bloggers, reporters, lawyers, circuit judges, etc...they are all so invested in maintaining the godlike prestige of the institution, because they themselves are sort of part of the system. 

Like, if you're a lawyer arguing before SCOTUS, you're not going to call them out as a bunch of bullshit artists who wear freaking robes out in public to make themselves look godlike. If you're a clerk or a federal circuit judge, you're not going to torpedo your own incredibly-cushy career by pointing out that half the time, they are just making shit up. If you're a reporter on SCOTUS beat, that's like, the top of your game. It's not an assignment that you're just looking to move on from or get to the bottom of so you can go back to covering school board meetings, so you depend on access to those same clerks and lawyers and judges, and the whole sort of DC cocktail party networks. And besides, you probably really *want* to believe that you are covering very serious and important and smart things....

So SCOTUS writes the opinions in typically very formalized, dense, citation-heavy, hard-to-read style, to try to make it look like it's some kind of scientific paper or super-technical process, and for the most part, the rest of the world relies on this ecosystem of reporters and clerks and bloggers to interpret the holy scrolls handed down by the court. 

In order to see how much of it actually just bullshit, you need to not only read the opinions, but read the citations, and where those citations lead. Because that's how they make up law. They include some vague speculative throwaway line in one opinion, and then they write a subsequent opinion that references that vague speculation, and then they write another opinion asserting that the speculation is well-established precedent, and viola, it's black-letter law.","2_1_1_1_1_2_1"

That's only really true if racism manifests purely by lowering family income.  It ignores direct racism (eg, black kids getting lower grades or harsher discipline because of bias) and indirect non-economic effects of racism.  For instance, black kids are far more likely to live in a city, and therefore in a much more crowded and underfunded school district than a white kid at the same income level.

If the point is to lift up smart kids who have lower grades because of their economic circumstances, you're right.  If the point is to lift up smart kids who have lower grades due to the social and personal effects of racial bias, that bias does need something like AA that operates on that axis.

First, slaves were rented out so ownership isnt a determining factor. Also small farmers were the most likely to rent slaves. However, thats not the full story. Institutions rented slaves, The University of Virgina rented over 100  slaves who performed almost all of the non faculty work at the school. Every student who attended benefited from slavery. Cities also rented slaves to perform work for the city. Do you benefit from your trash being picked up, the streetlights being turned on and roads being built and maintained? 

Finally even in the north, people benefitted from slave labor because it made their products cheaper. Thats one of the reasons we associate slavery with cotton. Cotton was not a main crop until the last 50 years of slavery, but it wasnt profitable without slave labor and extremely profitable using slave labor.

This addresses a pretty small fraction of my point. For example, how many whites benefitted from redlining and the related racist lending practices? How many whites have benefitted from racist hiring practices over the years (we have studies only a decade old showing very clear and substantial bias here)?

As for blind interviews, if you want to keep minorities out of opportunities, I can't think of a better policy to pursue. A lot of orchestras tried blind auditions, the result was a decrease in diversity. Not because of the inherent superiority of the Nordic race, but because White families are more likely to have the time and money to send little Susie to Cello practice.

Some universities in the US (notably Harvard) base their admissions at least in part on the race of the applicant. For instance, because African Americans are a historically disadvantaged group, Harvard admissions would be biased in their favor to account for what was essentially not their fault. In addition, because of the high proportion of Asian immigrants coming to the US specifically for higher education for themselves or their kids, Asians are on average better candidates than other races, so a lot of the extra admissions spaces that were allocated for African Americans were taken from the Asian population. Basically, Harvard was discriminating based on race in order to make their classes more representative of the population.

The plaintiff in this case was an organization that represents the interests of Asian students. On account of Affirmative Action policies, Asian students were at a distinct disadvantage compared to applicants who belonged to other minority groups, particularly Black and African American students. To illustrate this, at Harvard college, the most prestigious (and one of, if not the most) exclusive undergraduate universities, Asian students in the 10th decile of academic performance were less likely to be admitted than Black students in the 4th decile. In other words, Black students who were more qualified than 40% of applicants stood a better chance of admittance than Asian students who outperformed 90% of applicants. This is all while knowing that Harvard considered an applicants race, and race alone, to be a substantive and meaningful aspect of that applicants candidacy. 

Im not familiar with how the higher education system works in Australia, but in the U.S, attending a prestigious university to the likes of Harvard and UNC is positively correlated with a higher quality of life as well as significantly greater career earnings. To many, it is life changing. Simply moving on and studying at a different school would entail diminishing your odds of achieving best outcome that the U.S. university system proclaims to provide. 

In summary, to be a Black applicant at such a prestigious university meant owning an inherent advantage, which necessarily meant that being an applicant of any other minority group meant being at a disadvantage. The Supreme Court ruled this to be unconstitutional on the basis of the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment, which necessitates that the law be applied equally to every American, regardless of whichever minority designation they may qualify for. In other words, the pursuit of racial equity is a zero-sum game, and such equity cannot be achieved by favoring a particular minority group at the expense another.","25_1"

What do you think of Sotomayors dissent stating that these same categories are used in the US Census and by extension plenty of other things? Would you go so far as to say that everything which uses those classifications is unconstitutional?","31_1"

Re the census, I don't see any injury to listing the race, and hence no equal protection clause violation.  In the instant case, recognition of race was not the problem - the problem was conferring a benefit based on the recognition of race (and an injury to the non-admitted party).  That is, the Harvard admission scheme treated applicants differently depending on their race.

The US Census does not treat anyone differently on the basis of race.  It merely records information - information which is self-reported.

As to whether ""everything"" that uses racial classifications is unconstitutional, the answer is no.  Roberts explains in the Court's decision that there *are* instances where racial classification schemes can pass strict scrutiny. The example used is racial segregation in prisons in order to avoid race-based prison riots.  In that instance, the state goal (preventing riots in prisons) is compelling, and the means chosen (segregating prisoners by race) is the only realistic way to achieve that goal (i.e., the means are necessary).  So some types of racial classifications may survive strict scrutiny.

The important thing to remember is that in this case, the racial classifications were being used to confer a benefit - admission - upon one group while conferring an injury - non-admission - to another group. 

Note that private entities can still discriminate on the basis of race.  It will be interesting to see if Harvard gives up all federal funding in order to maintain it's affirmative action program, because it could do that.  So this case does not end racial classifications in every area of life, but it does mean that the tax payer no longer has to fund racially-discriminatory practices, even ""well-meaning"" racially-discriminatory practices.","31_1_1"

One research review article published just this month discusses the issue as relevant to this ruling:

[Transgenerational Inheritance and Systemic Racism in America](https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20220043)


Relevant bits:

* _**It is well established that personal experiences of trauma, adversity, and discrimination can get under the skin and increase risk for a whole host of negative mental and physical health outcomes. The aim of this article is to review emerging research on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which suggests that negative exposures in one generation, can also be passed down to affect the health and wellbeing of future generations.**_

* *Ancestral traumas can negatively impact the wellbeing of grandchildren and great grandchildren.*

 *While most research on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance has been conducted in animals, studies in humans have shown ancestor's exposure to trauma, poor nutrition, and toxic chemicals can impact the health of descendants across several generations.*

 *A role for evidencebased trauma treatments, culturally adapted prevention and intervention programs, and enrichment opportunities is strongly indicated to reduce and prevent the impact of personal and ancestral adversities.*

 *In addressing ancestral traumas, however, true healing will require acknowledgement of the harms that were done, and broader systemic level changes.*


From that last, it is obvious that the authors have an agenda. However, if the premise of the review is correct, then the agenda is warranted:

Quite literally, the *physical* effects of 20 generations of slavery continue to have a measurable effect on the health and behavior of descendants of slaves more than 150 years after the last slave was born in the USA. This is independent of any current financial/social circumstance and upbringing of any individual whose ancestors were slaves in this country, and due to the self-reinforcing effects of transgenerational trauma, will continue to have an effect for quite a while beyond 29 June, 2023, the date of this ruling.","60"

It was very clear that to them, school was only for students to get an academic education. And the experiences and perspectives brought from a diverse student body was not highly valued.

At one point Alito made the analogy that admissions was like a race. And URM applicants were given a headstart if race is considered. And therefore, other applicants were being discriminated against. Sotomayor countered with the notion that considering diversity was giving the URM applicants a boost so that they would be starting from the same spot, not ahead of others.

Roberts quoted O'Connor's decision about race being used for admissions purposes eventually needing to go away. It seems he thinks that time has come.

Fields with fewer positions to train in were dominated by the highest scores, because when you have 20000 people applying, you need a differentiating feature to immediately cut through the ""bullshit"", otherwise you'll be stuck reading things forever.

Very true. I think it's important to have socioeconomic diversity within minority groups, as much as possible.  That's why I like the idea of using location as one part of the admission. The college can choose students from areas with high minority populations, like the District of Columbia. It has a large population of POC of different socioeconomic backgrounds.

Preclearance is an extraordinary remedy justified by particular circumstances that existed in 1965 (and before).

In that case, elites and the middle class would say they were disadvantaged.  And if Asians are part of that middle class, they would be disadvantaged too.

What racial gerrymandering or race based voter suppression?

Politicians dont care what race you are, they care how you will vote. In that way, if race were used to gerrymander its just a proxy for party affiliation (which the republicans tried to use directly in NC and that got shut down.) Seeing as its clearly illegal to gerrymander off of race, politicians are going to use other data like educational attainment or income levels or population density. 

And the only thing close to race based voter suppression would be when I heard of a disproportion voting locations per capita in urban areas vs rural areas. Which if you had the same # of voting locations per capita then youd have reduced average distance to voting location in an urban area and would be suppressing the rural vote.

Also, because circumstances and potential aren't seperate immutable factors but instead mutually interact, if the point of AA was merely to normalize over circumstances, there would be little reason to care about the diversity of the student body or to expect it to reflect the makeup of the nation.

For instance, wealth is correlated with race, and poorer parents are worse at feeding their children a healthy diet (for all sorts of reasons). Early life nutrition has a significant impact on development, and so the potential of poor kids is permanently negatively affected by their circumstances. As a result, in a system that perfectly assessed potential, you would still expect the upper echelons of society to have a different racial makeup than the society as a whole due to injustice occuring at the very beginning of the pipeline.

That means that a goal for the racial makeup to reflect the general society is actually *directly incompatible* with a goal to ""not to reward or repair anything, [but] to correctly understand potential.""

But my point is, the problem is not affirmative action because affirmative action by design was for those who are not white/ those who are not given the same opportunities.

I would tend to believe that based on previous rulings Roberts at least would try to make sure affirmative action stays but rule against Harvard based on the civil rights act.

I dont see why youre referring to two laws as the same. Title VII is about employment; Title VI is about admissions at universities. But you could be referring to EEO and affirmative action, where employers recruit for diversity, which will not be impacted. Theyre all about civil rights and related because university graduates are hired more often than those without higher education. A couple of the justices pointed this out during the hearing. 

As for how the court will rule, Justice Brown will be part of the UNC decision, not Harvards, because she recused herself since she was on Harvards committee and did not want to give the perception of bias. 

So who knows how the court will rule? I am numb with zero trust at this point. If anything, there were clues that without affirmative action, things would be worse; plus, the attorneys for the Asian applicants havent proved that Asians were harmed more than other minorities regardless of one of over forty measures that they were rated lower on. And both sides admit that affirmative action still leaves minorities disadvantaged, and its worse at schools with race-neutral policies.

Its not clear that Sotomayors counter argument is correct regarding &boost so that theyd be starting from the same spot.

A head start would be if someone started a 100 meter sprint with a 5 meter headstart. He argued that considering the race of an applicant gives an URM a 5 meter advantage. Sotomayor's point was that perhaps considering race gives an applicant, who is disadvantaged 5 meters from the start because of socioeconomic status and/or racial disadvantages experienced in this country, a boost so that both runners start from the same spot.

In that piece, on pages 16-18 he notes that part of the reasoning underlying the majority opinion, which allowed race-conscious admissions, is that there is social science supporting the idea that there are educational benefits that flow from an integrated learning environment. Thomas then says, well, if we are using social science to make policy about race-conscious decision making, here is *my* science:

&gt;The Court never acknowledges, however, the growing evidence that racial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students. See, e.g., Flowers &amp; Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College Racial Composition on African American Students After 3 Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669, 674 (1999) (concluding that black students experience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and that, even among blacks, a substantial diversity moderates the cognitive effects of attending an HBC);

Thomas' point is that the potential benefits flowing from an integrated educational body are not necessarily certain (in his mind at least), and therefore using social science as a part of the basis for allowing race-conscious admissions could, in the face of his preferred new studies, be used just as logically to show the benefits of racial segregation. So, if you have to provide deference to those statements about racially integrated education, you would also have to provide deference to science showing the benefits of racially segregated education. Then he calls the majority segregationist:

&gt;Contained within today's majority opinion is the seed of a new constitutional justification for a concept I thought long and rightly rejected - racial segregation.

So, in short, what he is saying is that he doesn't put much stock in the benefits of a diverse study body because **he** has logically tortured that statement until it paradoxically becomes an endorsement of racial segregation. In other words, he doesn't put much stock in it because of *his* arguments for why it would support segregation.","3_1"

The point isn't that social science points one way or another, but that if evidence showing educational benefits is sufficient to justify race-conscious decision making, then if that evidence pointed towards segregation being beneficial, it would logically also be constitutional.

Therefore, the reasoning goes, since *that* conclusion is clearly wrong (that segregation would be constitutional if only the science supported it having benefits in some context), it can't be the case, as a matter of law, that scientific justifications are sufficient to apply race-conscious decision making, no matter what those justifications are.

It doesn't really matter where the evidence actually points in this argument, because that isn't a matter of law but a matter of fact.","3_1_1"

I guess it just really bothers me that advocates for a more integrated educational system are being called segregationists, which led me to inadvertently chose invective over analysis.

&gt;It can't be the case that scientific justifications are sufficient to apply race-conscious decision making, no matter what those justifications are.

I think you're spot on that this is how Thomas frames it, but this line of argument just doesn't make sense to me. If an advocate could convincingly produce studies that show that the failure of the federal government to protect an integrated system of education would cause serious and lasting harm to racial minorities, that seems like the exact type of factual predicate which should be sufficient to trigger the protections of the 14th amendment. I think facts and science should play an integral role in shaping how we apply the law, at least where it is possible to measure the privileges and protections afforded by the law itself.

Moreover, this argument naturally assumes the counterfactual that was rejected in *Brown:* that systems of racial segregation don't positively cause stigmatic harm to individuals who are excluded as a result of state sanctioned segregation. So, even if you could show that there *are* educational benefits to segregation as Thomas posits, that still doesn't resolve the issue presented by the state inflicting a status-harm on individuals as a result of their race.","3_1_1_1"

His take is that racial classification itself is the original sin. Segregation is wrong from first principles because it relies on race. It doesn't matter whether some particular facts on some particular day can be offered for or against the educational effects of segregation or integration or diversity. If it uses race then it is wrong in the same way that murder is wrong.

So for him, you don't suspend the prohibition on racial classification for any reason, just like you don't suspend free speech when Nazis want to march. It sure is harmful when Nazis have rallies but we don't engage in some kind of cost-benefit analysis; we take it as axiomatic that suspending 1A is not an option. 

This is the way Thomas thinks and for him it is just self-evident.

Also, some of the proponents of race-conscious admissions do indeed make segregationist style arguments.

For example, they suggest that Blacks need Black doctors rather than doctors [of any race] who are qualified and skilled with the specific concerns of the demographic community being served and sensitive to the individualized needs and life experiences of their patients.

It is infantile thinking and the math does not work in many regions and moreover it is paternalistic. If a Black med student aspires to practice on Martha's Vineyard or in some other white enclave as a high dollar dermatologist, then so be it. It is neosegregationist to suggest that they ought to serve disadvantaged Black communities and leave all the high-dollar stuff to whites or Asian Americans.","3_1_1_1_1"

Now, you'd counter with, but that's not what the science shows it's a ""fact"" that diversity is a net positive. But is it really fact? I'm sure studies 70 years ago found segregation to be beneficial. Obviously that ""fact"" changed. So what if a future study reasonably concluded that diversity was a net negative and other studies backed that up? Should policies change to reflect this and favor segregation? Probably not.

Ill argue that weve already determined that segregation is fundamentally unjust: separate cannot be equal. While some might argue that segregation results in better test scores for white students, or male students, or heterosexual students (none of which is borne out by modern science), considering only the outcome for white, male, and heterosexual students is fundamentally unsound logic. The results of the minority, female, and LGBTQ students must also be considered.

History has proven that separate systems of education fail the minority populations to a profound degree.

And so segregation is not an option (nor should it be; in an equal and equitable society any person should have the right to apply to any school they desire). Given that the races must rightly be allowed to mix, the next question is how much mixing is the most beneficial to all students in aggregate?

To that end, the science demonstrates that more diversity is more beneficial to the educations of all involved. A diversity of experience leads to a diversity of ideas which, in turn, leads to a mutual understanding between people whose paths may have otherwise never crossed.

But even if we ignore the science, it is plain to see that any society where segregation is not legal needs to take strides to ensure that end runs around that illegality through bureaucratic means do not take place. Basing enrollment purely on a test that historically favors white male test takers is not dissimilar from the voter tests of the Jim Crow days. Its a bureaucratic means to segregation in fact, if not officially in practice.

Recognizing both the inherent bias of the testing process, and the historical reasons that minorities in America are underprivileged, the colleges have endeavored to protect themselves from falling into a bureaucratic segregation trap, and we should applaud them for upholding what I believe is the very fabric of the American ideal that all people are created equal and should be given equal opportunity to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.","3_4_1_1"

Too much of a good thing, and all that. I dont know how granular they were being though; the experience of Japanese students is culturally very different from that of Korean or Chinese students. Same for all the other Asian nations.

That said, theres definitely a point where if you admit too many people from a similar background, you begin excluding others, and then youre losing diversity rather than gaining it. 

At that point any argument in favor of affirmative action supports a reversal. The goal should be a healthy mix of all ethnicities, not homogeneity of any particular one, even if that one is historically a minority.","3_4_1_1_1_1"

Strayhorn, 2008), attending a HBCU was associated with higher occupational status in the
present study. Specifically, findings suggest that African American college graduates who have
similar educational and personal histories, who are the same with respect to age and marital
status, who share similar levels of social and cultural capital, and who attend comparable
undergraduate institutions are more likely to assume high status occupations if they attend a
historically Black college. Indeed, this is good news for HBCUs and lends powerful support to
their continuing significance (Strayhorn &amp; Hirt, 2008). As I argued in the earlier work, this
12
finding may reflect that HBCUs continue to produce the vast majority of Black professionals
and those who the Black community and society in general have acknowledged as Black
leaders

So HBCU produce doctors, lawyers, politicians but because they work as leaders in the black community, their salaries are lower because they live in lower income areas.

Like a lawyer graduating from a HBCU that decides to go live in Jackson, MS to represent underserved and discriminated tenants is obviously in a higher tier career (Law) but has a significantly lower salary because of where he works and the type of law he practices (Jackson, MS and Housing Law)

It's possible the lawyer at some small firm in Jackson, MS ends up reaching partner faster (less competition) and thus is viewed as higher status than a lower ranking associate at big law who actually nets a lot more, but again, this is subjective.

Assigning people higher and lower personal score is just wrong, even if its for diversity. 

Tell me a reason why Asians should be borne to be scored lower in personal scores than other races, for no other reason than being born Asian. If universities value diversity so much, then do more outreach to disadvantaged racial groups communities. Assigning a personal score to reach racial equity is just an easy, lazy, and unjust way to achieve diversity goals.

When was the last time you heard about Harvard reaching out to Black communities in Camden or Hispanic communities in Laredo? They are starting to do some, but nowhere nearly enough, so they want the shortcut.

I am Kazakhstani. I am pretty sure Kazakh-Americans are no more advantaged than most second-generation Hispanic kids from San Diego, yet apparently I am scored less because I am Asian.

The Fourteenth Amendment, Section I states:
&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Especially nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law - How is Affirmative Action not a law that deprives Asians like me life of being fairly treated under the law in equal to other races when it comes to education and employment? 

I honestly believe Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, and for the same reason SFFA v. Harvard should apply the same. The overturn by Dobbs v. Jackson was bullshit, but if you believe in Roe v. Wade but say that the Fourteenth Amendment doesnt apply in this case, I would personally love to hear a reason why you think people like myself should be scored lower for being born in Almaty to Kazakh/Uyghur parents.","5"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/yikx41/justice_thomas_says_he_does_not_have_a_clue_what/","TheRealRockNRolla","2022-10-31",1667250168,32,32,0,0,"To state some of the problems with this:

First and most importantly, what SFFA is trying to do is destroy the concept of affirmative action entirely. If your problem with the decades of precedent and practice comprising affirmative action is that it unfairly penalizes Asian-Americans - which is the only criticism you've raised - then surely it makes more sense to see if there's a way to *fix that problem*, rather than ripping down the entire structure and prohibiting universities from considering race at all. 

Indeed, you open your post by saying you agree with affirmative action in principle, you just disagree with the way it's being carried out. In that case, it makes *way* more sense to *fix* the way it's being carried out than to categorically prohibit it as its challengers would like to do. And if your response to this is something like, 'well it's unfixable, there's just no way to do it that will give people of every racial identity a fair system,' then your position is basically indistinguishable from opposing the basic principle of affirmative action.

Second, building on the prior point, the vast majority of the people challenging affirmative action - and their leaders and prominent voices - are not doing it because they think racial equity and diversity in higher education are crucial, and they just happen to think it's too unfair to Asian-Americans. More bluntly, they don't give a shit about Asian-Americans. They're doing it because it advantages white Americans at the expense of Black Americans. Let's call it what it is, which is part of a broader conservative project to undo the signature achievements of the Civil Rights Movement. The push to get rid of affirmative action is inseparable from the push to make it easier to effectively segregate primary education, to discriminate in employment, to suppress minorities' voting power, to keep racial undesirables out of the country, and so on, and so on, and so on. The argument that affirmative action is *actually* racist because it hurts Asian-Americans is just a convenient narrative meant to further a project conceived and executed primarily by white racists.

There's a reason [Scalia openly said that it would be better if Black people went to ""lesser schools"".](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/dec/09/supreme-court-affirmative-action-fisher-v-university-of-texas) There's a reason [vocal racist Amy Wax went on vocal racist Tucker Carlson's show to criticize affirmative action as a ""poison"" infecting all of higher education.](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-nation/upenn-law-professor-tells-tucker-carlson-blacks-and-other-non-western-groups-harbor) One could go on and on; I'm no expert in this area and these are just the examples that come most readily to mind. The point is that it is the people most devoted to empowering racism in this country in every other context that are behind the movement to get rid of affirmative action entirely. If you're genuinely concerned about the well-being of Asian-Americans in higher education and think they are not getting a fair shake under affirmative action as it currently exists, *these fucking people* are not your allies.

Third, you seem to be saying that universities must not be concerned enough about racism because they're not doing enough ""outreach to disadvantaged racial groups' communities."" I'm with you as far as that goes - immensely wealthy, elite institutions like Harvard and UNC could certainly stand to do more to help real-world social well-being, particularly in the communities they occupy. Where you lose me is when you demand to know what they're doing in Camden or Laredo. It is weird and illogical to demand that universities not do affirmative action in an attempt to ameliorate the harms caused by racism until and unless they can... what, fix racism in some of the most heavily disadvantaged communities in the country? That would be like saying liberal churches shouldn't agree to perform gay marriages unless and until they can fix the high suicide rate of trans ~~teachers~~ teenagers. It is a completely different problem.","5_1"

They didnt even interview a lot of those applicants. There is actually lower interview rate for Asians than Whites. How can you assign people a lower personal score that is supposed to be interview-based without even interviewing them?

Sure, Whites can challenge, but they didnt. Doesnt mean Asians cant challenge it. I dont know if Whites were discriminated, but that plays no role why Asians should NOT be discriminated.

Why did the lower court say no discrimination? Well, the whole reason that this is in the SCOTUS is because the lower court ruling is challenged to overturned, isnt it? And if it is, it means that the lower court ruling was either wrong, or the premise of the lower court ruling is wrong (probably the latter). 

You got the entire premise of the case wrong. The Asians that were discriminated arent talking about the White applicants nor the Black applicants. That is a second-degree order of a problem that Affirmative Action was suppose to resolve in principle. Which is why in the original post that I said the principle is fine. The challenge is that the current wording of Affirmative Action allows the execution of this principle VIA DISCRIMINATION of people groups BY RACE, and that should be illegal.

The fact that you started off by asking what if the Asian applicants really get lower scores in those areas is already showing that you know little about the case at all. The personal score is basically a score of how likable you are. Imagine if Asians are being replaced by Blacks here& It literally says that Blacks are less desirable and less likable by those in university admissions, and this was determined often based on applicant names (Wang, Kim, Zhang, Choi) or by their application race.
Its just that in this case, it wasnt Blacks that arent likable. Its Asians.","5_3_1"

I listened to the hearing live, and attorneys argued that the likability ratings were derived from references submitted with the applications. Aside from that, the attorneys barely mentioned the Asian students; at times, I forgot about the Asian students because, for hours, the justices and attorneys only talked about affirmative action, not about whether the Asian students were harmed. I dont see how low likability ratings are significant proof that affirmative action hurts only Asians, who are still admitted at higher rates than other minorities. 

I will not address all your rambling; the bottom line is even if Harvard and UNC discriminated against Asians, the discrimination would be worse without affirmative action because affirmative action benefits Asians, who are also minorities. 

Why do you think Harvard and UNC will make race-neutral criteria to admit more Asians if their goal is to discriminate against them?

Also, a lot of people do not understand affirmative action. Even with affirmative action, the holistic approach means that minorities must meet other criteria before considering race; race is not the only factor. So, the minorities admitted are still qualified and deserving of being accepted. 

Note: I disagree with discrimination but ending affirmative action is not the answer; the Asian applicants should have just sought relief from discrimination, not ending affirmative action, which would oppress Asians and minorities who are already oppressed.","5_3_1_1"

Indigenous identity in the US and Canada is extremely complex but to be reductive the question isnt what you look like, but more whether a tribe claims you or you are involved with that identity actively.

As far as I recall the way it works is that you put your race and if you put Native American theyll ask of what tribe and proof but then you can just put that youre for example Mayan, Mapuche, Inuit, etc and theyll consider that valid, they could still ask for proof but it can get a bit convoluted because Latin American countries dont have anything similar to the USs native reserves systems, so the best choice would be either a genetic test or proof that they lived in an indigenous village.

As I wrote in a previous comment:

Race-neutral practices or ending affirmative action does not mean discrimination will end. Most people have social media, interviews for admission to universities, names associated with race, zip codes associated with specific neighborhoods assumed to be dominated by certain races, and families' incomes could lead to discrimination. Or even excluding scores for exams like the SAT or GRE, which studies show is not an accurate measure of whether applicants would be successful in the first year at higher education institutions, could lead to discrimination. And universities could lower GPA requirements, too, and adversely impact certain races. It's so many ways discrimination can remain or worsen with race-neutral practices that hide discrimination.","19_2_1"

The case is at SCOTUS bc the lower courts also undertook the *Grutter/FisherI/FisherII* constitutional analysis of strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary."" *Fisher II* 136 SCt 2198 2208 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a university bears ""the ultimate burden of demonstrating that race-neutral alternatives...do not suffice. *Ibid*. Since strict scrutiny always imposes the ultimate burden-of-*persuasion* on the defendant, the plaintiffs' evidence didn't need to ""prove"" anything (assuming plaintiffs have an initial burden-of-*production* to begin with, &amp; they satisfy it). 

The current *Grutter* landscape may very well be 1 where plaintiffs did not adduce evidence to your or the lower courts' satisfaction. If so, plaintiffs requested that either SCOTUS overrule *Grutter* outright (ie diversity is too amorphous to be a compelling interest) OR (if *Grutter* survives) clarify that the lower courts misapplied *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. 

&gt;And yes, evidence does matter, the Supreme Court asked questions about simulations experts provided in lower courts and other matters regarding evidence.

""Evidence does 'matter,'"" but SCOTUS isn't in the business of error-correcting lower courts' math homework. You might be referring to several Justices asking about ""Simulation D,"" but SCOTUS isn't concerned w/ whether Simulation D is mathematically or scientifically sound. Instead, the constitutional question(s) before SCOTUS now is whether the lower courts correctly applied *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. Simulation D tends to show that a university-defendant opted against various race-neutral alternatives even tho those alternatives would produce entering classes about as racially diverse as race-based AA currently does (even if less diverse along other, non-constitutional dimensions (eg fewer legacies or oboe-players). If so, then arguably SCOTUS could find that the university-defendant failed to carry its *Fisher II ""*ultimate burden of demonstrating that race-neutral alternatives...do not suffice. *Ibid*.

**TL;DR** the cases aren't at SCOTUS so everyone can relitigate the ""statistical evidence"" of whether (eg) 15% or 20% is more accurate somewhere or whether Simulation B is in fact more realistic than Simulation D. Instead, SCOTUS is probing whether the lower courts correctly found that university-defendant(s) successfully carried their burden to satisfy *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. OR SCOTUS can overrule *Grutter* outright, which would by extension do away w/ the whole *Fisher* enterprise &amp; remand for the lower courts to conduct some new *SFFA v Harvard* (2023) strict scrutiny","19_3_1_1"

I know why Harvard and UNC's cases are at the Supreme Court; it was a rhetorical question because everyone knows it is not about whether the Asians were necessarily harmed but about affirmative action.

The supreme court decides whether the law applies to the facts evoking a particular law; in contrast, juries weigh facts. That is why the justice's questioning relied on what UNC and Harvard consider when reviewing applications. Grutter mandates that institutions not just consider race but also a holistic view of applicants. Grutter also requires that institutions consider other criteria before considering race. So it is undisputed in both cases that race is not the only factor that UNC and Harvard consider in admissions.

The cases are in SCOTUS to relitigate affirmative action, which is where my rhetorical question came about because all evidence shows that minorities are still disadvantaged despite affirmative action, blacks are disadvantaged the most, and whites are unaffected. And at institutions that use race-neutral criteria, whites remain unaffected. So, there is a race problem at UNC and Harvard, but it's not because of affirmative action. Therefore, I do not understand why SCOTUS is considering eliminating affirmative action to make discrimination against minorities easier.","19_3_1_1_1"

African Americans are about representative at Harvard - the school is 15.2% black and the US is 13.6% black.

Many people do not understand affirmative action. However, affirmative action aimed to protect minorities who were equally qualified based on merits and still denied admission.

Ivy League schools are funded primarily by billions of dollars from endowments from generations of wealth from white families, and white people dominate all Ivy League schools. And with or without affirmative action, white people still dominate.

The only reason why both cases are at the supreme court is that UNC and Harvard accept federal funding, so they must abide by affirmative action, which is a federal law. Without affirmative action, they could do different things to discriminate, like getting rid of federal funding or changing merit-based admissions to where GPA or test score requirements do not matter.

I know that you think because schools like Harvard only have limited slots, it accepts minorities who are not qualified at the expense of Asians. Still, that belief is racist because all applicants are equally qualified. But the point is Asians are minorities and benefit from affirmative action because, again, affirmative action aims to ensure that universities do not deny equally qualified applicants based on race.

There is a race problem at UNC and Harvard, but it is not because of affirmative action. And there is no such thing as color-blind anything here; historically, some Jews or biracial Americans who looked white engaged in passing, where they passed for white to get better opportunities. Those who passed for white would change their names and even abandon their families to live separate lives. Nowadays, that is difficult, if not impossible, because of technology.

Without affirmative action, schools couldnt use race to make decisions. They would have to decide people on other factors like gpa and test scores.

Also ridiculous to think all applicants are equally qualified. People have different strengths, different test scores, different grades, different activities, etc.

I dont think you have any idea what affirmative action does. Ending affirmative action would do what your last sentence says - get people treated based on their abilities and no their race. Race shouldnt be on applications and colleges should be banned from considering it.","42_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

The attorneys representing the Asian applicants admit that white people dominate because Harvard considers over forty measures when deciding what applicants are qualified. Those criteria include test scores, GPA, legacy admissions, children from wealthy families who donate, relatives of wealthy families, athletes, musicians, etc. So, race is not the only factor that makes applicants qualified.

So it would NOT matter if all the Asian applicants had higher test scores and GPAs than white people or other races; no matter what, they will never dominate all Ivy League schools. If anything, they had a better chance with affirmative action.

Because it is people who decide to discriminate even if they use laws to mistreat people.

For example, if we pretend that affirmative action is the problem, Harvard or any other school would not have to follow it because the Grutter case that the Supreme Court decided in 2003 mandates that all applicants are qualified holistically, not by just race. 

Without affirmative action, Ivy League schools that want to discriminate will have more accessible ways to discriminate with race-neutral criteria to hide behind discrimination because it will be up to the same schools that decide what criteria applicants must meet.","42_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

The Constitution is certainly very vague in a lot of area, but that was intentional. There are at least a couple of very valid and beneficial reasons for this I can think of off the top of my head, and I'm sure others could come up with more.

The first is practical. Imagine with as divisive as current politics are that we had to create an entirely new constitution from scratch and get 2/3 of the states to agree to it. How hard would it be to come up with a list of supreme laws that no other laws could contradict that that many states would agree to. That challenge was just as strong in 1787, and potentially even more so, than it is now. So from a practical perspective, keeping the language of the Constitution vague makes it more likely to get passed because people with different ideas can see their interpretation fitting under the language used. Yes, it means that you're going to have to argue and debate the meaning later, but it gives a starting point and gets something that can be agreed on.

The second is that the more definitely you list out the specifics, the more strongly you exclude whatever it is that you don't list. It's impossible to include every conceivable situation. So you can either keep things broad and hope that people use their judgment later to deal with situations as they arise, or you can list out specifics and, inevitably, create loopholes where you are powerless to do anything.

For Supreme Court Justices, it's not that Congress couldn't remove justices. The only thing the Constitution says (that I can think of off the top of my head) is ""in good behavior"" but what does that mean? There's a good argument that the bar for removing a justice isn't as high as the bar for removing the President, which includes a couple of specific cases plus high crimes and misdemeanors, because if it was the same bar then why wasn't the same language used? But it would be up to Congress to decide what that bar was and if they wanted to do something about it, and as divisive and partisan as we are that's clearly unlikely.","1_1_3_1"

I've quoted in other threads from Reinhardt's opinion declining to recuse himself when he sat on the panel considering California's Prop 8, which purported to ban same-sex marriage by amending the California constitution. (A decision which, by the way, was generally championed by liberal commentators, some of whom are now demanding Thomas' recusal).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The chief basis for the recusal motion appears to be my wifes beliefs, as expressed in her public statements and actions, both individually and in her capacity as Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California (ACLU/SC). She has held that position for 38 years, during 20 of which we have been married . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;My wifes views, public or private, as to any issues that may come before this court, constitutional or otherwise, are of no consequence. She is a strong, independent woman who has long fought for the principle, among others, that women should be evaluated on their own merits and not judged in any way by the deeds or position in life of their husbands (and vice versa). I share that view and, in my opinion, it reflects the status of the law generally, as well as the law of recusal, regardless of whether the spouse or the judge is the male or the female . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;Proponents contention that I should recuse myself due to my wifes opinions is based upon an outmoded conception of the relationship between spouses. When I joined this court in 1980 (well before my wife and I were married), the ethics rules promulgated by the Judicial Conference stated that judges should ensure that their wives not participate in politics. I wrote the ethics committee and suggested that this advice did not reflect the realities of modern marriagethat even if it were desirable for judges to control their wives, I did not know many judges who could actually do so (I further suggested that the Committee would do better to say spouses than wives, as by then we had as members of our court Judge Mary Schroeder, Judge Betty Fletcher, and Judge Dorothy Nelson). The committee thanked me for my letter and sometime later changed the rule. That time has passed, and rightly so. In 2011, my wife and I share many fundamental interests by virtue of our marriage, but her views regarding issues of public significance are her own, and cannot be imputed to me, no matter how prominently she expresses them. It is her view, and I agree, that she has the right to perform her professional duties without regard to whatever my views may be, and that I should do the same without regard to hers. Because my wife is an independent woman, I cannot accept Proponents position that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned under § 455(a) because of her opinions or the views of the organization she heads.

My own view is simply that whatever rule we adopt ought to apply in both liberal and conservative jurists' cases. I think Judge Reinhardt's rationale, expressed above, was generally correct in 2011, *a priori* more correct in 2022, but I can see the opposing argument.","2_1_2"

Long story short, there is little recourse or remedy if a justice does not recuse themselves when appropriate. No one reviews decisions of the supreme court. So there is basically no remedy, other than removal by impeachment, for not appropriately recusing oneself.

As an appellate court SCOTUS and the underling Circuit essentially have a frozen case with everything locked in - the facts stand as they were in the district court. If there were preserved objections made in the original case in regards to standing or disputes about the validity of the some of the claims, those can be examined, but if they weren't objected to at the time, they essentially become ""real""?

For instance, if defense counsel asks something which isnt relevant in cross-examination towards a witness which was crucial to the case, and you do not object to that question but later you believe that question to have influenced the jury then youve essentially waived your right to appeal since there was no original objection. Thats just an example and there are exclusions. 

When it comes to the fabricated evidence, SCOTUS is not a finder of fact and they are an appellate court so they do not try new evidence- this is the most important part to understand with the fabricated evidence. In this case, **in my opinion**, I believe defense counsel should have submitted as such to the SCOTUS, and SCOTUS *should have* waited until next term to finalize the case. The rest of the evidence presented to the courts should have been scrutinized by PAs and time should have been allowed to investigate this further, with possible additional trials.","2_7_1_2_1"

You have to prove both to prevail on a discrimination claim. Discriminatory intent is half the equation.

Thats not the problem for this new action. The problem is that Harvards most recent behavior  shows their intent has been to increase students of color. The idea that they are intentionally using legacy admissions to block applicants of color would have no credibility.","4_1_1_1_2_1"

What about *Griggs v. Duke Power* and the [Civil Rights Act of 1991](https://www.eeoc.gov/civil-rights-act-1991-original-text)?  Is there a distinction because we're talking about education instead of employment?","4_1_1_1_2_1_1"

But ""acknowledge"" just means ""disparate impact"" is mentioned in the statute or caselaw as playing *some* role.

But even then, it's far from the case disparate impact alone suffices to establish a statutory violation. Eg in T7 employment cases all that disparate impact does is satisfy the plaintiff's initial burden-of-*production* of making a *prima facie* case that then triggers a maze of *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting ping-ponging back &amp; forth btwn plaintiff &amp; defendant. But the ultimate burden-of-*persuasion* always falls on the plaintiff, &amp; eventually the plaintiff *will* have to prove discriminatory intent. Disparate impact might've allowed the plaintiff to reach the 50-yard line (or more like the 25-yard line), but disparate impact alone w/o accompanying proof of discriminatory intent won't successfully establish a T7 violation.

*However*, even tho Harvard is covered by Title VI(6) (also a statute like T7), AFAIK T6 jurisprudence hasn't evolved into its own well-defined field the same way T7 has. And if *SFFA* is any indication, T6 is still ""coterminous"" w/ 14A's Equal Protection Clause (EPC): T6 requires no more *but also no less* than the EPC, just as T6 was coterminous w/ the EPC 50 years ago in *Bakke*

If T6 still has the same requirements as the EPC, then Yes the EPC has unambiguously required discriminatory intent to prove EPC violations; disparate impact is neither necessary nor sufficient standing alone w/o discriminatory intent, since at least *Washington v Davis* (1976); *accord Arlington Heights* (1977)","4_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Obviously, there's some subjectivity where you split, but on any reasonable measure of that Berkeley is [extremely diverse.](https://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data-new-undergraduates)

&gt;Others depend on if you believe diversity means it should perfectly mirror the population demographics.

At that point, they are just defining diversity to be whatever they want it to mean (hence I sympathize with Thomas' ""I don't know what you mean by diversity"" line).

Under the normal definition (where ethnic diversity is supposed to somehow improve educational experience which seems irrelevant to population representation), UC mirroring the population demographics of CA 18 years olds would make it *less diverse* under the classifications Berkeley uses.  You would \~3x the population of Mexican Americans (already one of the larger groups at 14.8%), slightly raise the population of African Americans (3.4% to 7%) and drop the population of many smaller groups (Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Other Asian, South Asian, Vietnamese, and both Middle Eastern and non-Hispanic European if you disaggregate those from ""white"").

I suppose we can argue on the split, but I think it's intuitively obvious that the stronger students in the state (due to high meritocratic immigration into CA from the rest of the world) are generally more ethnically diverse than the less strong students (natives or 1st/2nds from the few countries with a lower immigration bar)","1_1_1_2_1_1"

It also wasn't just conservatives saying ""well this is fucky"", RBG wrote a concurrence to that opinion that was primarily about sunsetting affirmative action.

That country has seen some practical success using explicit quotas for OBC and SC and ST castes in politics and education, as well as with quotas for women in some local governments. 

Not that the Indian model hasnt had its issues (Cf. the rise of Hindu/Brahman quasi-nationalist party BJP).  Quotas would also be difficult to enact somewhere like the States, where there is no explicit, built-in constitutional provision for anything like OBCs.\*

But Piketty has an optimistic view of Indian quotas.  Particularly, he sees the Indian Supreme Courts constitutional permission to adjust caste-membership with an income requirement as a promising idea.  After [*Indra Sawhney*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra_Sawhney_%26_Others_v._Union_of_India), backward class members can be income-tested, and need not qualify for a quota spot if they test too high, in the creamy layer.  Piketty imagines this as a model to emulate for other countries: begin with explicit quotas, but set measurable targets for inclusion that trigger an automatic, gradual retreat from caste/race-based quotas into means-based quotas instead.

In the modern US it's a background assumption that of course breaking down race barriers is a good thing, but in India that's not so. [The prevailing attitude](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/attitudes-about-caste/) is that different castes should play nice together but are separate and should remain separate. So when you talk about a system of explicit racial reservations, Americans worry (I think reasonably) that this will tend to reify racial distinctions and make our ongoing efforts to break them down much more challenging. Do we really want a system where ""our family has traditionally mined coal in the Appalachians"" constitutes a distinct race?","13_1"

Piketty definitely worries about the problem of reifying (and calcifying) racial groups.  It is for this reason, for instance, that he seems to prefer the European census questions about parents and grandparents national origins over the American system of racial self-identification. 

His proposal is to begin with group-based quotas, as they may be the most direct way to deal with already-reified social groups.  In the case of the Indian caste system, the British reified their legal and administrative character, so there wasnt much initial danger in reifying the groups.  Given that castes had a real legal existence, it arguably made sense to begin undoing them along caste lines.  Similar arguments could be made for groups in other countries who were legally defined and then explicitly disadvantaged.  Blacks in the US, Indigenous people in Canada, Aborigines in Australia, etc. 

But as you point out, maintaining the legal categories just entrenches the grouping were ostensibly trying to eliminate.  So Piketty proposes that equality milestones be set up in advance.  As the milestones are passed, the quotas would reduce or change in pre-planned ways, turning group-based quotas into purely economic ones.","13_1_1"

So if even a relatively small number of total seats are 'reserved' for WASP legacy admissions, that would represent a substantial percentage of those seats reserved on a not-strictly-merit-based criteria where the beneficiaries are disproportionately white. (That could change years from now as the children of POC graduates come into their own legacy admissions, but that is a guess and it's just as hard to guess whether that would be a permanent change.)

That means fewer white, Jewish students can attain legacy status today compared to similarly-situated, white, non-Jewish students.

And today 7 out of 8 ivy league universities have jewish presidents. We can clearly see that jews are very well overrepresented at all levels in education and that no quotas against them exist anymore. People constantly parrot this supposed white overrepresentation that doesn't exist while completely ignoring that jews are extremely overrepresented both as students and in administrative positions and pretending that doesn't benefit jewish applicants. The entire notion of white privilege/overrepresentation crumbles once you stop counting jews as white in those statistics because jews make up as much as 25-50% of all white students in universities.","1_2_1_1_3_2_1"

Not true, sports is perhaps one of the the most meritocratic systems in existence. Your place in it is overwhelmingly determined by your ability than other external factors. 

Legacy admission isnt based on the merits of the applicant but on the relative who is a alumni of the university. 

&gt;You could say the same for the music charts with black artists.

Even in the corporate dominated music charts, where external influences such as advertisement and promotional campaigns, is still decidedly based on the merits of the individual artist. 

Even when nepotism, which legacy admission is in the academic realm, allows outsized exposure and influence. It is the market and consumers that make the ultimate decision on if someone succeeds.

Contrast that with academic institutions, getting your foot in the door is merely enough, as even a pedestrian passing GPA is enough to give the graduate access to professional opportunities not available to others that has not attended the same institution, this is also amplified when considering the impact of college fraternities and sororities. 

These impact continued till the end of the persons life, allowing doors to be opened at all stages of life, something an artist cannot claim as the vast majority of artists fall out of fame and is replaced. 

This is simply isnt a equal comparison at all.

&gt;How can race be used as the only metric, when there are more poor white people than black people?

You are taking the wrong sample size, you are comparing the overall general population of the United States when that isnt what you should be focused on.

The focus sample should be what is the overall general population of college students and those numbers reflect an over representation of white students vs minorities.

Where the legacy begins when the school is segregated by law, then there's an argument to made that the legacy is based on race. The scenario is not at all far-fetched, as many applicants apply to the alma mater of their grandparents. Many of today's applicants are the grandchildren of people who graduated in the early 1960s, when many southern schools were segregated by law. Consequently, in that scenario legacy admission is only available to applicants of white grandparents. Ironically, that does not mean that that the applicant must be white.","1_6"

With a wide and loyal alumni network, Notre Dame historically has had a high percentage of alumni children attend the University. Bishop estimated that between 19% and 25% of each class consists of alumni children, varying year to year. He expects about 18% to 19% of the incoming first-year class to be legacy admits.

Compared to other selective private institutions, Notre Dames proportion of alumni students outweighs its peers. Ivy League schools average about 11.5% of alumni children per each class, while the top-20 non-Ivy League private universities average 7.5%, Bishop said.

He attributed the high rate of legacy students at Notre Dame to the family-oriented and Catholic nature of the University.

We are more likely to be married and we have more children. Were just more family-oriented, and again, thats the nature of Notre Dame, Bishop said.","13"

As Justice Jackson notes multiple times in her dissent, the policies in question use race as a subset of one among many factors as part of a holistic assessment of individual applicants. The majority, and particularly Thomas's concurrence, vastly overstate the extent to which racial considerations are involved in university admissions. The majority also claims to not be overruling former cases like Bakke, Grutter, and Fisher while clearly rejecting those precedents and striking down any meaningful consideration of race in college admissions.

The idea is that in order to make the race fair you have to assist those who youve harmed until you eliminate the disadvantage, and once youve accomplished that goal, its fair to proceed without weights for anyone.

But affirmative action does not fix the consequences of prior discrimination. Universities give the same affirmative action preferential treatment to black applicants who are recent immigrants from Africa, or elsewhere, or even the children of the ultra privileged (like Barack Obamas daughters) as they do to black applicants who are actually descended from slaves or from families harmed by Jim Crow. 

Conversely, what have Asian-Americans done to deserve being penalised? What historical injustice is being corrected by demanding they score several hundred SAT points higher on average than white applicants?

This actually makes me more inclined to support affirmative action since I dont believe it is a childs fault for being born into a family that doesnt emphasis the admissions game.  However, I still think the best thing to would be (a) open more slots.  No reason to keep student populations artificially low if there are qualified students ready and willing to go.  And/or (B) use a system that IDs situations that should have a greater or lesser weight placed on it for evaluation.  For example,  a student working full time from a one parent household that has a 2.0 GPA but scores a 1500+ on the SAT may be just as prepared as a student from prep school with a 4.0 from grade inflation and 1450 SAT score after taking it 3 times.  I think one way or another people are not comfortable using race as a criteria in any capacity.

I also have to push back on your ""elevate descendants of slaves"" a bit.  You're talking about economic mobility, yet less than a third of African Americans go to college under our current AA system, compared to about 47% for whites and even higher for Asians.

Yes. For the individual applicant, AA determines *which* school a student will attend, not whether they pursue higher education at all.

""[N]o evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans whatsoever"", the district court said. That was after four years of discovery in which all applications could be reviewed at will. And that explicitly included the ""personal rating"" that the conservative justices touted as conclusive proof of improper discrimination at oral argument.

Put differently, the people most invested in and vocal about overturning affirmative action have, since its inception, been white people. They have not suddenly cracked the code, legally speaking, or discovered some new smoking gun by making Asian-Americans the face of their challenges to affirmative action. There has been no groundbreaking development that actually justifies jettisoning decades of SCOTUS precedent - as proven and underscored by the fact that on a full factual record, the lower courts concluded that *there is no discrimination against Asian-Americans here.* What *has* changed is that when Ginsburg died and Barrett replaced her, suddenly the ideological balance shifted, and the five hard-right justices comprised a majority rather than relying on Roberts as a swing vote. That's it. That's all. Like Dobbs, like Bruen, like Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, it is purely judicial fiat: ""now we, radical conservatives, have the power to reject precedents we don't like in favor of imposing our policy preferences, so we're going to do that."" 

So yes, SFFA will probably win. But it won't be because they made a compelling case that the precedents are wrong, it won't be because they established discrimination against Asian-Americans, and it won't be because the conservatives steering this give two shits about racial diversity for Asian-Americans or anyone else.

Here's the 1st Circuit summarizing the trial court's findings

&gt;[Harvard's process does not weigh race so heavily 
that it becomes mechanical and decisive in practice [....] The Supreme Court has also approved admissions programs where race has a larger effect on a student's chances of admission than Harvard's use of race [....] The 
outcomes of Harvard's admissions process do not indicate that race is impermissibly ""'decisive.'""](http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/19-2005P-01A.pdf)

Somewhere along the line people got this all confused. Two things can be true:

1.) Harvard discriminates based on race, and their admissions policy will be (and has been) evaluated based on strict scrutiny because it discriminates based on applicants' race. 

2.) Harvard's admissions policy, even though it discriminates, may still be legal under *Grutter* and *Fisher* if it withstands scrutiny by furthering the ""compelling"" interest in diversity.

The 1st Circuit was so blunt as to say even if Harvard ""considers race at virtually every step of its admission process"" then Harvard would still win under the 1st Circuit's interpretation of *Fischer*. 

The petitioners didn't lose because they couldn't prove Harvard discriminates. It's simple science that the trial court and 1st Circuit briefly mentions: 

&gt;if the personal rating is included, as done by Harvard's expert, being Asian American has a statistically insignificant effect on an applicant's chance of admission. If the personal rating is excluded, as done by SFFA's expert, it shows that being Asian American has a statistically significant37 negative effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard. 

They proved what Harvard found out in the 1990 OCR Report that, as the district court acknowledged, ""found recurring characterizations of Asian American applicants that were broadly consistent with stereotypes."" 

However under our caselaw it hardly matters that some petitioners prove that a university uses race since *Fischer* says race can be used. It just doesn't matter that being Asian American has a ""statistically significant negative effect.""

Jesus, this post is blindingly dishonest. The key point is here, where you falsely conflate the fact that the trial court recognized Harvard *considers* race, as opposed to being race-blind - which as you generously concede is entirely permissible under established law on how race works in college admissions - with a finding that Harvard committed racial discrimination.  They are completely different things, and I think you know that.

SFFA lost before the district court.  After full discovery, motion practice, a fifteen-day bench trial, and mountains of expert evidence, the district court concluded that SFFA had failed to show intentional discrimination by Harvard.  Here are some choice quotes from the district court opinion, which is at 397 F.Supp.3d 126 for anyone with a Westlaw or Lexis subscription.

&gt;In the instant case, the admissions officers who testified at trial uniformly asserted that they do not and have not directly considered race in assigning ratings, other than the overall rating. The Court credits the admissions officers' testimony and concludes that Harvard has made clear to its admissions officers in more recent years that they should not use race in assigning the profile ratings.

&gt;In sum, comments on application files and Admissions Office correspondence do not suggest any pervasive bias against Asian Americans among Harvard's admissions officers or its admissions leadership, nor has the Court identified any individual applicant whom it can determine was discriminated against or intentionally stereotyped by an admissions officer, including by the use of the words ""standard strong."" [a term for applicants who were strong candidates, but didn't stand out given the overall strength of Harvard's applicant pool]

&gt;Professor Arcidiacono acknowledges that Asian American ALDCs are not discriminated against. See Oct. 25 Tr. 120:23-126:8. His corresponding suggestion that only non-ALDC Asian Americans face discrimination in the admissions process is inadequately supported by non-statistical evidence. Further, it does not seem likely that Harvard would discriminate against non-ALDC Asian Americans, but not discriminate against ALDC Asian American applicants or that there would be a race-related explanation for treating the two groups differently, especially given the Court's conclusion based on the testimony of Harvard's admission officers that any race-related discrimination against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants is unintentional.

&gt;Whether the personal rating variable is included [in statistical models] or not, the lower probability of admission to Harvard that appears associated with Asian American identity is slight, with an average marginal effect of Asian American racial identity on admissions probability that is well below minus one percentage point (i.e. closer to zero). The model does not demonstrate any intent by admissions officers to discriminate based on racial identity, and the implied effect is so slight that it is possible that the coefficient would be positive [i.e. that Asian-Americans received *better* results, all else equal], at least with the personal rating included, if the model was better able to account for unobserved factors.

&gt;the Court sees no evidence of discrimination in the personal ratings save for the slight numerical disparity itself. The statistical disparity is relatively minor and can be at least partially explained by a variety of factors including race-correlated inputs to the rating such as teacher and guidance counselor recommendations. Just as the Court cannot explain the variations in the academic and extracurricular ratings, it cannot definitively explain the difference in the personal ratings, but it finds that the disparity is small and reflects neither intentional discrimination against Asian American applicants nor a process that was insufficiently tailored to avoid the potential for unintended discrimination.

&gt; Even if there is an unwarranted disparity in the personal ratings, the Court is unable to identify any individual applicant whose admissions decision was affected and finds that the disparity in the personal ratings did not burden Asian American applicants significantly more than Harvard's race-conscious policies burdened white applicants. Further, there is no evidence of any discriminatory animus or conscious prejudice. To the contrary, certain statistics can be interpreted to suggest that Harvard's admissions process unintentionally favored some subsets of Asian Americans, including the ALDCs and certain other discrete demographic groups like disadvantaged Asian females. The most likely causes of these statistical findings, however, is random variation in the admissions process or omitted variable biases, not selective discrimination that favored some Asian Americans and disfavored others.

&gt;Further, throughout this trial, SFFA did not present a single admissions file that reflected any discriminatory animus, or even an application of an Asian American who it contended should have or would have been admitted absent an unfairly deflated personal rating. There thus remains the distinct possibility that a review of the available applications did not turn up a rejected Asian American applicant who was clearly more qualified than the white applicants who were admitted, or an applicant who received an obviously unjustified personal rating. This would strongly suggest that Asian American applicants were not discriminated against relative to white applicants and were therefore not unduly burdened by Harvard's admissions program.

&gt;a few identified imperfections, after years of litigating and sifting through applications and metrics, do not alone require a finding that Harvard's admissions program is not narrowly tailored.

&gt;For purposes of this case, at least for now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race conscious admissions. Harvard's admission program passes constitutional muster in that it satisfies the dictates of strict scrutiny.

These are not cherry-picking. These are not taking things out of context. They are the core of the opinion. 

Whereas you, for instance, quote a passage from the First Circuit that literally says nothing more significant than Harvards experts model doesnt show any effect on Asian-Americans, SFFAs experts model does because a significant variable was excluded, and you tout it as somehow being proof that SFFA successfully established discrimination.  Despite the fact that this passage is (1) nothing more than a really boring and obvious statement to the effect that each side presented expert evidence that favored their arguments, (2) a recitation of the parties arguments rather than any kind of finding about who was right, and (3) was done immediately before explaining why the better analysis was Harvards rather than SFFAs.  

&gt;They proved what Harvard found out in the 1990 OCR Report that, as the district court acknowledged, ""found recurring characterizations of Asian American applicants that were broadly consistent with stereotypes."" 

In the previous breath from what youre quoting, the district court pointed out that ""The OCR Report reached an 'overall conclusion that Harvard did not discriminate against Asian American applicants to its undergraduate program in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act[.]'"" Yes, the OCR Report found some troubling actions.  But you cannot paper over the basic fact that it, just like the district court, ultimately concluded the exact opposite of what youre implying it did.

Ill use a simple example. If a court issues a decision saying, ""the plaintiff put forward some probative evidence suggesting that defendant may have committed fraud, but after weighing that evidence in light of the overall factual record, this Court concludes that the plaintiff failed to prove fraud,"" *you don't get to go around quoting the first half and claiming the district court actually found proof that fraud occurred.*

The SFFA lost comprehensively at the district court level, on every count. The best that can be said is that their expert made a good effort of it. The First Circuit confirmed that loss at the circuit level.  Your attempt to claim that *actually* the SFFA proved Harvard discriminated, but lost anyway because our precedents don't care about anti-Asian discrimination or something, is a complete lie. Do better.","3_3_3_1_1"

Which is true, but the question was whether there was any discrimination at Harvard. In the screed I responded to, they at one point go as far to say

&gt;And that explicitly included the ""personal rating"" that the conservative justices touted as conclusive proof of improper discrimination at oral argument.

And that's... Just not true. The plaintiffs' model that the trial court credits does make a huge difference. I quoted it. [All it does it yank the personal score, which the trial court also credits.](https://i.redd.it/nbe5raxpwcx91.png)

But it's never going to be enough under *Grutter*. Plaintiffs need ""animus,"" or what the trial court sometimes calls ""intentional"" discrimination. 

Harvard *the institution* did not intend to discriminate against Asian Americans, it ""intended"" to create a diverse environment.

However, there was the unintended effect of creating the tools that allowed people to deliberately ding Asian Americans on the basis of race. In other words, discrimination. The type of classic discrimination that companies face all the time under provisions of the Civil Rights Act

You quote it yourself

&gt;Just as the Court cannot explain the variations in the academic and extracurricular ratings, it cannot definitively explain the difference in the personal ratings, but it finds that the disparity is small and reflects neither intentional discrimination against Asian American applicants nor a process that was insufficiently tailored to avoid the potential for unintended discrimination.

Done, Harvard ""the process"" discriminated and there's the proof. The Court has no explanation and it's obvious why. 

The Court didn't have to explain Harvard's failing under *Fisher.* It could simply credit that the personal ratings were racially biased against Asian Americans \~and\~ that there wasn't animus in the outcome of a ""diverse"" student body.

There's like a mental gap people have where there can't be a moral gray area, that Harvard simply couldn't have done this when... They clearly did fuck up","3_3_3_1_1_1"

Considering race is not discrimination.

The statistically significant negative overall average marginal effect of Asian American identity in SFFA' preferred model is also not robust.44 In addition to disappearing entirely when the personal rating is included in the model, it is almost undetectable on a year-by-year basis even within SFFA's preferred model.

&gt;[But what we can say with respect to the allegation of discrimination in this case, which was the -- the -- the definition of discrimination that was at issue in Bakke and Grutter and Fisher and which their expert, which their lawyer got up at opening statement and said: When we talk about discrimination in this case, we're talking about discrimination in admissions outcomes.](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2022/20-1199_6537.pdf)

In other words, to Harvard there's two types of discrimination.

1.) Discrimination against applicants, which is probably fine. It's essentially irrelevant because of the second type;

2.) Discrimination to ""Outcome."" 

So Harvard can (and has) made a process that discriminates against Asian Americans and is racist et al. But there's still this gap that applicants have to prove that the ""outcome"" is actually discriminatory. The applicants can't prove the outcome is discriminatory because the outcome is diversity within Harvard

So the applicants can shout until they're blue in the face about substantial discrimination, but if *Fischer* says the goal of diversity is so compelling it can overcome strict scrutiny then... As far as Harvard is concerned, it just sucks to be Asian American at Harvard

Are these just artifacts? Well, the trial courts speculates, probably not. 

&gt;Harvards ratings at the margins, to the extent that the disparities are the result of race, they are unintentional and would not be cured by a judicial dictate that Harvard abandon considerations of race in its admission process.

The Court concluded there was an effect. It eventually concluded it wasn't ""undue burden,"" whatever that means, but what I think they were trying to get at is whether it could be balanced against Harvard's compelling interest. In the end they decided it could be as there was no better alternative than discriminating against Asian Americans.

The remaining issue is whether Harvards admissions program unduly burdens Asian American applicants. Based on Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating included, there is not a statistically significant difference between the chances of admission for similarly situated Asian American and white applicants. Under this rubric, the lack of a statistically significant penalty against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants suggests that the burden Harvards race-conscious admissions policy places on Asian American applicants is not undue. However, Professor Arcidiaconos analysis, and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating excluded, imply that Asian American applicants are disadvantaged relative to white applicants. The questions in the context of this case then become: why do Asian American applicants score lower on the personal rating, does it unfairly affect their chances of admission, and if so, is this an undue burden on them when measured against Harvards compelling interest in diversity?

So considered and found not to be discriminatory.

This logistic regression model showed that there was a negative correlation between an applicant's personal rating and Asian American identity even when controlling for various factors related to admission.

There you have it. You quoted it.

The Court *cannot explain* the difference without resorting to references to ""unintentional"" discrimination. 

That's the money shot. Case closed. Harvard discriminates. However, the Court needed more from applicants. It's not enough Harvard discriminated. As in, the actions to discriminate were intentional and the discrimination was conscious and systematic, but that wasn't the goal. 

Harvard made a process to get to ""outcome"" diversity. The intentional goal was outcome diversity. The unintentional result was discrimination against Asian American applicants. 

But on the question of, ""can we explain Asian Americans personal score without racism?"" The answer is, as the trial court explains, no.

There was no discrimination against Asians found in the lower courts.

There is no circuit split.  

And no, racism in America is not over.

The playing field is not level and colorblind meritocracy is a dream they sell that has never existed and never will.

The argument of SFRA is based on correlation, not causation, and I have no doubt the judgment of this court will be one of naked power that will be based on feels and not facts.  (Footnote 38 in the appeal is illuminating)","3_4"

Im sorry, but that is shockingly racist. The judges comments were disgusting.

"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/yj6z4k/the_supreme_court_has_no_reason_to_end/","marzenmangler","2022-11-01",1667337364,-10,-10,0,0,"So youre referring to the trial court and heres the entire quote:

The remaining issue is whether Harvards admissions program unduly burdens Asian American applicants. Based on Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating included, there is not a statistically significant difference between the chances of admission for similarly situated Asian American and white applicants. Under this rubric, the lack of a statistically significant penalty against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants suggests that the burden Harvards race-conscious admissions policy places on Asian American applicants is not undue. However, Professor Arcidiaconos analysis, and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating excluded, imply that Asian American applicants are disadvantaged relative to white applicants. The questions in the context of this case then become: why do Asian American applicants score lower on the personal rating, does it unfairly affect their chances of admission, and if so, is this an undue burden on them when measured against Harvards compelling interest in diversity?
It is possible that the self-selected group of Asian Americans that applied to Harvard during the years included in the data set used in this case did not possess the personal qualities that Harvard is looking for at the same rate as white applicants, just as it is possible that the self- selected white applicants tend to have somewhat weaker academic qualifications than Asian
American applicants. In other words, assuming Asian American and white applicants have the same academic and extracurricular potential and the same quality of personal attributes as demographic groups, it could be that asymmetric portions of each of these groups apply to Harvard. This would explain why Asian American applicants to Harvard did better than white applicants on the academic and extracurricular ratings and why white applicants to Harvard did better on the personal rating despite the likelihood that Asian Americans are not inherently more intelligent and white applicants are not inherently more personable. This scenario has little evidentiary support, but it, like Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model including the personal ratings, would result in a finding of no undue burden and a narrowly tailored process that satisfied strict scrutiny.59
Alternatively, it may be that there is overt discrimination or implicit bias at work to the disadvantage of Asian American applicants. To begin at the end, the Court sees no evidence of discrimination in the personal ratings save for the slight numerical disparity itself. The statistical disparity is relatively minor and can be at least partially explained by a variety of factors including race-correlated inputs to the rating such as teacher and guidance counselor recommendations. Just as the Court cannot explain the variations in the academic and extracurricular ratings, it cannot definitively explain the difference in the personal ratings, but it
finds that the disparity is small and reflects neither intentional discrimination against Asian American applicants nor a process that was insufficiently tailored to avoid the potential for unintended discrimination.
Even if there is an unwarranted disparity in the personal ratings, the Court is unable to identify any individual applicant whose admissions decision was affected and finds that the disparity in the personal ratings did not burden Asian American applicants significantly more than Harvards race-conscious policies burdened white applicants. Further, there is no evidence of any discriminatory animus or conscious prejudice. To the contrary, certain statistics can be interpreted to suggest that Harvards admissions process unintentionally favored some subsets of Asian Americans, including the ALDCs and certain other discrete demographic groups like disadvantaged Asian females. The most likely causes of these statistical findings, however, is random variation in the admissions process or omitted variable biases, not selective discrimination that favored some Asian Americans and disfavored others.

Footnote on that:

There may be little evidentiary support for this hypothesis because it was not in the interest of either party to develop this scenario. SFFA was wedded to the idea that the Asian American applicants were superior in two profiles and discriminated against on a third, while Harvard was unwilling to overtly argue that Asian American applicants were actually weaker in personal criteria, notwithstanding their stronger average academic performance and Harvards acknowledgment that Asian American applicants tend to be stronger in their extracurricular pursuits. The Court does not think, however, that demonstrable, disproportionate strength of a racial group in one area necessarily implies that the same racial group should be strong in all areas. If one assumes that raw talent and race are unrelated, it would be unsurprising to find that applicants that excel in one area, tend to be somewhat weaker in other areas.

And from the appeal:

Footnote 38:
SFFA implies throughout its brief that to see a negative correlation between Harvard's personal rating and Asian American ethnicity and not attribute it to racial bias is to conclude that ""maybe the stereotypes about Asian Americans are true."" This is a false dichotomy. SFFA ignores the possibility that factors external to Harvard's admissions process but correlated with race could account for the racial disparity in personal ratings.
Racial differences in Harvard's other ratings help illustrate SFFA's logical error. For example, Asian Americans do better than any other racial group on Harvard's academic rating. No one looks at this correlation and concludes that there are only two possibilities: either Asian American students are smarter than everyone else or Harvard thinks they are and assigns them higher ratings accordingly. Instead, it is more likely that factors external to Harvard's admissions process but correlated with race account for Asian American's higher academic ratings. For this reason, everyone agreed that Harvard's academic rating should remain in the logistic regression model even though Professor Arcidiacono showed that -- even when controlling for obvious variables like grades and test scores and other factors like demographics, parental education, geographic region, and characteristics of applicants' high schools -- there is a positive correlation between Asian American identity and Harvard's academic rating. Indeed, when asked what could account for the statistical relationship between the academic rating and race even when controlling for other factors, Professor Arcidiacono replied: ""We don't think it's because of race. We think it's because of these unobservable factors.""

Eg, you write ""\[t\]here was no discrimination against Asians found in the lower courts."" The 1st Cir. opinion you linked actually describes the trial court's decision as follows:

&gt;The model including the personal rating showed that Asian American identity has no statistically significant effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard. The model excluding the personal rating showed that Asian American identity had a slightly negative effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard.  
&gt;  
&gt;The district court found the statistical evidence ""inconclusive"" and held that it did ""not demonstrate any intent by admissions officers to discriminate based on racial identity."" \[I\]t held that there was no *intentional* discrimination.

*SFFA v. Harvard*, 980 F.3d 157, 182 (1st Cir. 2020) (emphasis added).

1. Most laypeople (even here on r|law) use ""discrimination"" in the statistical sense, &amp; on this score the D.Mass &amp; the 1st Cir. opinions both ""found the statistical evidence '*inconclusive*.'"" *Id* (emphasis added). Hence, it's simply not the case that either court found there was definitively, absolutely, no statistical discrimination whatsoever. The most it could say was that the statistical evidence was ""inconclusive"" btwn ""no statistically significant effect"" &amp; ""a slightly negative effect,"" depending on whether you include the Personal Rating.
   1. For most people, a ""slightly negative effect"" counts as ""discrimination.""
   2. In most other contexts (eg police traffic stops), there'd be much greater reluctance to read ""inconclusive"" to mean ""absolutely no discrimination"";
      1. ie to interpret ambiguity so as to award the benefit of the doubt to the alleged discriminator
2. Even if there had been some ""discrimination"" (however defined), still the courts cannot &amp; did not end their inquiry there. To trigger Title VI liability or violate Equal Protection, the discrimination must also have been ""intentional"" in the *Washington v. Davis* sense.
   1. And that's what exactly the district court &amp; 1st Cir found: no *intentional* discrimination, *not* no discrimination whatsoever.
3. The 1st Cir was obv applying an ""abuse-of-discretion"" standard-of-review, where it upholds D.Mass's findings unless ""clearly erroneous.""
4. For most observers, whether laypeople or lawyers, for or against, the ""statistical evidence"" flying back &amp; forth is too dense to analyze.
   1. Most importantly, laypeople &amp; lawyers--both for &amp; against--care far more about *not* a) whether the courts correctly weighed the statistical evidence (which indeed enjoys an abuse-of-discretion review), but instead b) whether the courts correctly applied *Grutter/Fisher* strict scrutiny (properly understood) to Harvard/UNC.
      1. Hence why it's even @ SCOTUS in the 1st place: SFFA sought cert on &amp; SCOTUS granted cert on the constitutional strict scrutiny analysis.
      2. SFFA didn't ask for SCOTUS to error-correct the 1st Cir's math homework, which I doubt SCOTUS ever would--or could--grant cert on
      3. Notably, no court below SCOTUS is entitled to any deference, whether ""abuse-of-discretion"" or otherwise, regarding how they conducted strict-scrutiny constitutional analysis.

Findings of the trial court start on 123 so feel free to explore.

The testimony of the admissions officers that there was no discrimination against Asian American applicants with respect to the admissions process as a whole and the personal ratings in particular was consistent, unambiguous, and convincing. Not one of them had seen or heard anything disparaging about an Asian American applicant despite the fact that decisions were made collectively and after open discussion about each applicant in the docket and full committee meetings. Similarly, there is no credible evidence that corroborates the improper
discrimination suggested by Professor Arcidiaconos statistical model

Finally, SFFA did not present a single Asian American applicant who was overtly discriminated against or who was better qualified than an admitted white applicant when considering the full range of factors that Harvard values in its admissions process.","3_4_2_1"

Harvard*, 980 F.3d 157, 181-82 (1st Cir. 2020); 2) the ultimate question of whether that discrimination, if any, was ""intentional"" for *Washington v. Davis* purposes.

You, on the other hand, pointed to a quotation (w/ no pincite, but w/e) on Pg#125 of your linked PDF of D.Mass's opinion about how the district court credited ""*the testimony* *of the \[defendants\]* that there was no discrimination."" 397 F. Supp. 3d 126, 203 (D. Mass. 2019) (emphasis added). If you're conflating the (naturally tendentious) ""testimony of the \[defendants\]"" w/ the district court's own factual determinations of the (pen)ultimate question(s) of whether there was 1) discrimination &amp; 2) whether the discrimination--if any--was intentional, then r|politics might really have been the more appropriate subreddit. I suppose I had assumed (mistakenly) that r|law can at least discern the difference btwn i) a district court's own factual findings on (pen)ultimate question(s) &amp; 2) a district court describing defendants' testimony that there was no discrimination as conclusive ""proof"" that there was indeed no discrimination"" as if the district court just said ""I'll take your word for it, bro.""

&gt;And SCOTUS is required to give deference to the trier of fact, although this court tends to forget that.

Insofar as ""SCOTUS is required to give deference to the trier of fact,"" that deference is limited to *findings-of-fact* (eg ""the stoplight was red""), not wholesale deference to literally anything &amp; everything in the factfinder's opinion. Importantly, a district court purporting to undertake the constitutional analysis of strict scrutiny is *not* engaged in any ""factfinding"" but is instead resolving ""questions-of-law,"" &amp; it's well-settled that appellate court(s) (eg 1st. Cir &amp; SCOTUS) owe no ""deference to the trier of fact"" on such ""questions-of-law.""","3_4_2_1_1"

The statistics and the analysis of those statistics by the experts at trial are facts.  So youre splitting hairs at best there.

And contrary to your assertion, the district courts findings as to the testimony of a witness is, again, an instance of facts.

The trial courts impression of the witnesses testimony is also something that SCOTUS is supposed to respect because the finder of fact is in the best position to evaluate it.

So yes, the fact that the witnesses who testified, credibly per the trial court, that there was no discrimination is also a fact in the record.  No conflation needed.  Witness testimony and credibility of those witnesses are facts on the record from the trial court.

The trial court found no discrimination.  Either did the appellate court who also found no mistakes of law.

I hadn't realized that you could just establish your own comments as inconvertibly ""right"" merely by asserting you're right.

Yes, you're ""right"" that appellate courts generally defer to factfinders' *findings-of-fact*, but appellate courts review factfinders ""questions-of-law"" (eg whether UNC ultimately satisfies strict scrutiny) *de novo* (ie no deference at all).

&gt;The trial courts impression of the witnesses testimony is also something that SCOTUS is supposed to respect because the finder of fact is in the best position to evaluate it.

No SCOTUS Justice--liberal or conservative--spent even a second asking about witness credibility. If SCOTUS reverses D.Mass and/or 1st Cir., I *guarantee* you it'll be on constitutional grounds rather than SCOTUS interpreting the factual record in a way contrary to D.Mass's ""factual findings.""

Ie those constitutional grounds could implicate some or all of strict scrutiny (narrow tailoring and/or diversity as a compelling interest) or an outright overruling of *Grutter.*

Which, btw, I note none of your comments have anything to do w/ constitutional concepts like ""strict scrutiny"" or ""narrow tailoring,"" even tho all the SCOTUS Justices spent 99% of yesterday's oral arguments asking about the constitutional issues but basically 0% shoring up or casting doubt on D.Mass's ""factual findings,"" which definitely does *not* encompass questions-of-law such as whether race-based AA is ""narrowly tailored.""

The 14th amendment requires equal protections under the law. It seems fairly clear that this implies a ban on racial discrimination, but defenders of affirmative action seem to argue that ""well actually the people who wrote it meant something else, and supported racial discrimination"". Personally I think originalist arguments are dubious in and of themselves, but that is different issue.

The Civil Rights Act on the other hand explicitly bans racial discrimination. Affirmative action as practiced by Harvard and UNC is - quite explicitly - racial discrimination: it involves choosing between applicants based on their skin colour, disadvantaging applicants with of ""undesirable"" race. Therefore it is illegal.

The idea that the court can somehow just ignore this because ""we really want racial quotas"" (which is what they mean by ""diversity"") is just ridiculous.

This slate piece includes the line:

""Racial discrimination in housing, education, and many other aspects of American life persist""

- I think its a complex issue that doesnt have a clear answer. I do think theres bias going on, but I think the root of affirmative action, especially at the school level, comes from a place of good and wanting to give downtrodden groups an equal chance. This instance seems sloppily applied.

- I equate it more to racial bias in AI applications. AI isnt maliciously racist, there are pieces of data in the system and patterns that cause bias.

- I also believe Im acknowledgement that people in life have it harder than I do based on their skin color. And I know that over history, African Americans have been denied the chance to build equity over and over again, and when they have, it has sometimes been destroyed. For example, they were excluded from the GI Bill, which helped to build a lot of the post WW2 middle class wealth in America.

- We should also acknowledge that AA has also helped people?

- Im a white middle class man who has all the advantages, so I feel very poorly equipped to talk about the subject.

- My persona feeling is that I also dont have a lot of sympathy for the plaintiff: he couldnt get into Harvard so he had to settle for his 2nd choice, Berkeley. Boo hoo.

- I also want to research the guy who has been bankrolling this effort to overturn affirmative action. Why? Whats his motivation?

First, education is more than the classroom.  Introducing diversity - economic and racial - into the classroom, particularly in liberal arts fields, provides a different perspective (its less impactful in STEM, because there is more objectivity in those fields). Take two hypothetical prospective students who had a parent serve in Afghanistan or Iraq. The child of the supply officer who did not go out on patrols and basically was in a warehouse in another country is going to have a very different experience from the child of the private who was actively involved in combat and who witnessed losing friends in combat and taking the life of others. 

Now, translate that to a classroom discussion on the effects of what happened in Afghanistan. Both will have things to add to the conversation with the children of those who did not serve. 

Its similar for race. I can vividly recall a discussion in college (more than 30 years ago) where a friend of mine discussed the racism that he faced growing up, and how he - and his family/friends - viewed the reconstruction period. I can recall another discussion with a classmate about how the racism that she received in the south (she was from Atlanta) was different than the kind of racism she received on the west coast (where we were in school). I learned more about how racism exists in those two discussions than I could have in a number of lectures or books on the issue.

Its also similar for economics. My best friend in college (and my freshman year roommate) came far far more economically disadvantaged backgrounds than I did. I was a upper middle class suburban kid whose parents were still married. My dad ran a small business, and my mom My roommate was a rural kid whose dad was a logger, and whose mom was a social worker. They were divorced - and had an acrimonious relationship. My best friends parents married right out of high school, and neither of them had any formal education beyond high school (my friend was the second person in his family to go to college - his older sister was first). We all learned much more about life from each other than we did in class - and isn't that the purpose of an education?

Second, who is more deserving of an elite education - the person who has the way paved for them, or the person who has to pave their own way? You can use race and economic background as a shorthand for either of those. Most people who wind up in elite universities grow up in a relatively homogenous community where the previous generation also went to college, and are economically middle/upper middle/professional (Doctor, Lawyer, etc.) class. Their parents have paved the way for them, and are able to do the ""little things"" to help their academics, from being able to explain/teach issues that the child is struggling with, to being able to obtain tutoring for subjects and for test taking on the standardized tests. 

Third - for good or bad, admissions is based on what they think you will accomplish for a whole variety of reasons that have nothing to do with your test scores or GPA. GPA's are hugely inflated, and some high schools are far more inflated than others (and over time as well). Leadership in HS typically means leadership in and after college. That makes the alumni more prestigious, which raises the profile of the university, which means going forward, a higher level of applicant.","13_2_3_2"

The 14th amendment demands equal protection under the law and thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of race. The Civil Rights Act explicitly prohibits discrimination of the basis of race.

One of the justices brought up the question of standing - i.e. she asked who was specifically harmed by the current policies of race being factored into admissions decisions.

If a lower court declared that there was no evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans, does this mean that the SFFA lawyer can not in any way mention the Asian American plaintiff or whoever is filing the lawsuit against Harvard at all?

If they're challenging the ruling and bringing it up to the Supreme Court, then are they challenging/disagreeing with the lower court's judge's finding that there was no evidence of discrimination?  

Because the lawyer mentioned repeatedly that it's a zero-sum game.  If you make a decision that weighs race as one possible factor, and Harvard admitted to a justice that in certain cases, race is the deciding factor between two candidates, then the other candidate who is not selected for admission is denied that education opportunity because that other candidate's race was not brought up and used as a factor tipping the scale in the candidate's favor.

If hypothetically in all the numerous instances that this scenario could happen - let's say 1 in 10,000 cases each year, over the course of the last 20 years, couldn't there have been at least a slim chance that one of those candidates whose race was not used to tip the scale to their benefit and result in admissions was Asian? And instead the other competing non-Asian candidate's race was factored as a plus in order to decide between the two, then does the candidate whose lost the admission spot have a sufficient argument for having standing?","17"

Conservatives have long asserted that in order to correct the USs history of treating race as the touchstone of an individuals identity (which includes the great sins of racial chattel slavery and racial discrimination), the 14th Amendment bars the government from treating people differently on the basis of race.

They may cloak their arguments in 14th Amendment justifications, but the actual result is the long desired conservative objective to weaken the Voting Rights Act and abolish affirmative action.

Non citizen based on what?  Based on their race. Certainly not their property rights, or their history. They were here centuries before us. Its the same distinction being made in 5A and Dred Scott:  

&gt; Persons of African descent cannot be and were never intended to be citizens under the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff is without standing to file a suit. 

*Because black.*

&gt; No person&deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process. 

White and male literally goes without saying. Why? Context. Because slaves were not free, and women couldnt vote. The property being discussed included black people. The fact that due process was only intended to apply to the white slave owner is reflected in the revealing frankness of that now deprecated decision. Paraphrased: You were never intended to be a citizenyou lack standing. Same as the Indian. Its ahistorical and revisionism to argue that the Constitution wasnt written for and by white patriarchy. Race is reflected in our system of Justice to this day. The term institutional racism isnt exclusive of the Constitution, it is grounded in it.","3_5_4_1_1"

Based on the fact that they saw themselves (and *still* see themselves, even after the countless crimes committed against them in the name of destroying this self-image) as sovereign nations with their own laws and rules of citizenship. One would not expect a French citizen to be counted by the German constitution, nor should they.

&gt;White and male literally goes without saying

No, it doesn't. Even at the time, the definition of 'white' wasn't settled, with questions and controversy surrounding the status of Irish, Italian, and other immigrants from traditionally Catholic nations; To say nothing of the Founding Fathers like John Adams who were not only non-slave owners but were proud of that fact. The *only* reason abolition was not pursued at Founding was the well-founded fear of what the Southern states might do to keep their slaves; Even at the time, the founders were well-aware of their hypocrisy, and the inclusion of the amendment process is a reflection of that. Dredd Scott is a misrule *because* of the willful ignorance of this fact: that the Founders were aware of their own failures and hypocrisies. By design, they created a system would be able to grow to embrace and protect both those that they could not bring themselves to, as well as those whose existence they had not even considered.","3_5_4_1_1_1"

 The reverse rarely exists anywhere other than your imagination, as rich kids don't typically live in poverty-level ZIP Codes, and even if they did live in some walled off compound, they aren't going to the local public school so they wouldn't get the advantage of that weighting, lol.   And hey, you know what, even if there are tens of kids who could exploit this situation, oh well.  Good for them, they beat the system.

There's a distinction between policies that have the effect of racial disparities and policies designed with the intent of creating racial disparities.

It's not ""passing the buck,"" it's simply stating a part of the mission of the university. Also, most people inherently don't get exposed to a particularly diverse cross-section of the population in primary school, given that the other students all come from the same very small geographic area and may not be particularly diverse on any axis as a result, and given that public schools don't select their students.

Well, notice how that differs from the intent in your previous comment.

Is the intent to create a student body that is vibrantly diverse, or to reflect the demographics of the country?

What might help to make the distinction more salient would be to ask how we think about admitting foreign students.

Every time a student from another country is admitted, the student body becomes more vibrantly diverse and simultaneously it looks less like the demographics of the country. [And just to clarify, I'm not talking about current green card holders; I'm talking about who, at the time of their admission, were residents of another country.]

Because part of the idea of college, especially at places like Harvard, is that you're not just teaching people how to do advanced math, you're creating people who will be empowered to take on leadership roles in the country for the rest of their lives, and college is one of the very few times that you can truly throw someone into a mixing pot of all different types of people to try and teach them about the various perspectives and communities that will be affected by their work the rest of their life. Of course I would also like to apply this to wealth and eliminate preference for kids of rich donors or legacy admissions, who are vastly overrepresented in elite universities.

It doesn't need to match perfectly to the 0.1%, but I don't think it's crazy to treat it as a consideration if your class demographics look absolutely nothing like the country, especially if it means avoiding an outcome where sizable segments of the American population (like the 30% of Americans who are black or latino) are borderline absent from the school's community.","2_1_2_4_1_2_1"

By the way the comment was worded, it was clear that it wasn't meant to be taken so seriously, but regardless, you've basically stated that you've made a strawman argument by deliberately misinterpreting their statement.  However, I think you could argue that idea is fundamental to the case.  The argument being that they've put some groups at advantage to admissions (hispanics and african americans), which is pushing others at a disadvantage (asians).  The case is about how the prosecution doesn't think admissions based on race are being enacted fairly.  You're right that context matters, but like I said before, if you want to make a substantive argument about the context, you will need to provide more specifics about the context and the specific goals of what constitutes 'advantage'. (e.g. admission rates, graduate rates, etc.)  The comment you are unhappy with very clearly and intentionally was not attempting to deal with those issues at all (as you have mentioned).","2_2_2_1_1_1_1_1"

I read the district court briefs by the parties, and according to the Plaintiff this is what Harvard's academic pool (test scores and grades) looks like (Proportions are not accurate, just a visual) :

**|**

**|               |**

**|               |                  |**

**|               |                  |             |**

(Asian) | White | (Latino) | (Af. Am.)

Here's what Harvard's ""Personal Rating"" based essentially on ""likability"" is:

**|**

**|               |**

**|               |                   |**

**|               |                   |           |** 

(Af Am.)| (Latino) | (White) | (Asian)

At the district court level, the Judge at the end of the Harvard opinion said because the difference among personal ratings between Asian Americans and WHITE people is not so big, there is no significant discrimination. That misses the point, because what the Plaintiffs were arguing is that Harvard is assigning these personal ratings inversely proportional to  general academic strength of the different race categories. This way it can boost African American, Latino, and White seats at the cost of Asian seats based on an un-checkable factor called ""personality.""

I think the fact that the order of academic achievement among the four ""races"" (and isn't having four ""races"" based on skin color arbitrary in and of itself?) is precisely the opposite of how ""likeable"" each ethnicity is clearly presents a problem. Its also double dipping because likeability is supposedly race neutral and takes place after they already grant the ""plus"" factor for a student's race. The argument is that they are doubling up on race considerations. If you rely too much on race your admissions becomes unconstitutional. How much is too much? That's what all these decisions struggle with and in my opinion fighting over the nuance of race and how to weigh race is exactly why this is so much of a problem and creates so much animosity. Allowing race to be used only as a ""plus factor"" was always a tall task.

The Plaintiff argued using personality to secretly double-dip is unconstitutional even without changing any precedent. I *think* people in 2022 are less willing to see people get preferential treatment from admissions office because of their skin color.  My prediction is SCOTUS overturns the old case law and says these colleges need to focus on socio-economic factors. Giving middle-class and wealthy African American students an edge over lower-middle class Asian and white students just feels wrong.

It's incredibly stressful and resource intensive on all fronts.  

I just don't know if a lottery is a good system, either.  Both because I personally tend to be unlucky in lotteries (there was once a school lottery where 99.9% of people receive one of their choices. Out of thousands of people, guess who _didn't_ get any of their choices and had a really sucky situation?  Yep, me.) -- and, especially so, because it's hard to compare different schools, environments, etc.

We truly want to give chances to those kids who are succeeding despite not having support, and not only to those who are riding high because of all the parental support, money, opportunities, etc. And here I am speaking as a parent who's providing that kind of support to my kids.  They are great kids and I want them to do well, but we as the society really need to help those who don't have this kind of parental support also.

My personal preference would be for many universities to band together and have a single-admit system, like medical schools do.  Have one application -- as extensive as colleges want, but one. Then have kids rank colleges and colleges rank kids, and come out with a match.

Not really. Exceptional poor whites (i.e., whites from poor backgrounds who are too stupid to self identify as POC but otherwise have good stats) are discriminated against in elite university admissions. This is pretty much beyond argument at this point. Your earlier point about legacy admissions is a part of this. 

Also, black test scores defy classification along class. The bottom economic quartile of white test takers outperforms the top economic quartile of black test takers, across standardized tests (meaning undergrad, professional, and graduate standardized tests).

After the lawyer submitted the brief containing the fake cases, the opposing lawyers and the judge reached out for help in locating the actual opinions that were being cited:

&gt;They pointed to a lengthy quote from the purported Varghese decision contained in the brief. The undersigned has not been able to locate this quotation, nor anything like it in any case, Aviancas lawyers wrote.

&gt;Indeed, the lawyers added, the quotation, which came from Varghese itself, cited something called Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co. Ltd., an opinion purportedly handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 2008. They said they could not find that, either.

&gt;Judge Castel ordered Mr. Matas attorneys to provide copies of the opinions referred to in their brief. The lawyers submitted a compendium of eight; in most cases, they listed the court and judges who issued them, the docket numbers and dates.

&gt;The copy of the supposed Varghese decision, for example, is six pages long and says it was written by a member of a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit. But Aviancas lawyers told the judge that they could not find that opinion, or the others, on court dockets or legal databases.

This should have been a red flag to the lawyer that something was up. If the cases cited by ChatGPT were real, why wouldn't they come up anywhere else? When he was asked to send in the actual written opinions, didn't he think it was strange that the only way he could find them was in ChatGPT and nowhere else?","1_1"

And it is pretty damning imo.

First, plaintiff's brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss contains direct quotations from the fake decisions. Counsel either (i) never read any of the decisions and simply allowed chatGPT to write the brief; or (ii) he obtained copies of the chatGPT generated fake opinions before filing his brief.

Filing a brief written by chatGPT without reading any of the case law yourself would be sanctionable all by itself imo. But in this instance, if he did get the fake opinions before filing his brief, that's actually worse. Because in yesterday's filings he attached a copy of a portion of his query with chatGPT in which he expresses doubts about the citations and cases - literally asking chatGPT if the opinions were ""fake"".

Secondly, as you point out, when defense counsel's reply filing stated that the citations were bogus, how in the world does any practicing trial attorney attach paper copies of cases and literally state in his forwarding affidavit that some of the decisions were not ""complete"". Opposing counsel had already made clear the citations did not exist on Westlaw or Lexis. Yet plaintiff's affidavit providing the cases to the court only mentions some ""online database"" as his source, without any mention of chatGPT nor any attempt to explain why he was attaching cases that were missing portions of the decision.

Thirdly, the Court's second Order to Show Cause states that plaintiff's counsel must bring the original of his April 25th affidavit with the ""wet ink"" signature and notarization because the Court notes that while the Affidavit is dated April 25th, the notarization was Jan 25, 2023.

Having been a trial attorney myself for over 40 years, I have to believe this Judge is rip roaring pissed off at what has taken place - and imo by the fact an attorney submitted a brief written by AI without himself reading any of the case law - OR worse the attorney did read the cases and was already suspicious they were fake before submitting his brief - and without first getting official copies from Westlaw.

Good thing for both of the two plaintiff's counsel that I am not the judge holding the order to show cause hearing. I just wish it was going to be televised.

There is, generally, a lot less at stake in what must of us do. No one is going to die based on this guy using chat GPT. His client may not even lose this motion to dismiss, but that apparently depends on whether or not an airline bankruptcy actually tolls the statute of limitations. Second, it isn't as if this lawyer can't expect consequences. He will be sanctioned by the court here and be ordered to pay a likely substantial amount of money. He will also be disciplined. I just don't expect discipline to include disbarred, absent a past history of discipline. It could include a public reprimand or a suspension though. He may also be liable to a malpractice suit, if his client's claim could have been successful, just like a doctor would. I'm not sure an engineer can be sued for malpractice since I've never practiced in that area, but I assume they can. 

Part of the reason disbarrment is unlikely is because of how high a penalty it is. It is essentially the legal death penalty, saved for only the most severe or repeated unethical conduct. I've seen *plenty* of incompetent lawyers do some very incompetent shit which hasn't led to them losing their license. This case is mostly interesting because of the intersection of incompetence with an emerging technology. However, it isn't practically different than if this lawyer relied on a clerk or paralegal to write his brief and didn't double-check that research and the clerk doubledowned by creating fake cases. 

As I thought about it more, I think the biggest problem he might be facing is if he billed the client for the brief when he clearly didn't actually write it. Though this is a PI case, so he may have taken it on contingency and didn't actually charge the client anything.","1_1_1_2_1_3_1"

ChatGPT is _very_ confident in the answers that it provides.

The thing to note about that is that ChatGPT is also _very_ confidently wrong - hence why it asserted in this guy's case that what he cited was definitely a ""real case"", and why [that one Texas professor took ""ChatGTP"" at it's word](https://www.businessinsider.com/professor-fails-students-after-chatgpt-falsely-said-it-wrote-papers-2023-5) when he stated that ChatGPT was indicating that it had written a student's paper.

ChatGPT will also completely fabricate citations without the realization of the person using it (or perhaps with their realization depending on the person, and depending on if they expect someone will fact-check it - which, in certain settings, they may not, but they will likely do so in a legal setting).

With that said, if you provided the entirety of said cases as an input to ChatGPT, then it might do a better job of citing them, but doing so within the context of using it to write an entire brief - in my opinion - is a foolish course of action.","4_1_3"

That key point is quite believable. Given all the press ChatGPT has  received about what it has been able to properly do, consider someone who has happened to miss its royal screw ups and  isn't very tech much not tech-savvy. From the latest affidavits, the lawyer has been practicing for 30+ years, making him 50 absolute minimum.  It is that hard to imagine such an individual not understanding the difference between doing a search on Westlaw for a case and asking this different online database-type system to do a search? Of course, not reading it after the system gave him the citation is another story.

ChatGPT apparently (at some point) spit out a fully generated case to match the citation (for a number of cases) which were coherent enough that OC and the judge didn't see them as obviously AI-generated. So the lawyer sees the citiation, has some doubt, asks follow up questions to verify it, and ChatGPT gives him a full real-looking case file. 

To be clear, I'm not defending this guy. He screwed up royally multiple times despite some pretty huge red flags, in particular in letting something else come up with his citations and not verifying them, just to start. I'm just making the point, not realizing that ChatGPT can't reliably search for a case's existence or that is might not just produce a citation to a case, but spit out a generated case itself, is actually somewhat understandable.

I completely understand the guy going back to chatGPT to ""check"". I'm actually surprised that people don't understand his mistake (I'm talking about understanding his thinking, not excusing his actions). 

So westlaw is a database/search engine for legal cases, right? If I teach you this, and you find a case, and I say ""hey are you sure it's the right number?"", you'll just go back to Westlaw and double check. You won't think ""oh maybe this index is wrong"". When I can't find the complete text of a pubmed article I don't suddenly distrust pubmed. 


If a student told me ""patient BP is 184/98"" and I asked them to double check, they'd just press the button again on the BP monitor - they probably would not get an analogic device because now suspect the electronic monitor. I usually have to teach that.


The guy *believed* he was using a tool that could find and write about cases. When prompted ""are you sure"", he double checked and hey, yeah, the cases are right here in the tool. 

Once we understand that he has no idea what ChatGPT is, it's easy to understand the whole thing.

Birth fathers change their minds *a lot*. For a good chunk of them, it's a giant kick in the ass that they are a father to a child when they realize the birth mother is giving up a child for adoption.   

If he had not pursued custody, if he had not started to pay child support, and he had not filed challenges to the adoption, they would have the child. ICWA would have only possibly delayed the adoption, as they would look for other family members, other Cherokee, or other Indian families willing to adopt the child.  

Simple fact of law is that birth parents have the right to step in and say they will not allow an adoption. If they don't make any efforts to step in and parent, then the court can tell them to (politely) fuck off.   

In this case, he pushed for custody, and AFAIK, he's now had the child for 2 years. That's hardly the deadbeat dad most of the critics are trying to cast him as. He did a 180, but he did it when he was informed of what was going on.  ","5_1"

S.C. Section 63-9-350 concerns revocations of consents. While it is certainly not a simple procedure, a birth parent revoking consent can request a hearing to present why they are revoking, and it must be done before the final hearing where the decree of adoption is granted.   

In this case, that is what Brown did. He got a stay granted for the duration of his deployment, and the decree was never awarded because they screwed up ICWA notifications. Cherokee almost always (in my experience) intervenes and seeks placement according to ICWA preferences.  

In short, the adoptive couple would have never had pre-adoptive custody had their attorney properly notified the tribe. ","5_1_1_1"

Right, but again, the question there is whether the case can be removed from local courts to tribal courts, not whether the adoption will go through at all. Whether that's a foregone conclusion once it reaches tribal courts, I can't comment on, but it was my understanding that this was a case about which court has jurisdiction to decide on the adoption, *not* a case that would actually decide the adoption's outcome. Is that correct?

ETA: A bit of further research shows this is incorrect. This is, in fact, about whether the Indian father can block the adoption altogether, by demonstrating that the procedural protections found in 25 U.S.C. s. 1912(d) and (f) have not been fulfilled. 1912(d) requires that a party seeking to terminate a parental relationship to an Indian child to show active efforts to prevent the breakup of the Indian family. (f) requires a determination that continued custody by the Indian parent would be likely to result in severe emotional or physical harm to the child.","5_2_1_1"

The case cannot be removed to tribal courts from state courts over a biological parent's veto. Removal is foreclosed. Removal is also foreclosed if the adoptive parents object show good cause why the case should remain in state court.

There are, to my knowledge, no removal procedural issues expressed in this case, beyond some amicus briefs from various tribes.

The best interests of the child are the primary factor for the court to consider in all custody matters. Here, we have a ""father"" who was disinterested in raising the child, so he relinquished his rights. As soon as the child is put up for adoption, no reaction. Once the adoption proceedings being, he tries to undo his rel. of rights. *Insert Indian Giver Joke Here...*. 

I thought this one would have been a quick 9-0 decision, just based on the basic facts. The parental right was extinguished, independent of ICWA. ICWA exists to protect existing parental rights from outside assault, not provide a back avenue for reasserting them. Simply put, this is not what ICWA was designed to prevent. ICWA should be viewed narrowly. ICWA was created to prevent the forced breakup of the Indian family and the destruction of tribal culture. This case is about the best interests of a child, whose mother had sole parental rights and put her up for adoption. Do the best interests of the child really lie with the ""parent"" who clearly relinquished his parental rights? In state court we would probably say No. Just because the child's biological father, who relinquished his parental rights, is Indian, should not change the Court's advocacy for the child's interest. 

Personal opinion, but I suspect that the fathers motives are not for the best interest of the child, rather it is an attempt to secure an additional share of that sweet, sweet Cherokee Indian Casino distribution. Which can count out to about 10k a head, though is usually around 5k per. I have no actual evidence to support that, just rank suspicion from the circumstances and my poor opinion of the human race in general. Even so, I hope Baby Girl gets to a home where she is loved and cared for by whomever raises her. Also, I hope she takes advantage of those lucrative tribal college scholarships when she, no doubt, attends law school in 2035 (projected cost 1.8 million dollars and up).","5_3"

ICWA exists to protect existing parental rights from outside assault, not provide a back avenue for reasserting them. Simply put, this is not what ICWA was designed to prevent.  

This is incorrect. I work in an adoption firm. The attorney for the adoptive parents fucked this up several times.  

His parental rights were granted extra protection because of the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act of 2004. Under that law, any enlisted that are on active duty has additional venues and time for civil suits in which they are a party. He was served with papers regarding consent to adoption days before he was deployed for 2 years. He signed the documents and didn't realize he signed *adoption* papers until afterwards. Dumbfuck thing to do, but he did it.   

That is never the end of the story. There is always time for someone to revoke consent in any state, which is usually before it is filed. He immediately contacted his own father, gave him power of attorney to combat it while he was deployed.  

SMCRA is what gave him extra time, not ICWA.  

ICWA comes in because the lawyer is a moron. ICWA requires a separate hearing to terminate rights, which also include notice to any and all possible tribes who would have something to say. Failing to identify the father properly to the tribe is the lawyer's fault; he should have asked her for any and all possible spellings of his name, and had those not only sent to the tribe, but confirmed on the consent. Mistakes of identity can fuck up termination proceedings, ICWA or not. The hearing never happened, so the birth father and his family never got the chance to properly challenge it.   

None of the people reporting on this case will ever mention SMCRA because they don't want to seem anti-enlisted. Parental rights were never cleanly or properly terminated, even without ICWA.  

As for baby girl winding up with a good family, her birth father's now had custody for 2 years. She'll recall him as her parent far more than the adoptive family who had her as an infant. Best interest as far as permanency would be concerned would to leave her with her father, regardless of the legal implications of the court decision. ","5_3_1"

&gt;SMCRA is what gave him extra time, not ICWA. 

ICWA does not preserve an otherwise validly extinguished parental right. SMCRA does. This case is not about the father's rights under SMCRA, the Court is hearing this within an ICWA framework. So, my statements are accurate within the issues set forth by the parties, but not necessarily accurate on issues beyond the scope of the SC writings. ","5_3_1_1"

The issue revolving around ICWA is also an issue of SC's definition of a parent. SC is harsh on birth father definitions and requirements for consent.  

In short, if a birth father is not what we consider a ""custodial parent"" (media's words, NOT SC law) that is physically present OR emotionally bonded OR financially supportive, consent is NOT required. This begs the question: why didn't they default him when they all swear up and down this was the case?  

There's 2 possibilities. Most likely is that SMCRA is a pain in the ass to get a GAL for, and consents are cheaper. Also possible is Brown's allegation that he was never informed of the birth or the adoption until he was served with consent papers.  Regardless of which, they served him with documents they NOW argue were not needed.   

What does this have to do with ICWA? ICWA is a federal law with its own rules regarding who needs notice and with whom the children can be placed. It's basically state definitions vs. federal dictates.

[Here is a better run-down](http://www.nicwa.org/babyveronica/#Summary). I understand why you would have believed in the misinformation due to the onslaught of the media campaign the foster parents ran. 

Dusten Brown was engaged to Christina Maldonado. She became pregnant while he was stationed in Oklahoma. In the latter parts of the pregnancy, she broke off all ties with him. Unbeknownst to him, before the birth, she had already made plans to adopt the child out. When she gave birth she purposefully did not identify the child as Cherokee despite the fact the father is an enrolled member of the Cherokee Tribe. The mother's attorney purposefully served him the legal papers before he was deployed to Iraq. He got a stay because of his military status on the proceeding and immediately moved to get custody. 

The South Carolina Family Court, upon his return from Iraq, transferred custody of Veronica to her father and ruled that ICWA was not unconstitutional, Brown had established paternity, and the exception to the ICWA the the Existing Indian Family Exception did not apply. The foster parents appealed this and lost in the state supreme court. This would be the basis for the appeal to the supreme court. 

The holding in the supreme court was that the existing indian family exception did apply. The existing indian family exception is a judicially made common-law exception to ICWA - wherein states (historically hostile to indian interest) do not apply ICWA unless the state court finds there is an ""existing Indian family"". The reason this doctrine is uniquely harmful is because it circumvents the entire point of ICWA because it allows State Courts to use its own cultural imperative on what constitutes a family. The entire point of ICWA was to prevent the cultural genocide that had been occurring to Natives. After the Indian Boarding schools closed in the late 1960s, an explosion of states forcibly taking children from their parents because the social worker would call them unfit (based on racial stereotypes and misunderstandings) to the point where 40% of Native Children were being adopted out of Indian country - and that's why we have ICWA to prevent that. [More on the history of the existing indian family doctrine](http://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-existing-indian-family-exception-to-53130/) and [the American Bar Association's amicus brief details how adoptions replaced Indian boarding schools](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs-v2/12-399_resp_amcu_profs-indianlaw.authcheckdam.pdf). 

So, the holding in the Supreme Court is unclear on its effect on the other parts of the state supreme court's holdings about Brown's fitness as a parent or how he never relinquished parental rights. 

Your characterization that ""It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life"" is just wrong. He sent gifts and money while she was pregnant that got returned, including the 20 pairs of socks his mother knitted for the child. Stop watching Dr. Phil. Maybe you should look at the state holdings and facts instead of looking to the media.

1. Strict racial quotas are unconstitutional under current jurisprudence. 
2. You didnt indicate whether racial quotas included legacy admissions or what percentage of admissions of different races were included in the racial quotas you claim exist (they dont exist - see point 1 above), so it really wasnt clear what you were arguing other than that prospective white students who werent legacy admissions had a more difficult time than prospective white students who were. That point is obvious already because inherent in legacy admissions is the idea that qualifications are relaxed due to family members previously attending the school.
3. Im not sure why youre attacking my logical reasoning ability when you dont know that use of racial quotas in admissions is unconstitutional and therefore not used. Harvard isnt even allowed to consider race anymore, but even when they were, they didnt have quotas like you claimed they did without providing supporting evidence.","3_1_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

The benefits cannot be understated, the efficacy of a diverse highly functioning group doesn't grow linearly, or even geometrically, but factorially. 

This obvious benefit plus a student who has to do maybe 5-10× more  outside of scholastic work, versus a more well-supported and funded residual wealth competitor, and still does stellar should have that competetive dis-advantage neutralized (strategically). Not to mention we know for a fact that disadvantages travel down through generations. 

Finally, like a third or more of students at many elite schools are legacy students. The idea that that a small number of disadvanted people committed to their education can't also benefit, along with their schools and other students, from programs set up for them is beyond any rational argument.

The domains that cover these disciplinary concentrations are; decision science, just look up the reading list on good reads, it's comprehensive. Behavioral economics, specifically ""Nudge"" by Richard Thaler, Behavioral Economics course by Scott Huettel (The Great Courses), and any ""Operations Research"". Also from a more neurological and physiological perspective ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kaneman is good. 

Personally, I think the Bahavioral Economics course by Scott Huettel is one of the best courses on the subject. It's affordable and insightful and almost effortlessly methodically presented, as a good introduction or intermediate presentation of the material. The ""How You Decide"" course by professor Ryan Hamilton was good too if I remember correctly, and ""Mathematical Decision Making"" by Dr Scott P. Stevens.

This is the group decision making lecture from Scott Huettel [Lecture 18](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6f9zXq_hjFkT0NTZkJaX0pBdmc/view?usp=drivesdk). I think the diversity over ability might be located here.

More likely you monitor the student body and enact strategic processes that culminate with the most efficacious student body social environment as possible. There is no hard optimal percentage, and thinking so would be a fallacy. 

The staff at this institution are no joke, they are highly organized highly intelligent people who have dedicated their lives to education, society, and this institution. MBA professors, Harvard Law Professors, Policy Experts, this intellectual community is one of incredible intelligence. I've been privy to this interaction, they are constantly self-optimizing with voluminous communication, and although I know some institutions can become bureaucratic monoliths Harvard does not appear to be that way. 

I'm all for government intervention in non-functioning, non-self optimizing free-market organizations, but more so from an incentive perspective of soft-power rather than regulation. As in grants and such. But Harvard does not seem to be non-functioning, quite the opposite actually. 

As an example 6% of Asians are in the general population but represent 23% of a recent freshman class? From an Operations Research perspective this does not seem like optimization of the social environment, which is one of the most critical elements at University. 

Further, from what I read it isn't acceptance policies against specific cultures and races, it's policies that indirectly effect these demographs. Any suggestion that Harvard is racist probably doesn't deserve a response. 

But all this being said this issue does have complexity, and maybe an inquiry might have utility by bringing to light some of the methadologies being implemented. But this is a private organization that I believe is trying to do what is best for its faculty, student body, and community. But I'm also open to other perspectives as long as they aren't so reductionistic as to be counter-productive.

Hiring nonwhite judges is an important step, but it doesnt necessarily preclude racial bias. For example, there is some evidence that Black police officers have the most economic incentive to treat Black suspects harshly, for fear that they will otherwise be considered playing favorites. We shouldnt be dismissing these concerns because of a comical level of diversity in hiring judges. Instead, we should affirm our responsibility and quadruple our efforts to root out bias.

Likewise, the framing of the nonwhite lawyers cant find jobs issue as somehow relevant to the issue of diversity in law schools is not neutral. If clients cant trust the system, so they dont want a nonwhite lawyer, so nonwhite lawyers cant bill hours, we cant conclude that they arent bringing value to the table. Theres a very simple solution: pay them anyway. Firms AND law schools need to take their share of responsibility for the stark racial disparity in our legal system. 

In all, I find your argument very convenient. If we can just wait around for the culture to fix the problem, then we can just sit on our thumbs. But really, its our hiring, our wages, our representation that is building that culture.","1_2"

The social science shows the racial surroundings affecting human attitudes. Thats a rate problem. We dont know how much bias is in the system, but if we add more nonwhite people, the incidence goes down. If there was a lot of bias at the beginning, there will still be a lot of bias at the end, just less.

You used that data to attempt to determine incidence. Do we see lots of nonwhite judges? Yes, therefore racism is over. Any client who thinks there may be some bias against a nonwhite lawyer is just being superstitious, a silly phenomenon that they picked up somewhere out there in the culture. Surely not something based in fact, because, congratulations guys, somebody let Al Sharpton know, you just proved that racism is over now.

No, obviously not. You pulled a MMC. I described the *pipeline* to becoming a judge. You flattened it to the very end of that pipeline. 

Hyper-focusing on the end of that pipeline is useful if you want to dismiss your clients concerns about bias. Look at only this, and stop talking about bias. But if we zoom out at, for example, the article above about law schools, we notice that all these judges are swimming for so much of their career in a radically underrepresented pipeline. 

Hyper-focusing on the end is great if you want to tie your own hands: Theres nothing at all I can do, its all a demand problem, its totally somebody elses responsibility, and also its actually been solved the whole time. Zooming out shows us how much power we have.

Which is doubly annoying to me because the court points out elsewhere in the decision that the patent is clearly not purely compositional (because any deviation from the composition would not infringe the patent, such as any mutation, anywhere, and Myriad clearly would not want a patent so narrow). As a result, the actual information (what the DNA codes for) is part of the patent in a way.

By the way, have you ever read Clarence Thomas's opinions on affirmative action?

This is because you are probably considering each racial minority group as a homogeneous entity.  The argument above would isolate the group of those minorities who, on their own merit, would have been admitted to school X.  Then it asks whether it is a violation of that distinct subset's equal protection under the law to undermine their achievement with affirmative action.

I would analogize it to US v. Virginia where it did not matter if most women would not prefer the VMI style education, there was an equal protection violation as long as some women would prefer it and were excluded.  Thus, the harm of a policy based on a suspect class does not necessarily have to harm every member if it harms some.  Of course, this argument hasn't succeeded so far with the supreme court, but I believe that this is along the lines of Thomas's position, though I have not reread it recently.","1_2_1_1_1_1_1_3_1"

College is a business, and the four years a student spends there is the product they sell.  Racial and ethnic diversity is considered a selling point.  Students don't want to go somewhere that is almost exclusively white.  Students care about racial and ethnic diversity because they can see it, and it's politically popular.  Students don't a lot about socioeconomic diversity.  

It's similar to athletic recruiting.  Admissions preference is given to athletes because having a good sports program enhances the product the school is selling, which increases demand for it.  

It's also similar to geographic recruiting.  Every school touts how many states and countries are represented in their student body.  (That this can serve as a proxy for racial criteria seems to bother no one.)  Having European or African or Australian kids in classrooms also enhances the product the school is selling, which increases demand for it. 

In each instance, increasing demand allows the school to attract more applicants, which allows them to be more selective, which causes them to rise in league tables, which in turn enhances the product the school is selling, which increases demand for it.  Rising in US News rankings has become the raison d'etre for college presidents.

Now I'm not saying this is the way the world should be, and I think it's abominable that higher education has become a business.  But if we are going to argue against the use of racial criteria in admissions, let's at least recognize what we are truly dealing with.  

No one cares about poor people.  No one cares about giving minorities an edge.  This is just a business decision.  Maybe the Court will hold that this business decision violates the Equal Protection Clause, but let's not get ahead of ourselves by considering replacing racial AA with something that appears to serve a meritocratic purpose but serves no business purpose.  No one is interested in that, which is why the studies you cite showing the benefits of socioeconomic affirmative action are routinely ignored.  ","1_3"

There isn't much of a downside if you're just considering it from the standpoint of the good of society. We could desperately use some greater economic equality and reduction of the gap between minority populations and whites.

But from a legal downside it's decidedly icky. You're using a racially neutral scheme for the purpose of advantaging a racial category (and necessarily disadvantages the other races). It's hard to differentiate that from any other racially neutral schemes that governments in America have used to *dis*advantage blacks - except that this time it's for a good cause, right?

Will Smith and Bill Cosby can probably afford to pay to send their kids to good private schools or to live in areas with really good public schools. Their kids will probably get a damn good education, or at least have good tutors.

Their kids probably were/will never be touched by AA, because their grades are probably good enough to get them one of the non-AA college admissions slots that has higher academic standards than AA.

EDIT: THIS IS POSSIBLY MISGUIDED AND FALSE ~~AA is not something that automatically kicks in if the applicant is black; the school sets aside a certain number of admissions slots that are dedicated to AA students, and those slots are open to minority applicants who don't already qualify for the normal admissions standards.~~

I can understand how, due to the stigma of ""ghetto"" culture, a totally qualified African-American wouldn't get a fair shake in life, and AA is a reasonable way of tipping the balance the other way.

What I cannot understand, however, is why Latinos also get the benefit of AA while Asians get a massive disadvantage from AA despite the latter having seen a much longer history of discrimination than the former.  

What I cannot understand is why Asians have a disadvantage against *whites*.  It really looks like to me that prestigious institutions are very uncomfortable with having the same demographic makeup of, say, an average University of California school.

If a minority student comes from a family with high SES, then they will have had the better educational opportunities and access to better schools that typically comes with SES, and will most likely have higher grades and better applications.

They probably won't be considered for AA in the first place, because their application was good enough to get them in on their own merits.

If a minority student comes from a family with low SES, they probably lived in a poor area with lower-tier schools, and will have a correspondingly lower academic record when applying for college. The ceiling for how good their application can be is effectively lower. Those students are more likely to be rejected from the non-AA slots, but possibly accepted into the AA slots.

No, we're disagreeing, because each of us is interpreting the goal of AA in a different way.

The way that I see AA, white students being disadvantage because of AA isn't all that relevant, because AA isn't just about SES. SES does have an effect on education performance, but it's a secondary effect, not a causative one, and AA isn't meant to counter effects due to low SES.

Yes, white students don't get any help at all from AA, even if they're just as disadvantaged by low SES. But that's not the point of AA. The point of AA is that those students, as a group, don't need that bump.

AA is about group-level effects, not about individual justice, and the group-level effect that AA is trying to counter is institutionalized racism against certain minority groups.","1_7_2_1_1_1_2_1"

As I stated above, I'm operating under the impression (based on a combined 40+ years in education by my parents professionally) that the most important factor in predicting student success is how much your parents make.  Not your skin color.  I don't think a black kid with wealthy parents who went to a good school should get a bump over a poor kid who went to a crappy school, regardless of the latter's race.  

If we want to talk group-level effects, look at the number of people who fall below the poverty line.  Wikipedia says it is 46 million as of 2010, and that is defined as a family of four making less than $23,050.  I'd bet that there are a great many other people who don't officially qualify as ""poor"" who still deal with a crappy school, less opportunities, and so on.  That official number is obviously less than the 100 million or so people who would be classified as ""minority"" during admissions.  But I think it is wrong to say, ""ALL minorities NEED (or deserve) a bump up.""  

I also don't think there is really much in the way of institutionalized racism any more.  Not saying it is gone entirely, but there is a post farther down that makes a pretty good case that diversity is good for business.  And colleges are a business now.  ","1_7_2_1_1_1_2_1_1"

Absolutely not.  In my experience, university faculty and staff are heavily invested in a worldview which makes affirmative action an absolute moral imperative.  If the supreme court tried to push true racial blindness onto them they would likely find that the opposition was deep and strong.  I would expect protests, outright defiance and many attempts to bypass the rules.

This is why it would be very hard to force racial blindness.  What if they ask for a picture of the candidate?  What if they require a video interview?  Ask them to write a story about their family's history as part of the admissions packet?  Ask them to list all of their high school student organizations, with the understanding that minority organizations get preference?

This, of course, means that the remaining 20% or so is very competitive. UT admits roughly half of its applicants, accepting about [7,500 students](http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/94/opinions_college08_Americas-Best-Colleges_ClassSize.html) and rejecting another [8,000](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-texas-3658).

From the [Fisher's brief](http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/briefs/11-345_pet.authcheckdam.pdf), pages 9 and 10:

&gt; Notwithstanding UTs failure to measure the impact of using race on its enrollment numbers, App. 104a, **it is clear that impact is negligible**, SJA 157a. By design, race can be determinative only for in-state underrepresented minority students not admitted under the Top 10% Law, a segment of the class that is dwarfed by the Top 10% enrollees. For example, in 2008, when Petitioner applied, 6,322 in-state students enrolled: 5,114 under the Top 10% Law and 1,208 under the race-affected AI/PAI regime. Id. Of the non-Top 10% enrollees, 216 were African American or Hispanic, representing only 3.4% of the enrolled in- state freshman class. Id. 

&gt; Moreover, it is undisputed that many of the 216 non- Top 10% minority enrollees would have been admitted without regard to their race. Some were admitted based solely on high AI scores. App. 103a; JA 410a. Many more would have been admitted under an AI-PAI system unaffected by race. App. 104a. To illustrate, when race was not a factor in the PAI calculus, 15.2% of the non-Top 10% Texas enrollees in 2004 were African American or Hispanic; in 2008, when race was considered, 17.9% were African American or Hispanic. SJA 157a. Thus, **even if the entirety of the increase between 2004 and 2008 is attributed to race, it would have been decisive for only 2.7% of the 1,208 non-Top Ten enrollees in 2008or 33 African-American and Hispanic students combined.** Id. If so, race would have accounted for 0.5% of the 6,322 in- state freshman class in 2008. In other words, UTs use of race has had an infinitesimal impact on critical mass in the student body as a whole. App. 107a (Garza, J.)

Emphasis mine.

I understand that the point Fisher's lawyers are trying to make is that this race preference system has such a negligible effect that it doesn't actually further the government interest in a diverse student body. But all I'm seeing is that Fisher herself was not harmed by this, because I highly doubt that she was one of the 33 white/Asian candidates who would have gotten in but for race preferences.","14"

I can see how it could have gone either way: On the one hand it does seem unfair to allow for a punishment to get worse during the time between committing a crime and getting sentenced.  And this time can drag out quite awhile as we are all aware.  One does not have the notice of the punishment prior to the crime- which goes to the root of why this clause exists in the first place.

On the other hand, this creates some complications in sentencing.  The guidelines were created to simplify the sentencing process and give a non-biased uniformity.  Further, the notice pertains to the degree of punishment not whether your actions constitute a crime.

Maybe someone can help me understand exactly how this ended up split liberal/conservative.  My 'snarky' instinct is to believe that one side spoke up first and the other group went the other way because of competitiveness/argumentativeness/just because.","2"

The dissent said . . . they're just guidelines.  They're not binding.  Now, since they're guidelines, judges can deviate.  And therefore no Ex Post Facto **Law** actually forces a newer, greater punishment greater than before.  The constitution doesn't say congress can make no ex post facto guideline.  Because that is just a *risk* of a higher punishment.

Of course, that ignores: 1) the guidelines are pretty much uniformly followed as the *starting point* except that judges can deviate *from* the guidelines for specified reasons.  So, there is an anchoring problem.  2) Is the argument that that it isn't ""binding"" more than a nod and a wink to the ex post facto clause?

Also, Justice Thomas said that guidelines were more *accurate* though god only knows what the hell that means.  I mean, that comes down to: who gets to decide what is the most accurate punishment for a particular crime, congress or the judiciary or the sentencing commission?  And that assumes there is such a thing as an accurate punishment.  I mean, considering how non-violent drug laws or the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act are punished with absurdly disproportionate penalties.  As for drug laws, crack cocaine got substantially heavier penalties under harsh drug laws than powder cocaine which shows you that accuracy is bullshit (to be fair, I believe the black caucus lobbied for strong punishment for crack because it was decimating black communities).

Similarly, the liberal justices said: yeah it isn't binding, and our rules have sort of said it has to be binding or a significant risk of increased punishment, but if you look at what actually happens: it is functionally binding and it would be sheer lip service to say there is no ex post facto violation.  

-----

To illustrate, consider the effect of doubling guidelines from 30 months to 60 months.  Imagine a person sentenced to 45 months.  Under old guidelines, the lower guidelines, it would mean the judge would have to justify an ""upward"" deviation of 15 months from the guideline 30 months.  That is a very very significant 50% upward deviation that would require aggravating factors - it is way away from the time in jail suggested by the guidelines.  Under the newer, higher guidelines, the 45 months represents a 15 month downward deviation that would have to be justified by mitigating factors and is only a 25% downward deviation. 

Is the newer guideline more accurate than the old one?  Is it mere ipse dixit?  Or is it unabiding faith that the legislative process has determined the correct process to gauge proper sentences?

According to the liberal majority, essentially by setting the bar and asking judges to find a reason to deviate creates a situation in which the ex post facto clause is violated.  These are two entirely different situations from which the judge will assess the *reasonableness* of a particular penalty.  The guidelines are generally treated as *presumptively* reasonable.  So, isn't that significant as far as limiting discretion?  At least as a matter of prudential reasoning if not constitutional.  So the conservatives essentially say: prudentially, maybe it does but constitutionally it doesn't because it doesn't meet the *text*.  Similarly, liberals essentially said (in the opinion carrying the day): prudentially, yeah, and the protection from punishment increases under the ex post facto clause cannot be so cleverly skirted by such a literal reading of a ""guideline"" as not a binding law.

It sounds like he was seriously suggesting that legal changes over time were truth-tracking, in the vague sense that a naive scientific realism suggests that our scientific theories better approximate truth over time. The problem is that even this, in the context of scientific theories, is roundly rejected when you try to extend that to suggest that every new theory is better than the last. Even the weakest form (expressed as a general propensity to be truth-tracking) isn't uncontroversial either. So if we have controversy over how truth-tracking even our science really is, why would you even want to suggest that law and sentencing guidelines are truth-tracking?

I read it simply as faith that an administrative body was going to do the right and good and best thing - which perhaps may be shocking to some by coming out of a dissent by Justice Thomas.  

The sentencing commission is a body working for the judiciary, selected by the president and confirmed by the senate.  You can read [a little more here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Sentencing_Commission) or [here](http://www.ussc.gov/About_the_Commission/Overview_of_the_USSC/USSC_Overview.pdf) (PDF).  About empiricism, the guidelines [began with a data driven foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines#Promulgation_and_modification).  Even today, the sentencing commission [releases data](http://www.ussc.gov/Research_and_Statistics/Federal_Sentencing_Statistics/FSA_Amendment/2013-04_USSC_Prelim_Crack_Retro_Data_Report_FSA.pdf) (PDF).  Always remember, though, that the guidelines and the commission are governed by underlying enabling legislation.  Also, data may exist but interpretation of the data is an important second step.

Now, it is also important to note that Congress tried making the guidelines mandatory once.  And SCOTUS said: now that would cause Sixth Amendment right to trial problems.  So now they're ""just"" advisory.  And Congress may threaten to change the enabling legislation as well.  

So, truth in sentencing?  What is truth in sentencing?  It is still the result of the agreement of a commission.  A commission guided by legislation.  And as we know, there are constituencies to appease in decision making, log rolling, and other forms of negotiation that may dilute any drive for a pure accuracy goal.","2_1_1_1"

I think it traces more back to the generalization of their statutory and constitutional interpretation views - that is, the ""conservative"" justices tend to be more literal and textualist, while the ""liberal"" justices are looking more at intent, modern context and actual effects.

The conservatives have a fair point on this issue: the SCOTUS has said that the USSG is only a recommendation, is not binding on the judge, and does not even create a presumption of reasonableness in the sentence. The changes to the USSG don't, literally, change the punishment that the defendant was susceptible to - the law in question at the time and now had the same maximum potential penalties attached, and the sentencing judge theoretically could give the exact same sentence now as he could then, with the same maximum penalties available. Therefore, there is no ex post facto problem - the defendant does not face retroactive increased penalties.

But the liberals accurately point out that realistically (and by law) the guidelines are a starting point in sentencing. Before anything else, the court has to calculate the guidelines range. Judges can and do depart from the guidelines ranges - in both directions - but they absolutely do use it as a touchstone for what an appropriate sentence should be and are more likely to stay within them than to depart. And under the established SCOTUS standard for determining when increased punishment possibilities trigger the ex post facto clause - where ""sufficient 
risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered 
crimes"" exists - the guidelines increase abuts the constitutional prohibition.","2_2"

**1)Fisher v. UT-Austin- Affirmative Action** 

Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions. (Kagan, J., recused)

**2)Shelby County v. Holder- Voting Rights and Discrimination**

Essentially, as one SCOTUS writer put it: ""Shelby County will hinge on how the Justices answer the question Justice Elena Kagan asked toward the end of argument: who gets to decide when the problem of racial discrimination in voting is solved?""

Whether Congress decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution. 

**3)Hollingsworth v. Perry/Windsor v. United States- Marriage and equal protection**

Perry: 
(1) Whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the State of California from defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman; and (2) whether petitioners have standing under Article III, § 2 of the Constitution in this case.

Windsor:
(1) Whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of the laws as applied to persons of the same sex who are legally married under the laws of their State; (2) whether the Executive Branchs agreement with the court below that DOMA is unconstitutional deprives this Court of jurisdiction to decide this case; and (3) whether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the United States House of Representatives has Article III standing in this case.
 
**4)AMP v. Myriad Genetics- Gene patents**

Whether human genes are patentable.

**5)Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl- The Indian Child Welfare Act and adoption**

(1) Whether a non-custodial parent can invoke the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (ICWA), 25 U.S.C. §§ 1901-63, to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law; and (2) whether ICWA defines parent in 25 U.S.C. § 1903(9) to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent.

**6)Salinas v. Texas- Miranda rights and Self-Incrimination**

Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendments Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendants refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.

This usually happens when a police officer is questioning a suspect during a custodial interrogation, subject to Miranda Warnings. This case (in my reading of the summary posted here) allows the prosecutor to comment on defendant's silence (as consciousness of guilt) prior to a formal custodial interrogation- my guess would be a refusal to answer questions pre-arrest, when being pulled over by an officer. 

This, IMO, creates an unduly burden on a person to affirmatively assert their right not to incriminate themselves- as the manner of speech can often be incriminating in itself (nervousness, slurred, etc.). ","4_1_1_1_1"

You have to assertively assert your Fifth Amendment right because no one knows what your answer is and why you're not answering. You have the right to not answer questions because they will be harmful to you, not because ""fuck tha police"". That's why you can be held in contempt for refusing to testify in a Grand Jury (where you recieve immunity).

It seems weird here, because the prosecutor is commenting on the statements for the same reason the Fifth should apply, but because the Fifth wasn't invoked at the time, and there was no police coercion, the statements are unprotected.

I guess that's the logic anyway.


Side note: I don't believe ""manner of speech"" would be covered by the Fifth Amendment either. If somone is arrested for DWI and they immediately slur for a lawyer, I think the cops can testify to the slurred speech. If a murder suspect has an identifiable lisp, and during questioning only asks for an attorney and then shuts up, I think the cops can comment on the lisp.

Whereas, if the accused didn't have to affirmatively assert heir 5th for it to be invoked, the police wouldn't have manner of speech. 

Here, if the accused says ""I assert my 5th"" the police can testify that he slurred, or had a lisp. If be accused stays silent, the prosecution uses that as consciousness of guilt. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. ","4_1_1_1_1_1_1"

*silence* The guy walks away.
Cop walks after him ""Do you have a gun?"" 
*silence*
Cop stops him, frisks, searches him, finds a gun.
Three outcomes:
1) Any statement would be unecessary because y'know, they find the gun. So the entire point is irrelevant.
2) There's no probable cause for the search anyway, because just because they could comment on silence being indicitive of guilt doesn't mean silence can create probable cause.
3) Silence isn't indicative of guilt anyway in this case because he's not answering ANY questions and he never offered to, and has no obligation to. He didn't just shut up when he got to the one question he didn't like.

I'm not trying to be difficult here, I'm really not, but I just can't think of a situation ever occuring where COMPLETE SILENCE will allow the prosecution to make a conciousness of guilt claim.

While only the Director has the authority to make employment decisions like the Court envisions, the Supervisor and the Manager call the daily shots, assign the workflow, and oversee all other aspects of the job. They are perfectly capable of discriminating and harassing, but because they can't hire, fire, cut pay, or whatnot, they don't face Title VII liability or subject their employer to such liability for their ""intangible"" actions.

The live blog at SCOTUSblog put it this way too, but I think it's misleading. This makes it sound as if Congress tried to establish a lesser standard by statute and then SCOTUS struck it down. Instead, the question is whether the lesser standard stated in a *different* section of the law - [the part about discriminating on the basis of race, religion, etc.](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2#m) - is also the standard that should be applied (by statute) in the section on retaliation claims.","3"

In terms of prior standards, this is the traditional rule, but Congress changed the standard by statute when it came to hiring decisions. The dispute here was whether that change also altered the way retaliation claims should be handled. 

I'm really not sure why the decision is significant, according to the opinion, even if a jury were to find that it was a motivating factor, the employer could still escape paying damages if they found that the ""but-for"" standard wasn't met. (so they'd lose the case, but pay nothing.)","4_1"

I just read the summary above and haven't read the whole opinion, but it appears to follow the same standard as before. Basically, if the employer was still going to fire you anyway, you don't get to claim retaliation for the firing. 

Now, if the right facts came along, I could see that changing, but in most cases it makes sense. I don't have the memo to refer back to, but IIRC, there is some weighing of factors that goes into the judge making that initial determination on a summary judgment motion. If the employer was firing because of say failing to meet job specifications, but the complained of reasoning for the firing was nonsensical or it doesn't follow that an employer fired the person for the stated reason, then it follows that the employer didn't retaliate and fire the employee. 

I should also add, I haven't read the change in the law they are referring to. But the retaliation claim is based on a separate Lawford the other claim. ","4_1_1_1"

My only question right now, and excuse me if those court cases answer it, is that if the EPC really protects equality, or simply the areas of discrimination that the current government finds to be worthy enough of protection?

I mean to say, the protections of race, sex, age, etc. in certain amendments and laws help to establish characteristics that *can* be discriminated on, due to omission. I can certainly see how income is separate from an individual and allows for progressive taxes and welfare cut off points, but how was that established as being a fair reason? Even if we look at specific characteristics, take the topic of Gay Marriage for instance, it still seems ""unequal"" that Consanguinity marriage can be illegal. I understand certain ""restrictions"" can exist, even on rights, but how can a couple that is blood related be denied a marriage license for that particular reason when the Supreme Court just ruled that marriage falls under the EPC? And even on top of that, why is incest illegal? Deformities harming the potential of life? Well homosexual incest can't do that. And first cousin incest only has a 6% chance of deformities (compared to the normal 3%). What's the cut off point? And why does it only apply to incest and not old age couples (50+) or people with genetic diseases that have a higher than 6% chance? And the fetus doesn't have established protections so how can it being used as a reason in this case?

There are situations where the government can discriminate, but if it does so, it needs a good reason for it.

At a minimum, all state action has to satisfy the rational basis test, which means the action has to be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. A ""legitimate state interest"" is basically anything the government can do.

From rational basis, we get to ""heightened scrutiny,"" which applies to various discrete groups. These groups don't change depending on the composition of the government, but have been identified by the Supreme Court through various opinions as deserving of more protection when it comes to discrimination. Gender discrimination is afforded intermediate scrutiny, which means an action disadvantaging a person based on his or her gender has to be substantially related to an important government interest. Race-based discrimination and national origin discrimination must meet the highest level of scrutiny, called strict scrutiny. The state action must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest. 

There are many types of classifications the Supreme Court hasn't singled out as meriting heightened scrutiny. These include age, income, and handicap. Same-sex marriage is particularly troublesome because Justice Kennedy has consistently held that the state can't discriminate based on sexual orientation, but he's never really told us what level of scrutiny applies; rather, he's identified specific instances where it's not permissible (private sexual acts and marriage, for example).

With respect to your incest hypothetical, because ""familial relationship"" or ""cosanguinity"" isn't a protected class, a law imposing cosanguinity requirements in order to obtain a marriage license is evaluated under rational basis review. This level of review is the most deferential to the government, and most of the time, the government will win. It will only lose if the method used to achieve the legitimate state interest is arbitrary or if there's no conceivable legitimate purpose for the state action. In this case, preventing child deformity through marriage of close family members would seem to be a legitimate purpose, and requiring a certain familial distance between putative spouses is rationally related to that purpose. Although you can posit ways in which the method used is over- or under-inclusive (i.e., as you have, pointing out that not all married couples will have kids, or some will be too old to do so, or genetic disease can occur at higher rates even between unrelated people), rational basis review doesn't mandate such a close fit between the method and the purpose.","2_1_6_2_1_1"

I think affirmative action gets sold this way - as something unfair, that progressives do to right societal wrongs - but I think it's misguided.

College admissions fundamentally aren't about past performance, they're about future potential.  Recognizing that some people face institutional barriers that others don't, and so might have equal or greater potential with a less impressive resume, isn't unfair.  It's not about pushing someone down to lift someone else up, it's realigning admissions incentives to be about what they always should have been about - the likelihood that a candidate will thrive in college.

Racial quotas are bad, but they've also been established as illegal, so I don't really see the problem there beyond enforcement.

Affirmative action is tricky, though, because while it certainly *benefits* some groups, it's exceedingly difficult to quantify the harm it does to others. By definition, underrepresented racial minorities make up a small percentage of admitted students (even with affirmative action policies in place) and an even smaller percentage of the applicant pool. 

The natural reaction of many to the significant disparities in admissions statistics like the ones you've provided here is indignation that a particular group is getting the short end of the stick. That's partially true--based on all available information, if affirmative action were to go away completely in favor of a numbers-only approach, more Asians would be admitted and fewer African American students would be admitted. However, what is the magnitude of the harm caused to the individual Asian applicant? The numbers suggest that, due to the respective sizes of the racial applicant pools, a numbers-only policy would not significantly increase the admissions chances of your average individual white or Asian applicant relative to current conditions.

Now, that's not to say that you can't argue affirmative action in its current form is bad policy, but you do have to be very careful making claims about how much any particular person is being screwed over. ","2_4_1_3"

It can be said with quite a bit of certainty that your friend benefitted from affirmative action policies, but it is almost impossible to determine whether you, individually, were harmed by affirmative action policies. The statistics of the situation indicate that it is much more likely that you were passed over in favor of another qualified white or Asian candidate rather than, say, a less qualified Latino candidate, and the data also suggest that you would have had a very similar chance of being rejected if affirmative action policies weren't in place. Now obviously the difference between ""affirmative action benefitted him but had little impact on me"" and ""affirmative action benefitted him and screwed me"" seems small in this case, and it's of little consolation to the individual that sees the less qualified applicant admitted (I have been there). But from a legal perspective, at least, the fact that the harm (to the extent it can be quantified) is small is important. 


Because it's impossible to know whether, had you been born a different race, you would have ended up with the same numbers and credentials, the proper question to gauge harm is not ""Would I have gotten into this school if I was black?"" The more accurate question is ""Does the fact that a black student, who likely would not have been admitted if he were white, was accepted cause any substantive harm to my admissions chances?"" Even if the answer is yes, we still then have to balance that harm against the social benefit. ","2_4_1_3_1_1"

My point is that, coming from the perspective of the individual, it's almost impossible to determine whether you were one of those applicants. 


An interesting problem is that these statistical issues are amplified at the most elite institutions, which is a byproduct of there being so few applicants of certain racial groups to begin with, but it's also the case that certain racial groups have a lower percentage of highest scoring applicants, and certain racial groups have a disproportionately high percentage. The unfortunate outcome of this is that the statistical disparities are greatest at institutions where people care the most about getting in, and consequently where the shafted applicants are most qualified relative to the overall applicant pool. That's why it doesn't surprise me that things are so ridiculous with the CalTech example, though I would also suggest that, because of this, CalTech may not be a great indicator of what would happen elsewhere. 

It's tough. I'm not completely satisfied by the individual harm principle, but at least in my opinion it's a stronger thread to pursue than the more abstract social harm angle.

If Asian Americans got admitted to schools based on test scores and grades alone, whites would be even worse off. Whites would get their asses kicked across the board. The Sessions DOJ has *no interest* in seeing Asians take the place of white people at elite schools. They would never let that happen.

Political reps who don't like them end up controlling all the power and calling all the shots. People who don't like them buy up the resources and have all the lobbying power. Affirmative action helps correct that by leapfrogging disadvantaged community members into positions of power.

other elite schools actually abused AA because racial diversity was actually more ""visible"" than socioeconomic diversity so they focused almost exclusively on race to admit blacks and Latinos. this basically just gave a huge advantage to rich blacks/Latinos while harming poor blacks/latinos. the exact opposite of the goal you claim to be trying to fix.

It's not arbitrary. Affirmative action is a systemic solution. The point of systemic solutions is to fix systemic problems. Hmong Americans experience those systemic problems. Pacific Islander Americans experience those systemic problems. Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Americans don't.

I don't just care about socioeconomic quality. I've been clear that affirmative action's benefit is uplifting disadvantaged communities by giving members of those communities an edge.

As I've stated throughout this thread AA as it is practiced in many elite universities gives the most advantage to suburban blacks and latinos who lived a life free of the ""systemic problems"" you outlined. this doesn't fix the ""systemic problem"" at all and might make things worse. 

&gt;The question is whether a population is suffering a markedly disparate consequence of that racism that affirmative action can help fight against.

Okay and how does giving rich suburban blacks and Latinos the greatest advantage out of all minority groups fix this? once again the portion of pell-grant eligible students at UCLA and Berkeley are 38% and 37% compared to Harvard's 17% with DOUBLE the black and latino enrollment at the UCs. Harvard practices racial quotas while UCLA and Berkeley don't even consider race in their admission. which institution do you feel is better at reducing the "" disparate consequence of racism"" here?

your entire point is that we should only care about black and Latinos because of ""systemically"" poor ""socioeconomic quality"".

Following Reconstruction, Jim Crow happened and black political representation went in the toilet.

No other racial demographics have been screwed over. Affirmative action hasn't caused any demographics to miss out on housing loans. It hasn't caused any wave of poverty. It certainly hasn't resulted in a mirror image result of mass incarceration for white people or Asians.

Affirmative Action doesn't even apply to politics. There's no quota to what a statehouse or congress should look like. It isn't even that obvious that AA would have any major effects on getting more minorities elected in the legislative bodies, compared to affirmative policies that would just target the poors.

Besides the logic is different. People who are elected to a legislative body aren't chosen because they're the best, or because they scored the highest on an exam, they were elected to be representatives of the people.

Second, with the development of group science over the last 50 years including group dynamics/optimization, there are two factors that make a 'group' 'fit'; ability and diversity of participants. Diversity actually trumps ability. This is according to the latest complexity science, and is concerning the function of problem-solving. Diverse frames of reference can 'ladder effect' the group up to the solution, where a more homogenous group would fail. 

This could colloquially be referred to as the difference between 'group think', and 'the wisdom of crowds'. Non-homogony facilitating the latter.

Lastly, is the political angle. Minorities aren't the only ones suffering. Everyone is suffering, and not just in the Buddhist sense of the word. 

The richest, like, 6-people in the world took another trillion dollars from the rest of us in only the last two years, according to the data [cite needed]. 

That loss of money isn't just from 'minorities', ethnic or other, that's every body. Now, I got my undergraduate degree from a predominantly caucasian University. So, I got to hear a lot of bitching about affirmative action, these white undergrads felt comfortable enough to express their views; like it was literally robbing good people from the university, and the military etc., like it was this really bad public policy.

The reality is that it's not. That's a statistical fact. The numbers themselves of these programs are statistically insignificant. But, people are suffering and they don't know where it's coming from so they complain about the thing(s) that are easy to understand. 

What I am essentially saying is that there are a lot of white people suffering, from the entire middle class on down, regardless of race, and inclusive of all. They are all losing wealth at an already high and increasingly accelerating rate and they don't understand where it's coming from. 

A process of identifying possible contributory agents, blaming those identified possible causal agents and discussing them, to hopefully tease out answers is a methodical scientific process, that has value, and seems to be somewhat of what is happening, in this regard. But affirmative action is not the problem. Richard Thaler in his book inequality helps articulate the more germain, deeper problems, including outlining the landscape quite thoroughly for the reader to make their own decisions based on abundant eveidence evidence, and diverse points of view. 

But, despite affirmative action's non culprate status, and actually beneficial status, it's dismantling is low-hanging political fruit. Many of the middle class and down self-identified 'white' American citizens will be happy if this goes the way of the dodo-bird. 

But, it's just empty calories. It's surgery political calories with no real benefits, only costs. 

It's bad public policy to eliminate affirmative action. That's science, maybe some modification to expand and optimize affirmative action would be best. Doing this would increase GDP, concerning (our) America's third product after goods, and services; solutions. The solutions market. 

Increasing that aggregate output (solutions GDP) is some of the most critical lowest-input highest-output public policy we can enact. And doing the opposite to that critical policy function would have equally large outcomes. Only in the negative.

Everyone is suffering. The minorities, the majorities, everyone who isn't in the minute upper-class. I understand undergraduate frustration at seeing affirmative action. White people are suffering and they don't really understand where it's coming from. 

Imo it would be a betrayal of those suffering white Americans (and everyone), if through supreme court action, American affirmative action policies are taken away, as a misdirection tactic, so that the real reasons all non-upper class citizens are suffering, and watching our wealth disappear, can continue.

On the other more optimistic hand, some kind of optimization in affirmative action would be great; from the mechanisms we currently use to achieve diversity in our public and private organizations, to optimization in the kind of diversity we are seeing as an output of these functions. 

This critical affirmative action public policy specifically increases the 'solutions GDP', something we don't currently measure, and unfortunately the maxim 'if it isn't measured it doesn't improve' holds here as well. But if we can optimize this facet of our social systems, we can see huge net positive outcomes. Enormous.

Public policy is a critical node in our social system, and this branch of public policy is a critical-node in a critical-node. Optimizing it has extraordinarily exponentially large potential outcomes. And butchering it can have equally large outcomes, in the opposite direction. 

This is all based on science. If anyone can cite the group-'ability and diversity' science I'd appreciate it. I thought it was in my behavioral science class but it's not, and I'm about to sleep, so I'll have to cite it when I wake up, otherwise.

Your characterization here is kind of obviously the purpose of the old Seattle ruling.  In that case it was busing students from one school district to others to integrate schools.  In Michigan it was using racial preferences in college admissions.  The holding of Seattle essentially was programs of that sort are immune to interference from the citizens of a state.  

rdavidson24 explained very well in another post about why Breyer's concurrence intelligibly distinguishes the current case from the precedents (the admissions process was not political for various reasons).  So I wouldn't argue he's wrong in what he says, but I think he is wrong about the essential purpose of the political process doctrine in Seattle, which was to make certain classes of political activism immune from interference by state governments or voters.

That's not a just outcome in my mind. It creates an race-to-the-schoolhouse preference.  If I want my school to offer my kids this or that benefit, I can just harass them with letters and informal petitions ahead of their next meeting. Why bother voting in an open, public election? That's for suckers. Under *Seattle,* whatever scheme I and my school board cooked up over the course of a few months is now the law of the land.

I disagree. In *Hunter* and *Seattle*, the defendants were shifting the locus of decisionmaking from a body in which there were enough minority voters to pass legislation/policy said voters wanted, to a larger body with a different demographic makeup in which said voters could no longer get their way.

Even assuming that the Board of Regents did have some involvement in affirmative action policy, they're statewide elected officials. The constitutional amendment in question is also a statewide thing. Precisely the same set of voters. 

The way I see it, any way you slice it, the dissent is incorrect. Either the real locus of decisionmaking is a set of unelected administrators (in which case it isn't really a political process question at all) or exactly the same set of voters that votes for the Board also voted for the amendment (so there's been no shift at all).

True, in that private universities are not ""state actors"" subject to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Constitution.

However, it should be noted that there are still federal (and state) civil rights statutes that dictate private school's actions to a lesser degree.  Also, private schools that accept government grants or wish to offer federal student loans (i.e. almost every private university in the U.S.) must accept some additional constraints on their actions.

At the bottom of page 22 of the Supreme Courts lengthy opinion barring the use of race in college admissions, is a curious three-sentence footnote.

The footnote carves out an exception to the landmark ruling: While nearly all colleges and universities must stop all practices of affirmative action in admissions, the nations military academies can continue because of potentially distinct interests, the majority opinion states.

The military academies  federally subsidized institutions of higher education designed to train future generations of military leaders  didnt ask for a special exception. Indeed, as the Supreme Court was hearing arguments in Students for Fair Admissions v. the University of North Carolina and Students for Fair Admissions v. President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, the Department of Defense submitted a friend-of-the-court brief outlining why the use of affirmative action at the academies and civilian colleges alike helps contribute to diverse military leadership, and why that matters. 

Each year, about 3,500 students graduate from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland; the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York; the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado; the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York; and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Connecticut. When they graduate, theyre commissioned as officers into the military.

Obama is a good example of why AA is a good thing.

Also, you can't assume that affirmative action only helps minority students that get admitted. Take for example, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas's own experience with affirmative action. You may not agree with his political views, but he is no doubt extremely intelligent and capable, with arguably the sharpest technical legal mind on the Supreme Court bench. He believed that affirmative action hurt him at Yale Law School because his classmates assumed he was only there because of AA, and didn't have the merit to be admitted otherwise. After graduation this continued. In his words, the degree ""meant one thing for whites, and one thing for blacks...it was discounted."" Economist Thomas Sowell has offered similar sentiments. He felt that as a professor, students assumed he was an AA hire, and were often surprised to find out that he authored the textbook they were using. Of course, these are just anecdotal points, but the whole theory motivating affirmative action is anecdotal. There is no actual evidence of the idea that giving preferential treatment in admissions to minority students has the cascading affect of lifting the connected social network. There's no evidence of that. If you're going to use anecdotes to advance a point, you have to consider opposing anecdotes as well.","1_1_1_2_2"

But doesn't race factor into the definition of socioeconomic status? If it's part of the definition that feeds into affirmative action, then that makes race a factor. So are you saying that colleges should be able to consider race as a factor in admissions?

Unless you're prepared to argue that a black kid whose parents make $100k has no disadvantage relative to the white kid whose parents make $100k, then we still have to incorporate some kind of race consciousness in affirmative action, or eliminate affirmative action altogether (to include preference for children of poor, uneducated, etc.).","1_2"

I'm prepared to argue that there's not enough of a meaningful disadvantage to give them an artificial 'boost'. You're talking about something where, during interviews, consideration of the fact is straight-up illegal. And in a country where genuine racial discrimination is - while still existent a bit - far *far* less frequent than other kinds of discrimination.

Or to put it another way, it's far more likely someone would be denied admission because they like children's cartoon shows than because of their skin colour.","1_2_1"

You have the stats on that? Every study I've seen shows that when comparing black households to white households and correcting for income, black households live in worse neighborhoods, are more likely to be victims of crime, are more likely to be stopped by police, are less likely to get job interviews, etc. Their kids, even though they're less likely to use drugs and alcohol as their white peers, are more likely to get arrested or convicted for those crimes.

Even corrected for income, black households have more difficulty building generational wealth, because they have less access to the social/professional networks as similarly situated white peers, because their homes don't gain in value as quickly, etc. In fact, black families have to be conscious of social phenomena like white flight (and are left holding the bag if their property values plummet), without being able to reap the benefits of gentrification when the opposite happens. The result is that black families have to work harder to send their kids to decent schools.

And as a result of overtly racist policy (especially in housing, but also in education and employment), black wealth is pretty much by definition nouveau riche, so even the very wealthy black people are not in a similar socioeconomic status as many of their similarly wealthy white peers. 

The system is still mildly racist, and has lasting effects from its *very* racist past. It's worth fixing in race conscious ways.

So *if* socioeconomic affirmative action should be practiced in college admissions, almost any definition of socioeconomic status would require consideration of race, or proxies for race. The problem with using proxies for race, though, is that you'd need to start collecting more detailed, more sensitive information about your applicants, like ""did your grandparents own their own homes,"" or ""what are your parents' highest academic degrees,"" or ""list the zip codes you've lived in and the years you lived in them."" Some useful information wouldn't be available to most applicants (like net worth or annual incomes of grandparents). And schools would have to cross reference their applications with things like crime rates, educational performance, etc., for different race-blind demographics, in order to capture the difference between races. It's certainly possible, and I think schools would end up doing it if affirmative action were prohibited, but what, in the end, would be the effect? Texas already has a race-blind (and indeed, SAT-blind and GPA-blind) system that filled something like 85% of its incoming class the year Abigail Fisher applied to UT Austin. That's the kind of stuff the schools would apply in order to avoid becoming all-Asian.","1_2_1_1"

For instance, if a student at a failing inner city school get Bs and As in everything, they are almost certainly more intelligent and hardworking than an average straight A student at a top private school. 

I won't comment on the situation in America as I'm British. But I can tell you that there is quite a lot of evidence over here that students with slightly worse grades from significantly worse schools statistically  outperform 'objectively' better students once they get to university. And major law firms are now all moving away from a rigid contextless assessment of grades to looking holistically at how well a student did in the context of their socio-economic background and quality of schooling. 

Lots of people whine about this letting in 'inferior' people, but really it is about identifying superior potential over privileged spoon fed students. And the key is that in Britain it isn't really racially oriented because we don't have the same race issues as the States. ","1_3_3_1"

1) You can't improve equality by playing with a discriminatory tool. You will just push the inequality in one way or another, punishing someone else (like the Asians are being punished by current AA).

For example: the son of a very successful and rich pop singer will be considered as privileged, exactly as the son of a rich and educated CEO. Nevertheless, maybe is his father clueless about education. If you are holding the singer's son to a higher standard than the son of a teacher (who is coming from a lower socioeconomic status, but will be helped by his parents in doing his homework and acquire a broader cultural knowledge), you are unfairly punishing him because of his father.

2) Even if the tool exists to improve a former unfair situatio, the beneficiary of such discriminatory tool will suffer because of the label given by this tool. 

Today, many people are considering that a black student who went to Harvard wasn't probably as good as an Asian fellow student in Harvard. Black students are the victim of this label. If you move AA to socioeconomic status, the label will just move to students coming from poor backgrounds.

I think there's huge room between not granting race a specific advantage and not considering race at all. If a black applicant's essay about a run-in with the police in light of recent events, should they not be allowed to consider the fact that the applicant has a higher likelihood of being shot or arrested by the very fact that they are black? A white kid's run-in with the police would probably not have nearly as much of an effect on them.

It hasn't been proven, although both sides agree that there is at least a little mismatch as far as STEM education is concerned. There is also some evidence for law school mismatch, although that's more hotly contested. 

Academics who don't think mismatch exists propose several arguments for why the data doesn't show the whole story (for example, one commonly relied on study for pro-mismatch academics shows that affirmative action admits are more likely to switch to non-STEM majors after their first year. Anti-mismatch academics argue that at least some of the STEM mismatch derives from the fact that affirmative action admits are less likely to have taken college-level science courses [AP] simply because they aren't offered in many inner city schools, and therefore don't really know what college-level science is like, which is why so many declare interest in STEM, only to switch when they take their first STEM classes.)

I'm not sure where I fall on this, I don't think the data backing up mismatch is very conclusive yet, and the definitely needs to be more research but its a hotly debated topic.

Edit: The main controversy around mismatch theory is whether AA is a net benefit or net loss. Everyone agrees that some AA admits will be unprepared and some will meet the level of the other students.

In law school, where a bunch of academically identical students are forced to duke it out on a very strict curve, being a less academically proficient student can be a huge blow to the ego. Which is ironic because such a student might be at the top of the class in a less competitive school.

I think there would be a few less minority professionals with out AA (but probably not much less). But I think removing AA would go a long way to boosting the confidence of minority students when they saw role models who had succeeded without the benefit of AA. And, perhaps most importantly, it would remove any excuse for people to doubt the merit of a minority professional's success.

The purpose of AA is to even the playing field over centuries of widespread discrimination that have left minorities in position of weakness in regards to long-term ""generational"" success.

For instance as a comparative example, take a family that started generating oil 150 years ago and has amassed a fine endowment of wealth that will last generations. Each member of this family has access to a wide network of wealth and contacts that will provide a cushion in the case of individual familial failure. Now compare this to ""new money"" - say a middle class child that becomes a doctor. Statistics show that this new money family is likely to lose all of their wealth in about three generations. There is no cushion to protect this family's wealth.

AA is designed to generate and provide a cushion for minority interests so each generation isn't fighting the same battles. Of course this leaves current generation whites in an impossible situation. It may be too difficult to explain to someone that they must bear the burden of their predecessor's sins (like taking advantage of a discriminating culture) as it is no fault of the current generation. However, as a society, we must not lose focus of the fact that without AA and other such programs, our minority neighbors that are just starting to build wealth may slide backwards and we will be left with the same discriminatory issues as 100 years ago.","4"

Concepcion. With these cases, the Supreme Court is effectively giving companies the ability to cheat consumers out of small amounts of money, one at a time, because there is no rational way for the consumer to redress it. If AT&amp;T overbills you by $1, it is irrational for you to sue AT&amp;T because the costs associated with the suit would far exceed your recovery. This may seem like nothing to you (""Meh, it's only a dollar...""), but AT&amp;T has millions of customers. They could obtain millions of dollars by cheating customers out of $1 or less at a time.

The only rational way for a suit to take place to stop this is with a class action, where the transactional costs of lawsuits can be spread across the thousands of cheated customers. With Italian Colors and AT&amp;T v. Concepcion, the Court has said that companies can put one sentence of boilerplate language in your contract and completely foreclose this avenue.

The Court bases this opinion on the ideas of waiver and freedom of contract - namely, that you're free to get services elsewhere. I don't see this as sufficient, because a) laypersons do not understand the implications of arbitrations, b) laypersons do not typically understand what a class action is or what benefits it provides, and c) there is really no bargained for exchange on this waiver (i.e., the consumer gets nothing out of it).

Most consumer contracts today are contracts of adhesion. They are non-negotiable and not editable. Hell, any minimum wage contract is as well. 

However the courts continue to act as though these boilerplates can be negotiated, in part or in full. And these types of holdings continue to reinforce the incentive for companies to have boilerplate contracts. 

I think there needs to be a split in contract law, and we need to formalize the concept of ""boilerplate contract"" and changes the rights and responsibilities around it. They're not *really* contracts of adhesion, since they wouldn't be abusive if the law would simply recognize the ""take it or leave it"" nature of them, and that often they are for goods or services that can't be negotiated on picayune contract terms. 

Essentially, boilerplate contracts *must* exist, because attempting to allow anyone who works for Wal-Mart to edit the contract would bring the company to a grinding halt. So given that boilerplate contracts must exist, then they should be treated differently.

Thanks for pointing that out. I'm wrong to lay this problem at the feet of the Supreme Court, though I wish they had some more sense about this. Let's keep in mind that one of the big motivators behind this decision (probably the biggest motivator, actually) is the Federal Arbitration Act. The FAA gives enormous power to arbitrators and arbitration contracts, it turns your legal rights into ""a matter of contract."" It seems as though you could agree to *any* form of arbitration, with any rules, and waive any procedural right. This is due to the FAA, not necessarily (or solely) due to the courts.

So, on the one hand, I wish the Court would just accept that there are rights that are so important to civil justice that they can't be waived without an express, knowing waiver. On the other, I wish Congress would amend or repeal the FAA, and replace it with something that recognizes the power disparities inherent in these situations.","2_1_1"

There's a very large body of scholarly opinion that believes the narrow majority of the court has, again and again, relied on 'discovered' law rather than the actual text OR intent of the Federal Arbitration Act as it was passed in the early 1900's. There is nothing in the FAA that demands state remedies relying on traditional defenses to contract be invalidated as they were in the big case before this one (Concepcion); rather, that was something the court found to be an implicit part of the FAA, despite the saving clause being quite vague and therefore able to be broadly interpreted as including those remedies itself, at the federal level.

Clauses like this one aren't read as license for the courts to develop new equitable remedies. 9 U.S.C. 2 just make arbitration clauses generally enforceable (formerly, they were subject to inconsistent treatment by courts), while still subject to traditional defenses to contract formation and enforcement. There's no hint here that Congress wanted the courts to develop a new equitable treatment like ""effective vindication doctrine"" when arbitration clauses are economically disadvantageous to one party *ex post*.

I think Kagan's dissent points to a better argument: Sherman act claims shouldn't be treated as claims under the contract at all (and thus aren't subject to the arbitration agreement), because a qui tam plaintiff has the United States behind it as a real party in interest, and the US didn't subject itself to the arbitration clause.","3_2_1_1"

If this was Congress's intent, then they should not have added the line that I bolded - because that line has absolutely, certifiably zero effect today.

He has now given it the equivalent of constitutional ""strict scrutiny"" treatment. Do most contracts automatically trump any and all other state and federal laws? I think not. So instead, he rewrote the statute from the bench to his liking.

*Concepcion* was a much closer issue than today's ruling, because the California common law rule limiting anti-class-arbitration clauses was clothed in standard contract-formation rule of voiding ""unconscionable"" clauses. Reasonable minds can disagree on whether the state law should be preempted or not.

I don't think that's true of the law struck down in today's ruling: ""effective vindication"" doctrine was specifically limiting the effectiveness of arbitration clauses in a way not specified in the FAA.

The FAA does indeed put arbitration on par with other contract terms: we don't void terms in contracts because judges find them one-sided. Unless you mean that we normally limit the freedom of contract by regulation, which Congress preempted with the FAA.

Both yield guaranteed defeat for a law - that was my point.

The distinction made between this case and the Rust/abortion case is pretty thin. It also seems to me that the ruling only applies to the ""Policy Requirement"" (government can't compell them to pass a policy) and has nothing to do with the funding decisions the government makes--the government can still refuse to fund organizations that support prostitution. I think they could probably still defund organizations that support prostitution, even if it's just stated in their policy. 

You may disagree with it on a policy basis, but I don't see the first amendment overriding congress's spending power here. It calls into question almost every spending power case. The majority does a lot of bobbing and weaving here. They don't even go so far as to conclude it's coercion, which Scalia points out. Reading them bobbing around the holding in ""Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington"" and ""FCC v. LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA,"" where the court did a rational basis test, was kind of like watching a magic trick.

To me, it would have been a better case handled by congress or the administive agency handling the funding. Making it a first amendment case makes little sense and now we have this nonsense opinion.

You keep restating the requirement in this way. Why? 

The requirement is to adopt a policy against prostitution. This is not the same as asking it to refrain from supporting prostitution.

&gt; There is a rational nexus between giving money to an organization to fight AIDs and asking that organization to not support prostitution.

Well, I think that's a question of fact, and depends on what ""not support prostitution"" means. If it in fact means in any way to deny services to prostitutes then there is an absence of any rational nexus, because it means asking organisations to refrain from addressing a vector for the spread of HIV.

Yes. It's the difference between paying people to adopt a position and not paying people who do things you dislike.

I assume this refers to my first question to you.

The challenge had been brought by a group called Students for Fair Admissions. Its founder, conservative legal activist Edward Blum, do\[es\] not believe in systemic racism, according to an interview in the _New York Times_, and has spent years trying to weed out the concept of racial equity from American law. Less than two months after his legal victory against higher education, Blum turned to his next mark: diversity fellowships. In two querulous, virtually duplicate lawsuits, the plaintiff, American Alliance for Equal Rightsanother Blum-led outfitaccused the law firms Morrison Foerster and Perkins Coie of perpetuating rank discrimination by earmarking certain fellowships for minoritized candidates.
&gt; 
&gt; The two defendants took the challenge very differently. In a statement to CNN, Perkins Coie pledged to defend this lawsuit vigorously. Morrison Foerster, which calls itself MoFo and won a 2023 Outstanding Firm for Diversity &amp; Inclusion award from a legal research company, folded immediately and removed any specific references to race or queerness from the language of the job posting. However, their websites robust workplace-culture page, that trumpets the many faces of MoFo Diversityincluding the banner announcing their big awardremains unchanged.
&gt; 
&gt; Its common for legal professionals to extol diversity as a business asseteven if they cave as soon as someone holds their feet to the fire. Virtually every firm in Canada and the US has a Diversity and Equity tab on its website professing similar values. But attempts to move beyond mere lip service have historically been fraught. While big-law fellowships might look like an oddly specific thing to challenge, the move to weed out equitable hiring feeds into a much longer history of exclusion, one that has long shaped the legal profession in North America. As much as the field keeps saying it wants to change, its reaction in the face of controversy often suggests something different.
&gt; 
&gt; The demographics are already abysmal. According to the American Bar Associations 2020 survey, 86 percent of all lawyers in the US were white. The Canadian Bar Association doesnt keep comparable national figures. But 2019 statistics provided by various provincial law societies show that white lawyers made up an estimated 74.9 percent of those who practised in Ontario; in British Columbia, 16.15 percent of lawyers identified as a visible minority; and in Nova Scotia, 22 percent identified as members of an equity-seeking group. The high proportion of whiteness isnt the result only of passivity or the failure to recruit more diverse candidates. Its the remainder of deliberate historical attempts to bar women and people of colour from the profession.","4"

(Also, the difference in merit-based scores is *substantial*, not minor, stepping outside of Harvard specifically to look at numbers from a combined pool of top colleges, for equal chances, an Asian applicant has to score *over 400 points* higher than a black student; that steps outside of 'diversity is beneficial' into the realm of 'patently unfair and offensively discriminatory'). 

And again, all of this occurs in the backdrop of their stubborn insistence on maintaining class structures... if instead of race they dropped legacy preference, gave socioeconomic preference and a couple other race-neutral preferences like children of single parents, you know, *actual* disadvantages, they'd wind up *more* racially diverse, without looking at race specifically. But it will be a cold day in hell before they stop being institutions primarily concerned with maintaining a privileged elite class.","2_1_1_1_3"

That's what Harvard says, and I believe that they honestly believe that. But imagine a similar fact pattern:

* Atlanta State's recruiting department maintains a policy of differential recruiting based on religion. Protestant students are recruited starting at a 1100 SAT score, but Catholic students require a 1200 SAT score and Muslim students a 1300 SAT score before the recruiting department will send out mailers. (Harvard's numbers were 1100 for URMs, 1350 for Asian women, and 1380 for Asian men.)
* The admission statistics show a similar differential. The average Protestant admit has a 1250 SAT, the average Catholic admit 1300, and the average Muslim admit 1350. (SFFA alleges that a survey produced numbers on the 2400 scale of 2107 for black admits, 2142 for Native American admits, and 2299 for East Asians and Indians).
* Atlanta State says that there's no relationship at all between these two points. Unlike recruiting staff, admissions staff never discriminate based on religion because they're trained not to. The cause of the discrepancy is just that the school finds Muslim students to be less personable on average. (It's undisputed that Harvard has a ""personal rating"" which Asians tend to get worse scores on - SFFA claims that this rating is the vehicle for discrimination against Asian applications, while Harvard claims that this rating is a neutral qualification and thus should be controlled for in any statistical analysis.)

&gt;Narrow tailoring also requires that the reviewing court verify that it is ""necessary"" for a university to use race to achieve the education benefits of diversity.  This involves a careful judicial inquiry into whether a university could achieve sufficient diversity without using racial classifications.

He then goes on to say the money quote: 

&gt;The reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity.

This eviscerates the standard set forth in Grutter (where Kennedy dissented).  The standard in Grutter was that the courts should give universities a ""degree of deference"" in how best to implement policies designed to promote a diverse student body.  In Fisher, Kennedy is completely destroying that, and returning to a hard ""strict scrutiny"" test rather than the kind of ""strict scrutiny with deference"" test that O'Conner stated.

I think there is absolutely **no way** any school is going to be able to meet this standard.  Even facially race-neutral laws with the intent of discriminating on the basis of race are struck down.  How would it be possible to implement a diversity program without the intent to discriminate based on race?  That's going to be VERY hard to achieve for schools.  

I think this great quote from Ginsberg citing Thomas Reed Powell sums everything up nicely:

&gt;If you think that you can think about a thing inextricably attached to something else without thinking about the thing which it is attached to, then you have a legal mind, Powell said, prompting Ginsburg to add, Only that kind of legal mind could conclude that an admissions plan specifically designed to produce racial diversity is not race conscious.","3"

With *Fisher*, the Court is trying to lay down a clear line - the Court will defer to the schools in linking the goal of diversity with their program, but the schools must show that all other alternatives were exhausted before the race based program was initiated.

If the standard is read that way (which I assume is how the liberal wing chose to read it), then schools can show that the other options were either untenable or impossible to implement. That's a fair standard if you believe that affirmative action shouldn't be the first choice taken by schools, and a much clearer standard than giving a vague level of ""deference"" to schools.","3_1"

I think you're making a very good point, and that captures the reasoning of the court and Kennedy pretty succinctly.  But I don't think schools are going to cope with that burden well.  How can they foresee their exposure to litigation in the future?  

What Kennedy has done is create a very articulate legal standard that is vague in application.  What O'Conner did was create a vague legal standard that was easy for schools to apply.  In my view, O'Conner was trying to let schools do their own thing but leave courts a lot of leeway to punish deviances.

Next, for those who are wondering why Harvard is going after standing so hard, this is another suit crafted by Edward Blum in his never-ending quest to eliminate affirmative action policies that discriminate on race. 

The reason they are protecting their plaintiffs so well is because of the threats and hate that were slung at the plaintiff in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. At one point in time, the plaintiff was under 24-hour personal protection because of her suit.

Mr. Blum is an incredibly interesting character.

Similarly, if we judge kids based on school quality, we create a toxic incentive for schools at the margin to remain just bad enough that their students get to go to college. Similarly, if we penalize students from the best schools, we create a serious problem for the private school economy.

It also ignores the goal of the program. University admission isn't a tournament for children. It's not about figuring out who's 'best', or awarding 'good' lives to the 'winners' and punishing the 'losers' with 'bad' lives. Universities are enriching experiences, where kids leaving their families behind for the first time live in communities with events and organizations to help them reach out and find themselves. Living and working for four years in a diverse community has value - it teaches people not to be intimidated by or condescend to people of other races. Removing that would lessen the experience for even the white students. It would make the university worse, out of some misguided attempt to use the academy as a contest for wealth.","2_2"

In the landmark Bakke case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. 438 U.S. 265 (1978). The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court. 

Apparent from quote, but she quotes from Powell's bakke controlling plurality decision at length, so it's more of a rhetorical device, in context, than a wish, hope, prediction, or controlling deadline which people should take seriously, like how people use it. It was a rhetorical flourish, nothing more.

The part that grinds my gears is Powell, in bakke, held that only racial diversity would clearly and absolutely be unconstitutional, so actual constitutional diversity since 1977 means socioeconomic and geographic as well as race being one factor out of many, not just race but making it purely a race issue is what everybody does, it's not just a race issue bc that would be clearly unconstitutional (for 50 years).  Doing away w/ AA means no more selection for poor and rural kids of any race, of which I was one, born poor white trash on welfare and probably would have stayed there if not for AA in undergrad, which I crushed and used to go to law school.

It hasn't changed- Powell also notes how Harvard and a few other schools were already doing it this way, the constitutionally permissable way, but regents of California were not, using the quota to only considering racial diversity. That was struck down. Edit- and it's the difference between grutter and the other one that almost rhymes, Michigan undergrad had a point system that amounted to an unconstitutional quota (but also gave points to rural/poor; still an unconstitutional quota), while mich law school had factors and no point system, which was constitutional.","1_1_2_1_1"

Bakke struck down the quota the Cali system was using and defined diversity as a valid, constitutional goal only when race was one factor along with other factors like socioeconomic and geographic diversity.  You might be right, but that's not the question they answered, they said racial quotas don't survive strict scrutiny but a more wholistic diversity does.  I can pull out some quotes from bakke, but on mobile, so probably not till later.  The entirety of bakke is pretty borked, something like 4-3-2-1-1-1-1 (it adds up way past 9) but Powell's plurality is fairly straightforward and the one everything after is based on. 

Edit- and just from the headnotes, even their quota system wasn't just racial diversity, they had quota for 'disadvantaged' (poor, rural, etc) and counted minorities as 'disadvantaged' no matter if they were or not.  Challenged under EPC, California statute, and Title 6, not 7, holding title 6 applies exactly the same to colleges that take federal money (fed student loans) as EPC does to government actors. So even bakke wasn't purely racial quota, I misremembered it, still holds the Hobson's choice of: either seek diversity, but only do it wholistically in this way we've defined and delineated, or don't seek diversity at all; no middle ground for what you've proposed.","1_1_2_1_1_1_1"

&gt;Élite universities routinely tip the scales in favor of athletes, alumnichildren, and so on. Nobody in the Harvard case is challenging theconstitutionality of those practices. Only race would be eliminated as apreferred category.

Race-based distinctions are prohibited by the Constitution. The question is not what is permitted, but what is forbidden. Favoring legacy applicants or the children of big donors or world-class lacrosse players is not contrary to the Constitution. Favoring people because they are white is prohibited. Favoring people because they are not white is prohibited. It would be lawful to decide college admissions by accepting the first (or last) X number of applications postmarked within a stated window of time, or based on height or Urdu fluency or shoe size.

There is a lot of twisted and inconsistent reasoning underlying AA and the drive for racial diversity. For starters, I think everyone agrees that it wrong to attribute personal characteristics to an individual based on his race. So how exactly is it reasonable to assume that a black person favored because of his race in pursuit of diversity is in any meaningful way different from a white person? What exactly is the difference between favoring a black person based on a favorable inference (diversity) drawn from his race and disfavoring an Asian person based on an identically preconceived notion that Asians are untrustworthy? In each case the decision to favor or not is driven by nothing but the person's race.

I can see an argument for making amends to people who have been personally injured by *de jure* racial discrimination and whole-heartedly support laws forbidding it. However, the idea that a living white person should be disadvantaged in favor of a living black person as compensation for what dead white people once did to dead black people is no more rational or defensible than any other blood libel. If you know nothing of biology because your public school received only 60% of the per-pupil spending spent in other neighborhoods, it may be that you should receive remediation at public expense. You should not be awarded a place in medical school or at the bar as compensation.

Last, the article makes the common error of positing segregation and integration as legal opposites. They are not. Segregation is the compulsory separation of populations. Its opposite is desegregation - the removal of compulsion from an organizational system. If you can't live on a given street because people of your race are not allowed to live there, there is racial segregation on that street. Desegregation would allow you to live anywhere you can afford to buy or rent. Integration would require that some number of people of your race live on that street. The Constitution forbids *de jure* segregation. It does not mandate that any particular person live in any particular place.

In sum, if favoring some and disfavoring others based on race is permissible (as seems to be argued) when done with good motives, then it is always permissible when done from what are by vague consensus deemed good motives. In other words, if racial discrimination is acceptable when applied to help black people, it will necessarily be good if applied to advantage white people - provided only that some critical mass of society thinks that's a good thing.","2"

As you go on to acknowledge in your very next sentence, discrimination is not some hoary relic of the past.  It is very much alive and well today.  Is Affirmative Action the best solution to that issue?  Perhaps not, but if we're going to pretend that ever since the Fifteenth Amendment -- or even the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- everything has been a fair playing field, then we're not having an honest discussion.","2_1"

How does your framework (that they are direct opposites) address de facto segregation? Assuming we disallow overt segregation in all forms, and mitigate for historical methods of segregation both direct (Jim Crow) and indirect (red lining, etc), de facto segregation can still occur. In fact, if my memory of my Race and Law and property classes stands up, then segregation does in fact occur naturally without legal enforcement. 

In that scenario, where segregation-aimed policies are eliminated and yet some segregation still occurs, how is integration diametrically opposed?

Eh, I don't know about this. So for instance I work in a large city as an attorney and I develop legal strategy for how it manages certain issues. The constitution explicitly forbids affirmative action in at least *some* circumstances. So in a very real sense there isn't that much 'agency"" to give or to get from the judiciary. Unless a judge wants to get gunned down on some hill, he or she will just tell you you're wrong.

I'm not going to speak to what everyone might think about affirmative action, but in the realm of law all the Supreme Court justices and all the Circuits, even those who have consistently and unequivocally agreed with affirmative action, have evaluated affirmative action under strict scrutiny. They all acknowledge that the constitution forbids affirmative action in 90% of possible instances.

In the final analysis, it's hardly even a legal point. The Constitution plainly says ""equal protection."" Curing past wrongs today is implicitly not equal. If it was equal, it wouldn't fix anything

The real issue to an attorney like myself is defining what instances they are kosher. And we sort of have a kennel of what those instances are: some ""admission"" processes, some hiring processes, but not all of either, and some contracting processes. The list really is quite short and it is a clear cut issue for, again, 90% of what's possible

Eh. Even if the Executive is allowed to take certain actions, that doesn't mean said actions cannot be reviewed by the courts when a challenge is brought by a person affected by the action. Depending on the subject matter, the courts will defer to the Executive to a greater or lesser extent. For some issues, the Executive will need to survive ""strict scrutiny,"" meaning the action must be narrowly targeted at advancing a compelling state interest and must actually advance that interest. That's what the courts look for when the government is allegedly infringing on a fundamental constitutional right like the freedom of expression. 

But even at the maximal extent of its powers and on subjects that don't implicate any but the most amorphous, generalized notions of civil rights, the Executive *still* needs to prove that there is some ""rational basis"" for its actions, i.e., that the action isn't ""arbitrary and capricious"". Almost any remotely plausible explanation will do, but there still needs to be one. ""Just because"" won't cut it. 

In between, there are certain limits upon Executive action that can be imposed by the Legislature via statute, particularly when it comes to administrative actions. That's getting into the weeds, so suffice it to say that there can be and often are procedural steps an agency has to follow before it's allowed to take action. ","1"

Its one thing to prevent an illegal action and another to demand or compel continued action.

And

Potus's reasoning of perceived harm and illegality isnt capricious, id argue, and it seems counter-intuitive to compel the continuation of an illegal act. (Iirc two circuit courts decided different ways, so there is precedent on both sides, and SCOTUS deffered).

Is it common practice to infer motives alterior to those put before the court, legally speaking. The damning tweets wouldnt change the nature of the legality, particularly since its been argued and shown that potus flip flops, and doesnt follow through on what is said in different mediums od exchange. There is also precedent of sorts for public figures not being held liable for statements made - i.e. actors arent arrested for talking about how they smoke weed on Jimmy Kimmel -  and POTUS, and his twitter, would be that of an established character/actors, both of which predate the presidency, given his history (and history of tweets even while in office)?

No. It is not. 

Look, that a court enjoined the termination of DACA came as a surprise to pretty much everybody. Obama imposed it by fiat, so there was every expectation that Trump could rescind it by fiat. Only not, Because Reasons. 

All of which to say that yes, the courts' collective responses to various Trump executive actions is largely unprecedented and reflects a major departure from existing jurisprudence on the review of such actions.

That's not really what happened, at least to my understanding. The objectors claimed they had some right (likely due process I suppose) which would be infringed if DACA is repealed, and the court issued a stay of the repeal while the litigation proceeds. The stay was issued because they government offered no real explanation as to why it shouldn't be issued.

also, i'm not objecting to Bakke's precedent in the slightest. i'm concerned only  programs, like University of Michigan's office of undergraduate admissions in Gratz v Bollinger. that is, i'm only considering whether pursuit of diversity, when it actually conflicts with the 14th, should be acceptable. not whether diversity is a good. diversity surely and without constitutional conflict be pursued through holistic considerations of applicants - where race is one of many factors admissions officers will look at. i don't believe that conflicts with the 14th. you're not being considered on the basis of your race or national origin but on a whole slew of qualities including race. you're being judged on this whole set. as long as race or national origin doesn't tip the balance such that you are being accepted or denied for that reason, it's a constitutionally acceptable way to pursue diversity. that involves no balancing of interests.

the idea is something like - if we have to have subjective standards, we should have the most widely accepted ones possible. the way to do that is to have standards which assume as little as possible. the want of diversity, for example, is much harder to agree upon than whether or not we want the nation to exist 5 or 10 years down the road. 

someone here mad the argument that in some cases at least, diversity is in fact integral to the nation's existence. we'd need a more thorough empirical discussion to really get to the bottom of that. but even if that's true, the point remains: if we must have subjective standards, then we must have the least assumptive standards with the strongest possibility for consensus.

And secondly, that would suggest that a government should oppress or otherwise harm the citizens of its country if that ensures the continued existence of the government, which runs counter to our  shared American values laid out in the declaration of independence. 

I would suggest that a government should not be concerned with its own survival so much as it should be concerned with the well-being and stability of the population, which arguably comes from as many citizens as possible having economic prosperity and a feeling of investment in society, a goal which is arguably best met when the population is able to work to its full potential. Based on that, and knowing that historical legally enshrined racism has put minorities today at a disadvantage - remember, there are people alive today who can remember ""colored"" and ""white"" water fountains and race riots - we can conclude that minorities are an underutilized population who may score lower in academics through no real fault of their own. As such, giving them a slight advantage in college admissions, since college degrees are directly correlated with higher lifetime earnings and upward social mobility is a reasonable action to improve utilization of those populations. The end result should be a net improvement in economic prosperity and social investment of citizens, which leads to social stability and well-being, all of which collectively creates a compelling reason for the state to allow affirmative action policies.","2_1_2_1_1_1_1_2"

&gt; Its a landmark civil rights issue, Rosenbaum said. **It is not about the constitutionality of affirmative action**; it is a bigger story than that. Its about access to the political process. It is about whether or not a popular initiative can cut minorities  people of color  out of the political process.

The MI SC didn't talk about the law and whether or not the merits of it were constitutional. It's more of a commentary about how easily the MI Constitution is being amended (there were 6 proposed constitutional amendments in November). 

For example, let's say I -- being a representative of a wealthier portion of society -- try to pass an amendment by referendum saying, ""people with green skin can't vote"" (for purposes of this, people with green skin are generally less well off). I fund it, get a serious movement going with offices across the state and many, many volunteers and paid staffers. It eventually gets on the ballot. How are the green skinned people suppose to fight the movement to amend the constitution when they have less resources and are less able to match the force that I can muster? The deck is stacked against them simply because they aren't as political savvy as myself. And because it's a constitutional amendment -- the supreme law of the land -- it's not as easy as simply lobbying a congressperson and trying to influence legislation.

It's a really interesting point, and one I haven't heard before in the context of the 14th amendment. It's absolutely an interesting case to read and I have no idea what would happen if the Supreme Court were to grant cert as I don't believe the court's addressed this on point before.

And the reason it won't affect *Fisher* is because this MI case wasn't decided on the merits of the law, but how the law came into being. *Fisher* is an appeal on the merits of affirmative action.

groups of the equal protection of the laws when it: (1) has a racial focus, targeting a
policy or program that inures primarily to the benefit of the minority; and
(2) reallocates political power or reorders the decisionmaking process in a way that

special burdens on racial minorities

I'd read the opinion in full, but that seems to be a key paragraph regarding your question. Affirmative action is a program that has a ""racial focus"" intending to benefit minorities.

1995's *Lopez* and 2000's *Morrison* were ""conservative"" opinions that curb-stomped the Gun-Free School Zones Act (not an appropriate use of federal commerce-clause authority) and Violence Against Women Act (ditto on commerce).

In [2005's *Raich*](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/supreme_court_dispatches/2004/11/dude_wheres_my_integrity.html), [O'Connor, Rehnquist](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-1454.ZD.html), and even Thomas ([yes, really](http://web.archive.org/web/20050804174843/http://wid.ap.org/scotus/pdf/03-1454P.ZD1.pdf)!) argued in favor of marijuana based on those two earlier cases. The staunchly anti-drug states of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi filed amicus briefs supporting Raich's right to marijuana free from Federal meddling.

 **Alas, they weren't in the majority, hence this case's non-landmark status.** 
Here's Thomas's separate dissent:

&gt; Respondents Diane Monson and Angel Raich use marijuana that has never been bought or sold, that has never crossed state lines, and that has had no demonstrable effect on the national market for marijuana. If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually anythingand the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.

&gt; Respondent's local cultivation and consumption of marijuana is not ""Commerce... among the several States.""

[...]

&gt; Certainly no evidence from the founding suggests that ""commerce"" included the mere possession of a good or some personal activity that did not involve trade or exchange for value. In the early days of the Republic, it would have been unthinkable that Congress could prohibit the local cultivation, possession, and consumption of marijuana.

[...]

&gt; If the Federal Government can regulate growing a half-dozen cannabis plants for personal consumption (not because it is interstate commerce, but because it is inextricably bound up with interstate commerce), then Congress' Article I powers  as expanded by the Necessary and Proper Clause  have no meaningful limits. Whether Congress aims at the possession of drugs, guns, or any number of other items, it may continue to ""appropria[te] state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.""

&gt; If the majority is to be taken seriously, the Federal Government may now regulate quilting bees, clothes drives, and potluck suppers throughout the 50 States.

Could you link to this commentator and/or elaborate? I don't recall originalists having a problem with judicial review in general...

Here's the article, from the Antonin Scalia School of Law, no less.

And you're absolutely right that originalism does not *necessarily* line up with the countermajoritarian difficulty, but that's the trend we've seen in the last few decades. There aren't any major judges or professors (that I know of in detail) that are arguing that the original meaning of the constitution was that the courts would apply strict scrutiny to issues involving the bill of rights. As I understand it, and I am far from a legal historian, the likely ""factual"" originalist understanding, if such a thing exists or is relevant, is that they viewed the non-criminal procedure rights as just short of non-enforceable, and they were more guiding lights for Congress.

And you're right overall, I'm not an originalist so I'm not adequately capable of attacking originialism from an originalist perspective, so my argument wasn't particularly coherent as a legal argument; I was more paraphrasing the ways in which *Heller* mimics a lot of the Warren court's decisions that the conservatives of the court did not like. I'll leave the originalist argument to Justice Stevens, who made a strong case.","3_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/50mafg/what_are_some_modern_landmark_supreme_court/","DenverJr","2016-09-02",1472851609,1,1,0,0,"That was a fascinating article, thanks. I disagreed with some of his criticisms of Scalia's opinion in *Heller*, but I did think he was especially strong in discussing the analysis of the handgun ban. Scalia's analysis there, and the dicta about other gun regulations, was quite weak. But I also agree with the author's ultimate point of how an originalist should probably analyze the 2nd Amendment, i.e., he thinks the D.C. handgun ban was unconstitutional regardless.

That said, I don't agree with your summary of originalist understanding. I don't consider myself an originalist either, but with respect to the enforceability of rights, I believe the article had talked about why an originalist would not view them as unenforceable:

&gt;An alternative possibility is that courts might refuse to strike down any statute unless it is very clearly inconsistent with the Constitution.  & This approach is like living constitutionalism to the extent that it does not treat the Constitution as binding law. The main difference is that it puts the power to amend the Constitution in the legislature rather than in the judiciary.

It also had some interesting passages on *stare decisis*, which I think are relevant to what you said in your previous comment. You characterized one of the problems with *Heller* as that it made ""new law"" merely because it reinterpreted an amendment that had been unenforced for centuries. But that's not a problem at all for an originalist, and in fact would be desirable to a certain extent, as long as one is being true to the original meaning of the text. Most relevant from the article:
&gt;One reason for regarding Heller as a particularly important test of originalism is that the Court was burdened with virtually no relevant judicial precedents, and certainly with no dispositive precedents.
&gt;***
&gt;Originalists could logically argue that precedents should be given no weight at all: the Constitution is the law, and indeed the supreme law of the land, and courts are always obliged to enforce the Constitution as they understand it, rather than adhere to prior judicial mistakes. Some academic commentators have taken this position, but no Supreme Court Justice has ever done so (at least not consistently), and there is strong evidence that the original meaning of the Constitution implicitly incorporated a principle of stare decisis. 

Now, if we really want to talk about a case where Scalia ignored his purported originalist principles, I think *Raich* is the classic case there. I just took issue with your description of *Heller* as the classic case where someone ""flunked"" their purported ideological test, because while the linked article does use those words, it's more about certain sections of the opinion. I think your original post, perhaps unintentionally, implied that an originalist might *not* find that the 2nd Amendment protects an individual right, when in fact that article says the opposite.","3_1_1_1"

Sibelius* (the ""Obamacare"" case). 

Quick facts: Congress, through the ACA, enacted a huge Medicaid expansion but told states that they could either (a) accept the Medicaid expansion, which would end up requiring states to pay ~10% of additional Medicaid costs eventually (the feds cover everything for the first several years), or (b) if they refused the expanded Medicaid funding, they get zero Medicaid funding at all (including the funds that were previously available). 

The conservatives held that, even though Congress had the power to enact the law it did, and even though there were no constitutional prohibitions on the law it enacted, the conditionexpand Medicaid or lose all Medicaid fundswas ""too coercive"" on the states and had to be struck down. 

In dissent, Ginsburg noted that Congress could have achieved the exact same ends by repealing Medicaid altogether in one bill, then immediately enacting the expanded program. I'm gonna go find the opinion to type Roberts' response verbatim because I couldn't make this bullshit up: (footnote 14 of the opinion)

&gt; Justice Ginsburg suggests that the States can have no objection to the Medicaid expansion, because Congress could have repealed Medicaid [and,] [t]hereafter, . . . could have enacted Medicaid II, a new program combining the pre-2010 coverage with the expanded coverage required by the ACA. Post, at 51; see also post, at 38. But it would certainly not be that easy. Practical constraints would plainly inhibit, if not preclude, the Federal Government from repealing the existing program and putting every feature of Medicaid on the table for political reconsideration. Such a massive undertaking would hardly be ritualistic. Ibid. The same is true of Justice Ginsburgs suggestion that Congress could establish Medicaid as an exclusively federal program.

The fact is Congress is slow to react and conservative in how it reacts. Significant changes to laws are extremely rare, and the court is placed in a difficult position whenever those come up. I think the notion that you read the laws literally and apply them literally falls flat on its face when you realize how fucked up our Congress is. I would love to see a President and a Court that demands action from Congress, but I recognize that doing so would likely cause our country to have collapsed over the last two decades.

So I recognize that the court is practicing politics and not law, but its not inconsistent or bullshit. Its the same kind of politics that lead to the original rulings on the coerciveness of federal actions, and I generally support those. We can't have a federal system if the federal government has absolute power to mandate that the states do certain actions ""or else."" Now if Congress doesn't like that, they can change it. They can pass an amendment to the constitution... but they haven't.","4_1"

It's similar to a lot of early equal protection cases where the conservative dissenters would say something like ""How could it be unconstitutional to castrate robbers, but not embezzlers, when it would be perfectly constitutional to castrate both robbers and embezzlers!?"" (I don't even remember if that case had a dissenter, I'm just using it as an example.)

The answer is there's no political motivation or momentum to pass that latter law, and that's precisely the reason we got the unjust result.","4_1_1"

Roberts' reasoning is bullshit because the argument (at least in n.14) totally fails. Ginsburg says, ""Congress could just as easily put in the same bill, 'Medicaid is eliminated; we are also enacting Nedicaid, a new and expanded program,' and the only difference between that (repeal and replace) and the expansion in the ACA is purely formalistic."" Roberts responds with, ""Well Congress probably wouldn't have done that, and that presents political issues they would have to sort out.""

I hope I'm not the only one that thinks Roberts' counter-argument (which is obviously a footnote in a very very long opinion, but still) doesn't present a legal argument. Your point is well-taken that Congress *should* do a lot differently, but (1) that's not really even what Roberts is saying (he's not saying they should have done it differently, he's basically saying they never would have done it differently because ""it would certainly not be that easy,"") and more importantly (2) Congress *did* something here and it was conceded by the majority that what they did was within their Article I powers. You note that:

&gt;We can't have a federal system if the federal government has absolute power to mandate that the states do certain actions ""or else.""

But that wasn't even in issue: the program was pretty clearly within Congress's Spending Power (again, conceded by the majority) but they went on to say that there are some abstract, indeterminate limits on the powers given to the federal governments by the states through the Constitution that prevent what the federal government can do. What are those limits? Who knows! Can the federal government repeal Medicaid altogether? Can it repeal Medicare? Social Security? Under the majority opinion, the Court sorta said states are entitled to existing federal outlays and we'll separately judge additions to the programs, even though Congress is trying to change the entire program. That's potentially a revolutionary change grounded in language (the Tenth Amendment) that doesn't actually say anything.","4_2"

Keep in mind that this second part of the part case. In the first part, Roberts concludes that requiring people buy things is not a valid exercise of commerce power acts.

If you really like the notion of applying the law as written, you can just kill the whole thing right then and there. Congress does not have the power to require people to engage in commerce, and so its dead. Roberts however recognizes that this is a really important bill. It goes back 20 years or more, and for the court to strike it down over a technicality... would be bad for the Court and the Congress and really the entire political system. Chances are you would not see the Congress pass a bill like this twice in your lifetime. So he says ""ok its not commerce regulation (its commerce mandates)... but it could be a tax"" and throws it a life-line.

So sure there is inconsistency with this single opinion: In one section you say ""well it could be done this other way, so we will give you a pass"" but in this section you say ""it could have been done this other way but its wasn't, sorry"". I just don't think its bullshit. Its politics. 

I also don't think its dictated one way or another how to respond to these situations based on political idealogy. I could certainly imagine a conservative taking a strict letter of the law view on these kinds of issues, and so the complaint would be with the exception granted for the mandate part of the law. There are times when I think the law should be read more leniently in the name of justice, and other times when it should be read strictly.

The fact is that neither of these bills are likely to have passed in the alternate form that would put them ""above legal reproach"". If presented as a Tax... the ACA would have failed, New Taxes don't do well in November. Similarly the abolishment of Medicare and its replacement with CareMed.... also not going to do well in November. Which means that there is room to strike down everything, or uphold everything, or split the difference.","4_2_1"

Well that's not really accurate for two reasons. 

First, the opinion looks at two different things. In your comment, you're discussing how the Court ruled on the individual mandate. I'm talking about the Court's decision on the Medicaid expansion portion, which was a totally different holding and decision. It's in that portion of the opinion that Ginsburg (in dissent) points out that Congress could have reached the same result in a different form (but the exact same substance) and where Roberts fails to effectively respond, mostly because he's not using any kind of real ""conservative"" (as the OP describes it) analysis.

Second, it's not the case that the decision should come out the other way because the act exceeded the Commerce Power. The government argued the act *was* valid under the Commerce Power and, alternatively, under the Taxing and Spending Powers. It's not like Congress has to call its shot in terms of where an act's authority comes from; if Congress has the power to enact a law, the law stands even if Congress was mistaken about its authority. The Court decided it wasn't valid under Commerce but was valid under Taxing and Spending. I think they erred in rejecting the commerce argument, but in either case they reached the correct result as a matter of law (again, in my opinion and interpretation of the Court's precedents).

That's pretty rare on the internet, and shows that you have the potential to be a good law student.

1. To answer your question, I'd have to know what your idea of ""affirmative action"" is. What many people think of as ""affirmative action"" (i.e. quotas) has been held unconstitutional in the context of higher education. Certain forms of affirmative action have been held suspect but not per se unconstitutional (the most recent case is Fisher v. University of Texas, but you can also read Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger for a good discussion.) With respect to private companies having affirmative action plans, the Equal Protection Clause doesn't apply to non-state actors. The basic rule is that for a univeristy to consider race in admissions, such consideration must advance a compelling state interest and be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. At least, that's what I took from Fisher. I don't personally agree with the Court, but that's what they say the law is.
2. It may be. However, most gun control laws are at the state level, and we just found out the 2nd Amendment applies to the states a couple of years ago. We still haven't figured out the contours of what a state may and may not constitutionally regulate. I tend to be pretty biased as an anti-gun regulation guy, so I won't comment on this further.
3. Under existing Supreme Court precedent, content-neutral reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions are generally acceptable. Free-speech zones tend to be such a restriction: we putatitvely don't care WHAT you're saying, we just don't want you disrupting the event with your speech, so here's a place where you can get your message out. To get the justification for that rule, you'd need to read a big wodge of cases (and I don't know that I really understand it anyhow, since I don't practice in that area at all.)

Anyhow, hope that helps. Again, kudos to you for seeking answers and ascribing your lack of understanding to your own ignorance of the law.

Oh, sorry, to answer your actual questions:

&gt;Is there any concern in the legal/judicial community that regular people will see what I see, and conclude that the rules are being bent or broken? 

Some, but I generally don't worry a lot about it. I try to gently correct my friends when I see them make a gross misstatement of law or the like, but for the most part I just recognize I have years of specialized training in the law and they don't. It's roughly equivalent to a non-scientist claiming that evolution by natural selection is inconsistent with thermodynamics.

&gt;Or that the law really is inconsistent? 

Sometimes, try as we might, the law really IS inconsistent; some social classes bear the brunt of criminal laws much more harshly than others, for example. 

&gt;Or, is the focus just on getting the law right and damn what the public thinks?

There is a pseudo-mantra in law school about learning ""black letter law"" that goes something like, ""Learn the rule, then learn the exceptions, then the *exceptions* to the exceptions, and sometimes the *exceptions to the exceptions* to the exceptions.""  The general gist of it is that the law is complex because laws interact, and butt heads, and contradict each other.  So, to understand how the law operates under a given set of factual circumstances requires appreciating what other laws interact with the first law, and which law controls. 

The law is replete with contradictions and incompatibilities, which goes to the very heart of the philosophy of justice and law.  In almost every legal dispute that is not immediately clear-cut under the law, you have two (or more) opposing parties who are asserting conflicting rights or legal authority, combined with specific facts, that will settle the dispute in their favor.  Then, it is up to a judge to determine which set of laws supersedes the other, and that decision helps us understand what happens the next time a similar dispute occurs.  In that way, the law evolves through its contradictions one dispute at a time.

So there is an infinite variety of idiots who will look at a law, such as the 2nd amendment, and say, ""It says, '...the right to bear arms *shall not be infringed*' and that settles it!"" when in fact, we have not even begun the conversation.","3"

On gun control, it could be argued that the Second Amendment only applies to organized militias, as its text arguably seems to hint.  On free speech zones, it could be argued that the government is free to place a degree of limitation on where and how people can protest as long as people are still able to peaceably assemble and petition the government.

There are quite a lot of different approaches to deciding which interpretations are correct, which is why even experienced lawyers and judges often disagree on these questions.

To some extent, the same thing happens in just about every field.

I bring this up because the first line of the oath specifies enemies, and the only time the Constitution uses the word enemies is in this section when talking about treason.  Enemies also comes up in the Fourteenth Amendment, where 

&gt;No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.

Here, the ratifiers seem to be saying that those people that took an oath, and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or given comfort to enemies, violated that oath.  The oath seems less concerned with how you do your duties, and more that you don't do them to service some foreign power or rebellion, i.e. treason.  It doesn't seem to me that the oath could mean anything that is actionable other than if you had done something of this magnitude.

The ""without mental reservation ..."" part just means that you are taking oath and you *really mean it*, in the sense that you are not thinking ""yeah, right"" in the back of your mind and the second the oath is over you are going to go back on your word.  This is similar to the citizenship oath:

&gt;""I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.""

&gt;Huddled for a lengthy meeting with his legal advisers, Trump was warned the pardons he once hoped to bestow upon his family and even himself would place him in a legally perilous position, convey the appearance of guilt and potentially make him more vulnerable to reprisals.

&gt;So, too, was Trump warned that pardons for Republican lawmakers who had sought them for their role in the Capitol insurrection would anger the very Senate Republicans who will determine his fate in an upcoming impeachment trial.

&gt;White House counsel Pat Cipollone and another attorney who represented Trump in his first impeachment trial, Eric Herschmann, offered the grave warnings as Trump, his daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner listened. Other lawyers joined by telephone. They all told Trump he should not pardon himself, his family or any GOP lawmakers in a prospective manner unless he was prepared to list specific crimes.

What sort of extra vulnerability are they talking about? I know federal pardons do not cover state level acts (and that NY, for instance, has amended their laws to allow them to charge federally pardoned individuals if those crimes violated NY state law), but I'm really wondering what sort of scenarios or issues they laid out sufficient to stay Trump's hand.

I just had two questions that I was hoping someone could clarify since IANAL.

1. I understand the contestants submitted their evidence in a sealed file presented to the judge, is this how these types of cases usually operate? Furthermore was there anything preventing them from releasing this evidence to the media after the case was dismissed? 
Just seems to me based on the hearing that this lawyer was involved in a few weeks later that he would want his smoking gun shown to the public. (He didnt present his evidence at that meeting either, just the conclusion that the evidence brought him to.

2. Page 13 goes over the defendants evidence and for each witness it states the testimony is credible due to XXs experience, lack of bias, and knowledge of the subject...
My question is what goes into the courts determing of a lack of bias? Doesnt being called as a witness for the defense in it self imply a possible bias? Could the contestant ask them who they voted for and if the answer is Biden wouldnt that imply a possible bias?

During the speech preceding the Capitol invasion, Giuliani said, *""send it back to the legislators, give them five to 10 days to finally finish the work""* and later *""we need two days to establish that"".*   

While Congress was in recess after the invasion, Giuliani tried to call Senator Tuberville but mistakenly called Senator Lee and left the following voicemail:

&gt;*Senator Tuberville? Or I should say Coach Tuberville. This is  Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer. I'm calling you because I want to  discuss with you how they're trying to rush this hearing and how we  need you, our Republican friends, to try to just slow it down so we can  get these legislatures to get more information to you. And I know  they're reconvening at 8 tonight, but it &*  ***the only strategy we can  follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get  ourselves into tomorrowideally until the end of tomorrow.***   
&gt;  
&gt;*I  know McConnell is doing everything he can to rush it, which is kind of a  kick in the head because it's one thing to oppose us, it's another  thing not to give us a fair opportunity to contest it. And he wants to  try to get it down to only three states that we contest. But there are  10 states that we contest, not three. So if you could object to every  state and, along with a congressman, get a hearing for every state, I  know we would delay you a lot, but* ***it would give us the opportunity to  get the legislators who are very, very close to pulling their vote****,  particularly after what McConnell did today. It angered them, because  they have written letters asking that you guys adjourn and send them  back the questionable ones and they'll fix them up.* 

It was reported that Trump actually did get through to Tuberville while the invasion was happening and asked him to object to additional states and delay the count so they could ""send it back to the legislatures"".  Then as Congress reconvened, Trump called additional Republican Senators asking them just delay things by another day or two.

None of this makes much sense, though.  Objecting to 3, 6 or even 10 states delays the process by hours not by days.  That's where the Capitol invasion comes in, predominantly as a delay tactic.  However, assuming it succeeded in delaying the count by a day or two or even five, what was that supposed to accomplish?  At the end of the day, the GOP didn't have the votes in the House to sustain the objections even if somehow Trump managed to convince the state legislatures to send alternate slates (which I can't see how they'd have the legal ability to do that so late in the game).  What am I missing?","13_2"

- Giuliani misintepreted Wednesday for Thursday, so ""getting to the end of tomorrow"" would have gotten them to the weekend? So a few extra days on top?

- Giuliani talks a big game about ""state legislators"", but I think it was all a fantasy. There were no state legislatures who were going to do anything, and there was nothing they could do. I don't know if this is Giuliani's delusion, Trump's delusion, or Giuliani's grift. I think they've been talking to individual, crazy state legislators - maybe those conversations gave them some false confidence? Remember that Giuliani came out with some nonsense a few weeks ago about Arizona legislators on the cusp of voting to withdraw their electors or some such, but in actuality less than half of the Arizona R legislators had signed some non-binding, meaningless document while the legislature wasn't in session and even they disputed Giuliani's interpretation. Him and Navarro have been deep in some delusional conversations with state legislators as far as I can tell. Or maybe Giuliani just wanted to delay the inevitable because that gets him points with his boss. 

- Even if not particularly sensical as far as what they hoped to gain by delay beyond limited PR victory, it certainly suggests intent. Giuliani / Trump wanted to interrupt the counting of votes because they thought they would gain something from it.

It's very hard to differentiate Trump from his crazed enablers, and delusion from grift. But either way, delay would have achieved nothing.

Why? Does that change the calculus for them either way? Do you think the Dems could have brought themselves to do something so self serving / what the Rs were doing?

For Giuliani, it seems the delay itself was the goal for a PR victory of some kind, or alternatively giving enough time to some state legislature to do something about even one state again as a PR victory or to call into question the legitimacy of the whole thing.","13_2_1_1_1"

At this point, anyone who still believes there was widespread voter fraud and the election was stolen from Trump, is firmly in the ""stupid"" category, or easily misled at least.

And when the president himself is making these claims, yes it is obviously trying to incite violence in order to block the verified election results.","17_2_1_1_1_2_1_2_1_2"

Remember, the day before and during the rally itself, Trump had been pushing the newest 'Stupid Plan,' which was to say the idea that Pence could just, you know, send the electoral votes *back,* something that Pence most assuredly did *not* have the authority to do.

According to Trump, *all* Pence had to do with something he absolutely couldn't do, and 'WE WIN!' The only thing the VP needed was courage!

The people gathered at that rally had been fed a steady diet of three things from Trump

1) This latest *super patriotic* plan is going to be the thing that will totally turn the election results around!
2) If it *doesn't* turn the election results around, the country will fall to 'socialist communist Marxists' (which, at that point, is really just stringing scary words together,) and America will be destroyed.
3) That probably won't happen though, because again, *Plan Patriot is totally going to work this time.*

Every time they lost the court case, every time an election official refused to entertain their newest bout of political pressuring, Trump doubled down on those three talking points. The goalpost got moved, and Trump continued to escalate how incredibly super crucial to the country's very survival it was that he remain President. He tried to gaslight the fuck out of people with his election fraud conspiracy, claiming it was a totally proven, factually solid, inescapable truth that 'everyone knew' even as judges across multiple States made it clear that he had dick all.

All of which culminated in his scheme involving Mike Pence, and the thing about that one is there is literally *no excuse* for it. Pence, for obvious reasons of self-preservation, would have made it abundantly fucking clear that he wouldn't have been able to just ditch election law in order to make Trump the winner. 

And yet Trump pushed it to his followers anyway, reinforcing the assertion during the rally that came mere hours before the storming of the Capitol. He championed a tactic whose *own lynchpin told him couldn't be done.*

He then directed the thoroughly riled up mob he had formented to the Capitol, at which point he apparently just kind of ditched them and went back home to watch it on the news. Jesus Christ, even as the mob had gotten so clearly out of hand that Pence was being evacuated, Trump's initial input on Twitter was to castigate *Pence* for betraying him. 

His first actual Twitter push back advising the angry mob storming the Capitol 'remain' peaceful didn't materialize for another 14 minutes. The second Tweet 25 minutes after that, and when he finally released a one-minute video calling for peace, (about an hour after he had made his second tweet,) he spent half of it complaining about how the election had totally been stolen from him, *justifying the fire he was supposedly trying to put out.*

Again, others have already pointed out his use of language during the Save America rally itself was far more combative than it was conciliatory, but the entire situation *he deliberately* concocted was rife with the potential for violence. At this point the only possible defense here outside of malicious intent seems to be that Trump is just too stupid or irresponsible to see where the course he had intentionally charted was *inevitably* leading. 

In which case, frankly, he *should* be barred from office  because somebody that stupid shouldn't have that much power","17_2_1_2_1_1_1_1"

Largely these suits have been resolved on the merits or lack thereof, or (if brought by some rando) for lack of standing. 

The second category alleges improper procedures. The key, if not only, issue is legal not factual. No one is denying that Pennsylvania had absentee voting or that Wisconsin had drop boxes, the sole question is whether the law permitted those actions.

I was with you, with the exception of the assumption that you can get a Republican to work with the Democrats, til the end. Saying a President winding up his supporters and then pointing them at the capitol building, which they then storm, should be removed doesn't make Democrats look like uncompromising babies. It looks like the correct response to a President doing that.

What about what we've experienced with Trump suggests 1. that he has any consistency in effort or messaging, 2. that anything he does or says is honest, 3. that he's smart enough to know what's good for him, or 4. that there is any norm or rule that he wouldn't break or anyone or anything that he wouldn't harm in pursuit of his own self interest?

We just had the sitting executive of one branch of our government organize and orchestrate an attack on another branch of our government in an explicit attempt to hold on to power - no matter how deranged or unlikely to succeed it may have been. He used his platform as executive, his political power, and explicitly the power of his office to foster, aid, and execute this attack. He was furthermore unrepentant.

If there are not dire consequences for that, we do not function under rule of law. I do not fucking care what your political leanings are or what you think the political fallout of this is - he unequivocally must be impeached. If senators want to go on record supporting and covering up for a coup attempt, then we can deal with that when we get there. But he must be impeached - not only as punishment for his clear crimes, but to show that we are a country of laws and to send a message to future holders of the office THAT YOU CAN'T OVERTHROW THE FUCKING GOVERNMENT. And likewise, doing this provides an opportunity to ensure that he never holds office again - something that is critical for the future of American democracy.

As to your weak claims about the timing and just running out the clock - Trump still retains his platform, political power, and the power of his office. Things he used to attempt to overthrow the government just two days ago. He shouldn't have his hands on that power for a second longer. I do not want to know what a Donald Trump with absolutely nothing to lose might do in his last two weeks in office. 

So fuck your talk of ""uncompromising babies"", your argument is a marginal and nebulous argument seemingly centered in political expediency. First, this isn't about political expediency, HE MUST BE IMPEACHED - as punishment for his crimes, protection from his abuse of power in the future if ever he gains office again, and to remove him from the instruments of power he has abused (e.g., preventing him from pardoning himself or his co-conspirators). Second, I don't know why you think this damages the political positioning of the Democrats? The majority of the country supports it, their voters obviously support it, success or failure would be an electoral weapon, and the opportunity to end the Trump threat here and now is in their interests even if difficult to achieve.","27_3"

But the President committing a bunch of crimes, particularly when some of those crimes are against the state itself, it would be incompatible with Article II, Section 3. (""he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed"") 

The pardon power is the only power (I think?) the founders took from the monarchy. But the way they envisioned it used was for things like instances of clemency where someone ends up a political prisoner because national zeitgeist demands it or pardoning participants in armed rebellion that might let life go back to normal if they felt like they weren't going to die if they surrendered. ([Federalist 74](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed74.asp))

Some people disagree with this take. (I believe Posner disagrees with me) If you read just the naked text of the pardon powers with blinders on to the rest of the Constitution or history then you could arrive at a different answer. 

That said, imagine a hypothetical and remove current situations from your mind: the President of the United States decides he's over dealing with Congress. They suck and it sucks to suck. So he gets a rag tag group of supporters and tells them specifically to go to the Capitol and kill them all. They succeed in killing a few, but not all, and President Psycho kills a law maker himself on live TV. 

The coup fails though. And order is eventually restored. President Psycho Pardons himself. Will a court ever agree that the breadth of the pardon power allows such a thing? 

No. Will a court ever grant a President with a more grey set of circumstances requesting relief that would pave the way for President Psycho to get what he wants? Almost certainly not.","30_2"

I could entertain the idea if there were genuine irregularities or sufficient predicate for a fraud probe, but there isn't (as the top comment demonstrates). 

I always compare it to what happened in 2016. There were a lot of people genuinely distraught when Trump won and many people who believed that the election integrity was compromised, but even with all that he was still inaugurated. His electoral college votes were counted. He still got to be President. The investigation into the election happened in the background.

I'm not an expert or in PA and may get some details wrong but the TL;DR is:

1. Jim Brewster won an extremely close election. There was a PA supreme court case that allowed mail-in ballots that weren't properly dated by the voter, and these votes pushed him over the edge.

2. PA GOP voted to have President Pro Tempore Jake Corman run the swearing in ceremony instead of Lt. Gov John Fetterman. This was after Fetterman refused to pay attention to their motion asking for Brewster to not be sworn in (which made them very unhappy),

3. Except this was likely unconstitutional, because by PA constitution you can't just kick out the Lt. Governer except in specific circumstances.

4. Chaos ensued. I think the day ended without Brewster ever being sworn in and a bunch of people pretending Brewster wasn't a senator (note that this leaves a PA district without a state senator at all until it's sorted out, at least ceremonially)

[Here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32717.pdf) is a good primer that explains the process from the CRS.

&gt;Section 15 establishes a procedure for making and acting on objections to the counting of one or more of the electoral votes from a state or the District of Columbia. When the certificate or equivalent paper from each state or the District of Columbia is read, the President of the Senate shall call for objections, if any. Any such objection must be presented in writing and must be signed by at least one Senator and one Representative. The objection shall state clearly and concisely, and without argument, the ground thereof. During the joint session of January 6, 2001, the presiding officer intervened on several occasions to halt attempts to make speeches under the guise of offering an objection.

&gt;When an objection, properly made in writing and endorsed by at least one Senator and one Representative, is received, each house is to meet and consider it separately. The statute states, No votes or papers from any other State shall be acted upon until the objections previously made to the votes or papers from any State shall have been finally disposed of. However, in 1873, before enactment of the law now in force, the joint session agreed, without objection and for reasons of convenience, to entertain objections with regard to two or more states before the houses met separately on any of them.

&gt;The joint session does not act on any objections that are made. Instead, the joint session is suspended, the Senate withdraws from the House chamber, and each house meets separately to debate the objection and vote whether, based on the objection, to count the vote or votes in question. Both houses must vote separately to agree to the objection by simple majority. Otherwise, the objection fails and the vote or votes are counted. (3 U.S.C. §15 provides that the two Houses concurrently may reject the vote or votes.)


[...]

&gt;Section 17 lays out procedures for each house to follow when debating and voting on an objection. These procedures limit debate on the objection to not more than two hours, during which each Member may speak only once and for not more than five minutes. Then it shall be the duty of the presiding officer of each House to put the main question without further debate.","62_2"

&gt;The egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic. The congressional power to reject electors is reserved for the most extreme and unusual circumstances. These are far from it. More Americans participated in this election than ever before, and they made their choice. President Trumps lawyers made their case before scores of courts; in every instance, they failed.

This argument ignores the widely perceived reality that Congress is an overwhelmingly partisan body; the American people wisely place greater trust in the federal courts where judges serve for life. Members of Congress who would substitute their own partisan judgement for that of the courts do not enhance public trust, they imperil it.
 
&gt;Were Congress to actually reject state electors, partisans would inevitably demand the same any time their candidate had lost. Congress, not voters in the respective states, would choose our presidents.
 
&gt;Adding to this ill-conceived endeavor by some in Congress is the Presidents call for his supporters to come to the Capitol on the day when this matter is to be debated and decided. This has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse.

Even if the Joint Session date isn't explicitly stated in the constitution it's the last official act where a performative institutional speech act (declaring EC vote totals and a winner) occurs prior to the swearing in of the President-Elect.

Changes to that singular official act will be moot after it's performed, and so any legal action would need to attach to some new official act after that (and this particular lawsuit wouldn't work for those purposes, because there would be an entirely different defendant, and a new set of arguments to make.)  So... the inauguration would be the new target date.

Chief Justice John Roberts would, I believe, be a necessary defendant (and a target of an injunction) in any legal proceedings post Jan 6th, and it is too ridiculous to consider any Federal judge considering standing in that case.   Could the plaintiffs file *something?*  Sure.  Will Federal judges be rightfully offended at the idea of considering an injunction against the Chief Justice of the SCOTUS? I think very much so.

That's why I'm not even sure there will be new legal maneuvers after that date (at least ones that actually aim at relief that could change the result and declare Trump the winner) because I think that may be the step which will finally offend the sensibility of Federal judges, and they would be forced to defend the propriety of the Federal Judiciary (and the lawyers involved, as shameless as they are, would know that.)","65_2_1_2"

It is essentially telling the court that the plaintiffs have zero standing to sue Vice President Pence, and that the injunction mandating that he perform acts contrary to the text of U.S. Code Title 3 should be denied. (Standing is the most fundamental precept in law for a court.  Without standing, the court may not act.)

He attacks standing of the plaintiffs on all of the usual premises (including asserting that they have identified an inappropriate defendant, and further noted this complaint does not address those bodies which could provide standing,) and while he does point the court to the proper defendants (the Senate and House,) this response does not suggest the claim has particular merit (indeed the response casts doubt on whether there is an injury in fact, and not just a speculative potential of injury.)

If VP Pence was seriously looking to collaborate on this lawsuit, the last thing he would do is to attack plaintiffs' standing, but instead to provide a weak and convoluted defense, looking to give the court a reason to provide relief (and certainly not a response asking to outright deny injunctive relief.)

This response, in my reading, does not bolster any view that the V.P. is looking to play fast and loose with the rules on Jan 6.

I did a little digging and the poll pads must have wifi (or cellular) to do anything, for any sort of sizeable voting operation wifi makes more sense than cellular. So on the surface he lied about them not having wifi.

But no, they counted the physical paper ballots they had in custody. Why would they print off other ballots when they literally have the physical paper ballots? The ballots once processed and tabulated on election day were secured in individually marked batches for storage and later recounting. You can watch those same batches get checked out, validated, and recounted on the dozens of livestreams that watched the process. For example, they also had to re-adjudicate all of the damaged ballots they received - they didn't even do their recount based on the copied forms of the adjudicated ballots, but rather the originals.

But completely ignoring that, ""ballot images"" are just scanned copies of the ballots that go through the machine. He would have no reason to believe those were wrong either. The machine can't edit its scanned images. 

Just to get a further sense of the idiocy of this whole charade, you should know that another mentally ill grifter (Shiva Ayyadurai) from Sidney Powell's camp has been claiming the opposite (in court) - that all recounts or audits of physical ballots are flawed or subject to fraud (for some unexplainable reason) so they must instead count or otherwise release the ballot images to get to the ""truth"".","69_1_2_1"

Rasmussen called for this ""strategy"", approvingly quoting Staln to do this:

https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1343193422996393987

This would be clearly illegal, as the Electoral Count Act specifies that all certificates purporting to be electoral votes shall be opened. It would seem their idea is for Pence is to ignore the law and declare Trump the winner. 

I don't think Pence would dare to try this, as it almost certainly wouldn't work and something like this could lead to sedition charges. Any thoughts on what would happen if a VP did try to go rogue?

Say Pence is reading the electoral votes and came to Arizona, the first alphabetically of the so called ""Disputed States"". Pence declares that no valid electoral votes have been received, and attempt to proceed to Arkansas. A congressman and senator object (likely several), Pence rules the objection out of order as there is no legal mechanism to force him to count votes, and attempts to use position chairing the meeting to count a Trump victory. 

Would this lead to:

-The House Seargant-At-Arms removing Pence from the House so that the Senate Pro Tem could count the electoral votes?

-The Supreme Court being asked to rule that Pence's action was illegal and that Biden is president for having gotten the most electoral votes?

-Biden declaring that he still won the election, that Pence's actions were illegal, and then he will proceed to take the oath of office Jan. 20 and order the secret service/military to remove Trump?

I'm thinking all of that potential chaos is a reason this won't happen. The right-wingers who advocate for a dictatorial move like Trump ignoring electoral votes haven't through would what happen next if they actually tried it.

This is the suit brought by the two legislators (to be clear, not the legislature). Today in oral arguments they brought up some other statute during the case which they think grants them these powers and grants the court the jurisdiction to compel compliance with their subpoenas. The Judge dismissed this case and granted leave for them to file an amended complaint with that argument. 

The case on the part of the Maricopa Board of Supervisors looking to quash the subpoenas as unconstitutional is still pending. 

**The underlying facts of this whole thing are pretty shocking**. The Arizona judiciary committee (+ some random hard right legislator not on the committee) held a hearing where all of these Maricopa officials voluntarily came and explained in great detail why all of the voter fraud conspiracies were idiotic. These two legislators - Fann and Farnsworth - said ""fuck it"", that doesn't demonstrate enough obeisance to their dear leader, Donald. And then decided to - in their personal capacity as legislators - issue incredible, sweeping subpoenas demanding that the Maricopa Board of Supervisors produce ballot images of every single secret ballot they received (ballots secret under the law) and their voting machines + every single adjacent component and piece of information (including logins, passwords etc.) to these two *legislators* for ""forensic audit"". 

For their part, the Maricopa BoS has explained that they can't hand over secret ballots by law, and that even if these legislators had the power to order a forensic audit, the BoS was willing to do one voluntarily, but cannot right now as the machines are subject to active litigation.

The state legislature has no subpoena power beyond compelling witness testimony under Arizona law. Also, Fann/Farnsworth didn't take a vote of the senate judiciary committee, they didn't vote on a resolution in the committee much less the senate as they're supposed to, they didn't follow their own senate rules to pass the issue to a vote to hold these Maricopa officials in contempt, and the senate isn't even in session so none of this is possible. They're acting in their personal capacities as *legislators*. Under their theory, any legislator with the appropriate position (including committee head) could issue subpoenas in their personal capacity with essentially unlimited scope and power. It's an unbelievable extension / abuse of power.","83_1"

Strict scrutiny requires that the challenged action serves (1) a compelling governmental interest and (2) is so narrowly tailored so as to constitute the least restrictive means for achieving said interest.

While the educational benefits of diversity might be a compelling governmental interest, the national defense benefits of a diverse armed forces is a stronger one.

Second, I can see how the argument that affirmative action is truly the least restrictive means for diversifying the student body of military academies is stronger than for regular universities. There are only 5 military academies in the US. A practice that only applies to 5 schools with specialized national defense purposes seems more ""narrowly tailored"" than a practice affecting every university in the land.

Then, the next time they take up the issue, conservative justices will gloss over all the stuff except for the conservative parts, and act like they are bound by precedent. 

Roberts is a master of using this technique to push the law to the right, while winning praise for being a reasonable moderate. But maybe the best example is how a conservative SCOTUS managed to exclude poverty from being a protected class under the 14th, without ever evaluating whether poor people deserve equal protection under the law. 

The first case that explicitly rejects poverty as a protected class is Harris V McRae, which says,  ""this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification."" But if you follow the citations, they point to:

- James v. Valtierra, in which the 4-justice *dissent* argues that poor people deserve the same protection under the law as everyone else, but the actual majority opinion is completely silent on that topic, and;

- Maher vs Roe (the first step of the two-step) which says, ""this Court has never held that financial need alone identifies a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis.'' And cites San Antonio School District v Rodriguez when it flatly states that ""Financial need alone does not identify a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis. **See San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez**"".

Okay, so let's look at San Antonio School District (SASD) versus Rodriguez (this shit is exhausting)...

- In SASD v Rodriguez, this *was* a case claiming that Texas's system for funding schools was discriminatory against poor people, so this would be exactly where we would expect to find the reasoning that says poor people are not protected by the Equal Protection Clause. But instead, the conservative majority opinion again dodges the substance of that question, and instead ruled basically on technicalities, that heightened scrutiny does not apply, because equal access to Education is not a fundamental right, therefore only rational basis applies (if this seems at odds with Brown v Board and other rulings, well...yeah, it's bullshit). The opinion essentially dodges whether poverty *would* or *should* be covered under equal protection, and makes some vague noises that ""poor"" people would be really hard to define, and that the Texas system sort of discriminates about funding in ways that are haphazard relative to individual poverty, so they don't really need to get into that question.

So yeah, the claim in Harris v McRae that """"this Court has held repeatedly that poverty, standing alone, is not a suspect classification"" is basically a lie. But it's also now black-letter law. A more honest way to phrase it would have been ""this Court has gone through so many contortions to avoid directly answering whether poor people are entitled to equal protection under the law, that it's time to just let it go, and say they are not."" But of course, that would require conservative justices to be honest. 

And this is how conservatives dodge admitting to what they actually believe. Because it's kind of impossible to make an honest and coherent argument that poor people don't actually deserve equal protection under the law. But if we say the poor people *do* deserve the same treatment by the state as anyone else, that could massively upend a whole ton of privileges and norms that people like SCOTUS justices and their powerful and affluent friends really like. Like, they might have to pay way more taxes, or find that their neighborhoods get way less preferential spending on things like infrastructure and education, or they might find drastic changes to zoning laws that protect their towns from the kind of housing that poor people tend to live in, etc. Laws that discriminate against poor people are simultaneously indefensible, and also really important to the status-quo social order that people like judges very much want to preserve. 

They basically need a way to draw the line, like ""just no. We gave nominally equal rights to blacks and jews and women and the handicapped, but no--giving equal protection to poor people is just going way too far.""

And Roberts is a gold-medalist at this kind of stuff. I'm too burnt out to dig up good cites right now, but maybe I will try later. His most blatant one was maybe striking down the Muslim ban, while basically including instructions on how to re-submit it a few weeks later, except with Venezuela and North Korea added to the list, so now it's okay. Another classic (that we have yet to see the punchline for) was joining the liberals in Bostock v Clayton, so that he could hand the opinion to Gorsuch, who ruled that employment discrimination against gays is unconstitutional, *but* that employers might be able to seek a religious exemption (having previously established in Hobby Lobby that corporations can have protected religious beliefs). And liberal commentators were praising that as a huge bipartisan win for civil rights, not seeing how what it's really doing is laying the groundwork for employers to use religious beliefs as a carve-out to anti-discrimination law, which is what conservatives have wanted for decades. It's creating a right, for the purposes of incrementally hollowing that same right and others, in subsequent decisions. 

It's infuriating and exhausting, precisely because of the way they use this relentless formalistic incrementalism to chip away at voting rights, civil liberties, all of it. It's a years-long project for conservative judges to use opinions that seem moderate or even liberal, to signal to FedSoc types how to bring the next case, that will get the conservative outcome they want, but even stronger, because it seem bound by this bullshit precedent they are laying the groundwork for in the footnotes and parenthetical remarks and so on.","2_1_1_1_1"

Roberts has figured out that, if you want to, for example, prevent women and blacks from voting too much (because how else are republicans ever going to win elections again?), then you need to lay a complicated framework of technical-sounding formalist precedents that sort of gradually funnel the law and the constitution into meaning something other than what it says.

Scalia could get away with just making shit up, because he was working in a time when the popular and political norms were closer to his worldview. So he could just proclaim that a well established tradition of police discretion in matters of law enforcement overrules the constitution, federal legislation, and even a fucking explicit court order with the relevant portion written in all caps instructing police to stop this guy from murdering his children, while the mother is begging them, in the police station, to stop him from murdering those specific children and telling them where he was murdering them, and the police instead went on dinner break. (Later the guy drove to the police station with the dead bodies of the children and the police killed him in a shootout).

Scalia could get away with just making up standards like well established tradition as the supreme law of the land, because he was operating in a time when people had a lot more faith in the intrinsic goodness and decency of uniformed police, etc. 

Roberts knows that his party ideology stands upon a knifes edge, and needs to find ways to gain structural control over the machinery and institutions of government while maintaining a veneer of neutrality, and he knows that he is in a race against time, but that he still has to do it two-steps-forward, one-step-back, so as not to reveal the bit.

A huge part of the problem is that the whole sort of ecosystem surrounding SCOTUS, all of the clerks, bloggers, reporters, lawyers, circuit judges, etc...they are all so invested in maintaining the godlike prestige of the institution, because they themselves are sort of part of the system. 

Like, if you're a lawyer arguing before SCOTUS, you're not going to call them out as a bunch of bullshit artists who wear freaking robes out in public to make themselves look godlike. If you're a clerk or a federal circuit judge, you're not going to torpedo your own incredibly-cushy career by pointing out that half the time, they are just making shit up. If you're a reporter on SCOTUS beat, that's like, the top of your game. It's not an assignment that you're just looking to move on from or get to the bottom of so you can go back to covering school board meetings, so you depend on access to those same clerks and lawyers and judges, and the whole sort of DC cocktail party networks. And besides, you probably really *want* to believe that you are covering very serious and important and smart things....

So SCOTUS writes the opinions in typically very formalized, dense, citation-heavy, hard-to-read style, to try to make it look like it's some kind of scientific paper or super-technical process, and for the most part, the rest of the world relies on this ecosystem of reporters and clerks and bloggers to interpret the holy scrolls handed down by the court. 

In order to see how much of it actually just bullshit, you need to not only read the opinions, but read the citations, and where those citations lead. Because that's how they make up law. They include some vague speculative throwaway line in one opinion, and then they write a subsequent opinion that references that vague speculation, and then they write another opinion asserting that the speculation is well-established precedent, and viola, it's black-letter law.","2_1_1_1_1_2_1"

In a hypothetical scenario, the black student who gets into Berkeley because of AA, with stats on the lower end of admissions, will attend Berkeley and likely be at the bottom of their class. Berkeley requires application to certain majors after a year. So they'll not be able to do something like Computer science or Engineering. While if, instead, they went to UCSD or UCLA, they'd be at the top of their class. They'd be graduating with a great GPA, they'd be getting awards and scholarships. They'd be able to do engineering or CS or Biology. When applying to graduate school (med school, PhD, Law school) they'd be applying at the top of their class.

It's all a hypothetical and would likely not work out like this on an individual basis, but I could definitely see this happening to an extent.","2_2_1_2_1"

Theres a difference between learning and considering the race of an applicant versus using it as a determining factor. 

In your hypothetical, the school would be considering race insofar as they are simply using it to call you out on lying. You would be rejected for lying. Not for being one race or another. 

Under this ruling, schools can acknowledge race and even the effects that race may have on an individual level (e.g. a personal statement about being the only [race] student at an all [other race] school.

That's only really true if racism manifests purely by lowering family income.  It ignores direct racism (eg, black kids getting lower grades or harsher discipline because of bias) and indirect non-economic effects of racism.  For instance, black kids are far more likely to live in a city, and therefore in a much more crowded and underfunded school district than a white kid at the same income level.

If the point is to lift up smart kids who have lower grades because of their economic circumstances, you're right.  If the point is to lift up smart kids who have lower grades due to the social and personal effects of racial bias, that bias does need something like AA that operates on that axis.

First, slaves were rented out so ownership isnt a determining factor. Also small farmers were the most likely to rent slaves. However, thats not the full story. Institutions rented slaves, The University of Virgina rented over 100  slaves who performed almost all of the non faculty work at the school. Every student who attended benefited from slavery. Cities also rented slaves to perform work for the city. Do you benefit from your trash being picked up, the streetlights being turned on and roads being built and maintained? 

Finally even in the north, people benefitted from slave labor because it made their products cheaper. Thats one of the reasons we associate slavery with cotton.

This addresses a pretty small fraction of my point. For example, how many whites benefitted from redlining and the related racist lending practices? How many whites have benefitted from racist hiring practices over the years (we have studies only a decade old showing very clear and substantial bias here)?

As for blind interviews, if you want to keep minorities out of opportunities, I can't think of a better policy to pursue. A lot of orchestras tried blind auditions, the result was a decrease in diversity. Not because of the inherent superiority of the Nordic race, but because White families are more likely to have the time and money to send little Susie to Cello practice. They're more likely to send their kids to schools with actual music departments. Those kids in turn are more likely to go on to study fine arts at college or conservatories. Having better opportunities translates to more better opportunities. 

You can't tell minorities to pound sand for 200+ years and then suddenly say ""It's a meritocracy now, best of luck to you all."" You're not getting rid of racism, you're just creating a permeant underclass and feeling smug about it.","20_3_1_3_1_1_2_1_1"

Some universities in the US (notably Harvard) base their admissions at least in part on the race of the applicant. For instance, because African Americans are a historically disadvantaged group, Harvard admissions would be biased in their favor to account for what was essentially not their fault. In addition, because of the high proportion of Asian immigrants coming to the US specifically for higher education for themselves or their kids, Asians are on average better candidates than other races, so a lot of the extra admissions spaces that were allocated for African Americans were taken from the Asian population. Basically, Harvard was discriminating based on race in order to make their classes more representative of the population. 

This ruling pretty much said that wasnt ok because Harvard receives federal funding and the 14th amendment to the constitution says that the gov cant go around discriminating on race, regardless of intention.","24_1"

The plaintiff in this case was an organization that represents the interests of Asian students. On account of Affirmative Action policies, Asian students were at a distinct disadvantage compared to applicants who belonged to other minority groups, particularly Black and African American students. To illustrate this, at Harvard college, the most prestigious (and one of, if not the most) exclusive undergraduate universities, Asian students in the 10th decile of academic performance were less likely to be admitted than Black students in the 4th decile. In other words, Black students who were more qualified than 40% of applicants stood a better chance of admittance than Asian students who outperformed 90% of applicants. This is all while knowing that Harvard considered an applicants race, and race alone, to be a substantive and meaningful aspect of that applicants candidacy. 

Im not familiar with how the higher education system works in Australia, but in the U.S, attending a prestigious university to the likes of Harvard and UNC is positively correlated with a higher quality of life as well as significantly greater career earnings. To many, it is life changing. Simply moving on and studying at a different school would entail diminishing your odds of achieving best outcome that the U.S. university system proclaims to provide. 

In summary, to be a Black applicant at such a prestigious university meant owning an inherent advantage, which necessarily meant that being an applicant of any other minority group meant being at a disadvantage. The Supreme Court ruled this to be unconstitutional on the basis of the Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment, which necessitates that the law be applied equally to every American, regardless of whichever minority designation they may qualify for. In other words, the pursuit of racial equity is a zero-sum game, and such equity cannot be achieved by favoring a particular minority group at the expense another.","25_1"

Re the census, I don't see any injury to listing the race, and hence no equal protection clause violation.  In the instant case, recognition of race was not the problem - the problem was conferring a benefit based on the recognition of race (and an injury to the non-admitted party).  That is, the Harvard admission scheme treated applicants differently depending on their race.

The US Census does not treat anyone differently on the basis of race.  It merely records information - information which is self-reported.

As to whether ""everything"" that uses racial classifications is unconstitutional, the answer is no.  Roberts explains in the Court's decision that there *are* instances where racial classification schemes can pass strict scrutiny. The example used is racial segregation in prisons in order to avoid race-based prison riots.  In that instance, the state goal (preventing riots in prisons) is compelling, and the means chosen (segregating prisoners by race) is the only realistic way to achieve that goal (i.e., the means are necessary).  So some types of racial classifications may survive strict scrutiny.

The important thing to remember is that in this case, the racial classifications were being used to confer a benefit - admission - upon one group while conferring an injury - non-admission - to another group. 

Note that private entities can still discriminate on the basis of race.  It will be interesting to see if Harvard gives up all federal funding in order to maintain it's affirmative action program, because it could do that.  So this case does not end racial classifications in every area of life, but it does mean that the tax payer no longer has to fund racially-discriminatory practices, even ""well-meaning"" racially-discriminatory practices.","31_1_1"

You cant keep saying we need race based admissions 50 years later after it started when these universities cannot point to any objective indicator of improvement in student education(which is one of three very limited exceptions the Court has found to policies based solely upon race...such as temporarily attempting to stop race riots at a prison) because of the policies.

It is insane the dissent as an answer to this just calls for the abandonment of strict scrutiny and surrendering that decision to ""experts."" When it comes to the race under the constitution there is no surrendering - the 14th amendment is clear.

Also - looking at systems where affirmative action is explicitly banned like California and Michigan they can achieve largely the same diverse student body using non race based criteria. It just isnt needed and reinforces negative racial stereotypes - i.e. if you are black you grew up poor.

Also - anyone who mentions the legacy admissions criteria doesnt understand how our constitution and system of government works.

As Roberts wrote 15 years ago  ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" College admissions is a zero sum game - you cannot have a ""winner"" without a ""loser"" and determining who is the winner based upon a desired racial classification is facially unconstitutional. Harvard has pretty much identical racial makeups for 10 years - there is no way to achieve this without looking exclusively to race as an important admissions criteria.","40"

The aim of this article is to review emerging research on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which suggests that negative exposures in one generation, can also be passed down to affect the health and wellbeing of future generations.**_

* *Ancestral traumas can negatively impact the wellbeing of grandchildren and great grandchildren.*

 *While most research on transgenerational epigenetic inheritance has been conducted in animals, studies in humans have shown ancestor's exposure to trauma, poor nutrition, and toxic chemicals can impact the health of descendants across several generations.*

 *A role for evidencebased trauma treatments, culturally adapted prevention and intervention programs, and enrichment opportunities is strongly indicated to reduce and prevent the impact of personal and ancestral adversities.*

 *In addressing ancestral traumas, however, true healing will require acknowledgement of the harms that were done, and broader systemic level changes.*


From that last, it is obvious that the authors have an agenda. However, if the premise of the review is correct, then the agenda is warranted:

Quite literally, the *physical* effects of 20 generations of slavery continue to have a measurable effect on the health and behavior of descendants of slaves more than 150 years after the last slave was born in the USA. This is independent of any current financial/social circumstance and upbringing of any individual whose ancestors were slaves in this country, and due to the self-reinforcing effects of transgenerational trauma, will continue to have an effect for quite a while beyond 29 June, 2023, the date of this ruling.","60"

It was clear that the conservatives on the bench did not think diversity in and of itself provides any benefit. It was very clear that to them, school was only for students to get an academic education. And the experiences and perspectives brought from a diverse student body was not highly valued.

At one point Alito made the analogy that admissions was like a race. And URM applicants were given a headstart if race is considered. And therefore, other applicants were being discriminated against. Sotomayor countered with the notion that considering diversity was giving the URM applicants a boost so that they would be starting from the same spot, not ahead of others.

Roberts quoted O'Connor's decision about race being used for admissions purposes eventually needing to go away. It seems he thinks that time has come.

I think it's pretty clear the court is going to give a decision that schools cannot consider race when determining qualifications of applicants.","1"

Fields with fewer positions to train in were dominated by the highest scores, because when you have 20000 people applying, you need a differentiating feature to immediately cut through the ""bullshit"", otherwise you'll be stuck reading things forever.

Preclearance is an extraordinary remedy justified by particular circumstances that existed in 1965 (and before).

And I know that Roberts claims that the circumstances changed in 2013 compared to 1965, but that's simply not true. Southern legislatures IMMEDIATELY started racially gerrymandering after Shelby. Again, because SCOTUS used ad hoc reasoning that was not based in fact suggests they had an agenda when they were deciding this case. It's what NEEDS to be true for them to justify their ruling. Roberts himself made a career out of opposing the VRA, he was a well known opponent of it long before he became a judge.

And I know that in theory Congress is a check on the judiciary, but in practice it is so dysfunctional that it isn't. Republicans are obviously not going to fix a problem that gives them more power.

What racial gerrymandering or race based voter suppression?

Politicians dont care what race you are, they care how you will vote. In that way, if race were used to gerrymander its just a proxy for party affiliation (which the republicans tried to use directly in NC and that got shut down.) Seeing as its clearly illegal to gerrymander off of race, politicians are going to use other data like educational attainment or income levels or population density. 

And the only thing close to race based voter suppression would be when I heard of a disproportion voting locations per capita in urban areas vs rural areas. Which if you had the same # of voting locations per capita then youd have reduced average distance to voting location in an urban area and would be suppressing the rural vote.

Also, because circumstances and potential aren't seperate immutable factors but instead mutually interact, if the point of AA was merely to normalize over circumstances, there would be little reason to care about the diversity of the student body or to expect it to reflect the makeup of the nation.

For instance, wealth is correlated with race, and poorer parents are worse at feeding their children a healthy diet (for all sorts of reasons). Early life nutrition has a significant impact on development, and so the potential of poor kids is permanently negatively affected by their circumstances. As a result, in a system that perfectly assessed potential, you would still expect the upper echelons of society to have a different racial makeup than the society as a whole due to injustice occuring at the very beginning of the pipeline.

That means that a goal for the racial makeup to reflect the general society is actually *directly incompatible* with a goal to ""not to reward or repair anything, [but] to correctly understand potential.""

But my point is, the problem is not affirmative action because affirmative action by design was for those who are not white/ those who are not given the same opportunities.

I dont see why youre referring to two laws as the same. Title VII is about employment; Title VI is about admissions at universities. But you could be referring to EEO and affirmative action, where employers recruit for diversity, which will not be impacted. Theyre all about civil rights and related because university graduates are hired more often than those without higher education. A couple of the justices pointed this out during the hearing. 

As for how the court will rule, Justice Brown will be part of the UNC decision, not Harvards, because she recused herself since she was on Harvards committee and did not want to give the perception of bias. 

So who knows how the court will rule? I am numb with zero trust at this point. If anything, there were clues that without affirmative action, things would be worse; plus, the attorneys for the Asian applicants havent proved that Asians were harmed more than other minorities regardless of one of over forty measures that they were rated lower on.

In that piece, on pages 16-18 he notes that part of the reasoning underlying the majority opinion, which allowed race-conscious admissions, is that there is social science supporting the idea that there are educational benefits that flow from an integrated learning environment. Thomas then says, well, if we are using social science to make policy about race-conscious decision making, here is *my* science:

&gt;The Court never acknowledges, however, the growing evidence that racial (and other sorts) of heterogeneity actually impairs learning among black students. See, e.g., Flowers &amp; Pascarella, Cognitive Effects of College Racial Composition on African American Students After 3 Years of College, 40 J. of College Student Development 669, 674 (1999) (concluding that black students experience superior cognitive development at Historically Black Colleges (HBCs) and that, even among blacks, a substantial diversity moderates the cognitive effects of attending an HBC);

Thomas' point is that the potential benefits flowing from an integrated educational body are not necessarily certain (in his mind at least), and therefore using social science as a part of the basis for allowing race-conscious admissions could, in the face of his preferred new studies, be used just as logically to show the benefits of racial segregation. So, if you have to provide deference to those statements about racially integrated education, you would also have to provide deference to science showing the benefits of racially segregated education. Then he calls the majority segregationist:

&gt;Contained within today's majority opinion is the seed of a new constitutional justification for a concept I thought long and rightly rejected - racial segregation.

So, in short, what he is saying is that he doesn't put much stock in the benefits of a diverse study body because **he** has logically tortured that statement until it paradoxically becomes an endorsement of racial segregation. In other words, he doesn't put much stock in it because of *his* arguments for why it would support segregation.","3_1"

The point isn't that social science points one way or another, but that if evidence showing educational benefits is sufficient to justify race-conscious decision making, then if that evidence pointed towards segregation being beneficial, it would logically also be constitutional.

Therefore, the reasoning goes, since *that* conclusion is clearly wrong (that segregation would be constitutional if only the science supported it having benefits in some context), it can't be the case, as a matter of law, that scientific justifications are sufficient to apply race-conscious decision making, no matter what those justifications are.

It doesn't really matter where the evidence actually points in this argument, because that isn't a matter of law but a matter of fact.","3_1_1"

&gt;It can't be the case that scientific justifications are sufficient to apply race-conscious decision making, no matter what those justifications are.

I think you're spot on that this is how Thomas frames it, but this line of argument just doesn't make sense to me. If an advocate could convincingly produce studies that show that the failure of the federal government to protect an integrated system of education would cause serious and lasting harm to racial minorities, that seems like the exact type of factual predicate which should be sufficient to trigger the protections of the 14th amendment. I think facts and science should play an integral role in shaping how we apply the law, at least where it is possible to measure the privileges and protections afforded by the law itself.

Moreover, this argument naturally assumes the counterfactual that was rejected in *Brown:* that systems of racial segregation don't positively cause stigmatic harm to individuals who are excluded as a result of state sanctioned segregation. So, even if you could show that there *are* educational benefits to segregation as Thomas posits, that still doesn't resolve the issue presented by the state inflicting a status-harm on individuals as a result of their race.","3_1_1_1"

His take is that racial classification itself is the original sin. Segregation is wrong from first principles because it relies on race. It doesn't matter whether some particular facts on some particular day can be offered for or against the educational effects of segregation or integration or diversity. If it uses race then it is wrong in the same way that murder is wrong.

So for him, you don't suspend the prohibition on racial classification for any reason, just like you don't suspend free speech when Nazis want to march. It sure is harmful when Nazis have rallies but we don't engage in some kind of cost-benefit analysis; we take it as axiomatic that suspending 1A is not an option. 

This is the way Thomas thinks and for him it is just self-evident.

Also, some of the proponents of race-conscious admissions do indeed make segregationist style arguments.

For example, they suggest that Blacks need Black doctors rather than doctors [of any race] who are qualified and skilled with the specific concerns of the demographic community being served and sensitive to the individualized needs and life experiences of their patients.

It is infantile thinking and the math does not work in many regions and moreover it is paternalistic. If a Black med student aspires to practice on Martha's Vineyard or in some other white enclave as a high dollar dermatologist, then so be it. It is neosegregationist to suggest that they ought to serve disadvantaged Black communities and leave all the high-dollar stuff to whites or Asian Americans.","3_1_1_1_1"

Ill argue that weve already determined that segregation is fundamentally unjust: separate cannot be equal. While some might argue that segregation results in better test scores for white students, or male students, or heterosexual students (none of which is borne out by modern science), considering only the outcome for white, male, and heterosexual students is fundamentally unsound logic. The results of the minority, female, and LGBTQ students must also be considered.

History has proven that separate systems of education fail the minority populations to a profound degree.

And so segregation is not an option (nor should it be; in an equal and equitable society any person should have the right to apply to any school they desire). Given that the races must rightly be allowed to mix, the next question is how much mixing is the most beneficial to all students in aggregate?

To that end, the science demonstrates that more diversity is more beneficial to the educations of all involved. A diversity of experience leads to a diversity of ideas which, in turn, leads to a mutual understanding between people whose paths may have otherwise never crossed.

But even if we ignore the science, it is plain to see that any society where segregation is not legal needs to take strides to ensure that end runs around that illegality through bureaucratic means do not take place. Basing enrollment purely on a test that historically favors white male test takers is not dissimilar from the voter tests of the Jim Crow days. Its a bureaucratic means to segregation in fact, if not officially in practice.

Recognizing both the inherent bias of the testing process, and the historical reasons that minorities in America are underprivileged, the colleges have endeavored to protect themselves from falling into a bureaucratic segregation trap, and we should applaud them for upholding what I believe is the very fabric of the American ideal that all people are created equal and should be given equal opportunity to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.","3_4_1_1"

Strayhorn, 2008), attending a HBCU was associated with higher occupational status in the
present study. Specifically, findings suggest that African American college graduates who have
similar educational and personal histories, who are the same with respect to age and marital
status, who share similar levels of social and cultural capital, and who attend comparable
undergraduate institutions are more likely to assume high status occupations if they attend a
historically Black college. Indeed, this is good news for HBCUs and lends powerful support to
their continuing significance (Strayhorn &amp; Hirt, 2008). As I argued in the earlier work, this
12
finding may reflect that HBCUs continue to produce the vast majority of Black professionals
and those who the Black community and society in general have acknowledged as Black
leaders

So HBCU produce doctors, lawyers, politicians but because they work as leaders in the black community, their salaries are lower because they live in lower income areas.

Like a lawyer graduating from a HBCU that decides to go live in Jackson, MS to represent underserved and discriminated tenants is obviously in a higher tier career (Law) but has a significantly lower salary because of where he works and the type of law he practices (Jackson, MS and Housing Law)

A lawyer from Harvard will go to do corporate law at a Big Law firm making 3 or 4x the Housing lawyer from Jackson, MS. Same career, significantly lower salary.","3_4_3_1_1_1_1"

The status differential is unclear to me though. It's possible the lawyer at some small firm in Jackson, MS ends up reaching partner faster (less competition) and thus is viewed as higher status than a lower ranking associate at big law who actually nets a lot more, but again, this is subjective.  

And for the greater question of whether HCBUs are good or bad, that's also highly subjective.","3_4_3_1_1_1_1_1"

Assigning people higher and lower personal score is just wrong, even if its for diversity. 

Tell me a reason why Asians should be borne to be scored lower in personal scores than other races, for no other reason than being born Asian. If universities value diversity so much, then do more outreach to disadvantaged racial groups communities. Assigning a personal score to reach racial equity is just an easy, lazy, and unjust way to achieve diversity goals.

When was the last time you heard about Harvard reaching out to Black communities in Camden or Hispanic communities in Laredo? They are starting to do some, but nowhere nearly enough, so they want the shortcut.

I am Kazakhstani. I am pretty sure Kazakh-Americans are no more advantaged than most second-generation Hispanic kids from San Diego, yet apparently I am scored less because I am Asian.

The Fourteenth Amendment, Section I states:
&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

Especially nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law - How is Affirmative Action not a law that deprives Asians like me life of being fairly treated under the law in equal to other races when it comes to education and employment? 

I honestly believe Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, and for the same reason SFFA v. Harvard should apply the same. The overturn by Dobbs v. Jackson was bullshit, but if you believe in Roe v. Wade but say that the Fourteenth Amendment doesnt apply in this case, I would personally love to hear a reason why you think people like myself should be scored lower for being born in Almaty to Kazakh/Uyghur parents.","5"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/yikx41/justice_thomas_says_he_does_not_have_a_clue_what/","TheRealRockNRolla","2022-10-31",1667250168,32,32,0,0,"To state some of the problems with this:

First and most importantly, what SFFA is trying to do is destroy the concept of affirmative action entirely. If your problem with the decades of precedent and practice comprising affirmative action is that it unfairly penalizes Asian-Americans - which is the only criticism you've raised - then surely it makes more sense to see if there's a way to *fix that problem*, rather than ripping down the entire structure and prohibiting universities from considering race at all. 

Indeed, you open your post by saying you agree with affirmative action in principle, you just disagree with the way it's being carried out. In that case, it makes *way* more sense to *fix* the way it's being carried out than to categorically prohibit it as its challengers would like to do. And if your response to this is something like, 'well it's unfixable, there's just no way to do it that will give people of every racial identity a fair system,' then your position is basically indistinguishable from opposing the basic principle of affirmative action.

Second, building on the prior point, the vast majority of the people challenging affirmative action - and their leaders and prominent voices - are not doing it because they think racial equity and diversity in higher education are crucial, and they just happen to think it's too unfair to Asian-Americans. More bluntly, they don't give a shit about Asian-Americans. They're doing it because it advantages white Americans at the expense of Black Americans. Let's call it what it is, which is part of a broader conservative project to undo the signature achievements of the Civil Rights Movement. The push to get rid of affirmative action is inseparable from the push to make it easier to effectively segregate primary education, to discriminate in employment, to suppress minorities' voting power, to keep racial undesirables out of the country, and so on, and so on, and so on. The argument that affirmative action is *actually* racist because it hurts Asian-Americans is just a convenient narrative meant to further a project conceived and executed primarily by white racists.

There's a reason [Scalia openly said that it would be better if Black people went to ""lesser schools"".](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/dec/09/supreme-court-affirmative-action-fisher-v-university-of-texas) There's a reason [vocal racist Amy Wax went on vocal racist Tucker Carlson's show to criticize affirmative action as a ""poison"" infecting all of higher education.](https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-nation/upenn-law-professor-tells-tucker-carlson-blacks-and-other-non-western-groups-harbor) One could go on and on; I'm no expert in this area and these are just the examples that come most readily to mind. The point is that it is the people most devoted to empowering racism in this country in every other context that are behind the movement to get rid of affirmative action entirely. If you're genuinely concerned about the well-being of Asian-Americans in higher education and think they are not getting a fair shake under affirmative action as it currently exists, *these fucking people* are not your allies.

Third, you seem to be saying that universities must not be concerned enough about racism because they're not doing enough ""outreach to disadvantaged racial groups' communities."" I'm with you as far as that goes - immensely wealthy, elite institutions like Harvard and UNC could certainly stand to do more to help real-world social well-being, particularly in the communities they occupy. Where you lose me is when you demand to know what they're doing in Camden or Laredo. It is weird and illogical to demand that universities not do affirmative action in an attempt to ameliorate the harms caused by racism until and unless they can... what, fix racism in some of the most heavily disadvantaged communities in the country? That would be like saying liberal churches shouldn't agree to perform gay marriages unless and until they can fix the high suicide rate of trans ~~teachers~~ teenagers. It is a completely different problem.","5_1"

More bluntly, they don't give a shit about Asian-Americans. They're doing it because it advantages white Americans at the expense of Black Americans. Let's call it what it is, which is part of a broader conservative project to undo the signature achievements of the Civil Rights Movement. The push to get rid of affirmative action is inseparable from the push to make it easier to effectively segregate primary education, to discriminate in employment, to suppress minorities' voting power, to keep racial undesirables out of the country, and so on, and so on, and so on. The argument that affirmative action is actually racist because it hurts Asian-Americans is just a convenient narrative meant to further a project conceived and executed primarily by white racists.

This garbage mindset is part of the problem. When you hand wave criticism of a policy as everyone is a racist, nobody means what they say, and they are secretly bigotted racist evil persons, you set yourself and your argument up for failure. There is no argument, no policy, and no person above reproach.

They didnt even interview a lot of those applicants. There is actually lower interview rate for Asians than Whites. How can you assign people a lower personal score that is supposed to be interview-based without even interviewing them?

Sure, Whites can challenge, but they didnt. Doesnt mean Asians cant challenge it. I dont know if Whites were discriminated, but that plays no role why Asians should NOT be discriminated.

Why did the lower court say no discrimination? Well, the whole reason that this is in the SCOTUS is because the lower court ruling is challenged to overturned, isnt it? And if it is, it means that the lower court ruling was either wrong, or the premise of the lower court ruling is wrong (probably the latter). 

You got the entire premise of the case wrong. The Asians that were discriminated arent talking about the White applicants nor the Black applicants. That is a second-degree order of a problem that Affirmative Action was suppose to resolve in principle. Which is why in the original post that I said the principle is fine. The challenge is that the current wording of Affirmative Action allows the execution of this principle VIA DISCRIMINATION of people groups BY RACE, and that should be illegal.

The fact that you started off by asking what if the Asian applicants really get lower scores in those areas is already showing that you know little about the case at all. The personal score is basically a score of how likable you are. Imagine if Asians are being replaced by Blacks here& It literally says that Blacks are less desirable and less likable by those in university admissions, and this was determined often based on applicant names (Wang, Kim, Zhang, Choi) or by their application race.
Its just that in this case, it wasnt Blacks that arent likable. Its Asians.","5_3_1"

I listened to the hearing live, and attorneys argued that the likability ratings were derived from references submitted with the applications. Aside from that, the attorneys barely mentioned the Asian students; at times, I forgot about the Asian students because, for hours, the justices and attorneys only talked about affirmative action, not about whether the Asian students were harmed. I dont see how low likability ratings are significant proof that affirmative action hurts only Asians, who are still admitted at higher rates than other minorities. 

I will not address all your rambling; the bottom line is even if Harvard and UNC discriminated against Asians, the discrimination would be worse without affirmative action because affirmative action benefits Asians, who are also minorities. 

Why do you think Harvard and UNC will make race-neutral criteria to admit more Asians if their goal is to discriminate against them?

Also, a lot of people do not understand affirmative action. Even with affirmative action, the holistic approach means that minorities must meet other criteria before considering race; race is not the only factor. So, the minorities admitted are still qualified and deserving of being accepted. 

Note: I disagree with discrimination but ending affirmative action is not the answer; the Asian applicants should have just sought relief from discrimination, not ending affirmative action, which would oppress Asians and minorities who are already oppressed.","5_3_1_1"

As I wrote in a previous comment:

Race-neutral practices or ending affirmative action does not mean discrimination will end. Most people have social media, interviews for admission to universities, names associated with race, zip codes associated with specific neighborhoods assumed to be dominated by certain races, and families' incomes could lead to discrimination. Or even excluding scores for exams like the SAT or GRE, which studies show is not an accurate measure of whether applicants would be successful in the first year at higher education institutions, could lead to discrimination. And universities could lower GPA requirements, too, and adversely impact certain races. It's so many ways discrimination can remain or worsen with race-neutral practices that hide discrimination.","19_2_1"

The case is at SCOTUS bc the lower courts also undertook the *Grutter/FisherI/FisherII* constitutional analysis of strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires the university to demonstrate with clarity that its purpose or interest is both constitutionally permissible and substantial, and that its use of the classification is necessary."" *Fisher II* 136 SCt 2198 2208 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, a university bears ""the ultimate burden of demonstrating that race-neutral alternatives...do not suffice. *Ibid*. Since strict scrutiny always imposes the ultimate burden-of-*persuasion* on the defendant, the plaintiffs' evidence didn't need to ""prove"" anything (assuming plaintiffs have an initial burden-of-*production* to begin with, &amp; they satisfy it). 

The current *Grutter* landscape may very well be 1 where plaintiffs did not adduce evidence to your or the lower courts' satisfaction. If so, plaintiffs requested that either SCOTUS overrule *Grutter* outright (ie diversity is too amorphous to be a compelling interest) OR (if *Grutter* survives) clarify that the lower courts misapplied *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. 

&gt;And yes, evidence does matter, the Supreme Court asked questions about simulations experts provided in lower courts and other matters regarding evidence.

""Evidence does 'matter,'"" but SCOTUS isn't in the business of error-correcting lower courts' math homework. You might be referring to several Justices asking about ""Simulation D,"" but SCOTUS isn't concerned w/ whether Simulation D is mathematically or scientifically sound. Instead, the constitutional question(s) before SCOTUS now is whether the lower courts correctly applied *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. Simulation D tends to show that a university-defendant opted against various race-neutral alternatives even tho those alternatives would produce entering classes about as racially diverse as race-based AA currently does (even if less diverse along other, non-constitutional dimensions (eg fewer legacies or oboe-players). If so, then arguably SCOTUS could find that the university-defendant failed to carry its *Fisher II ""*ultimate burden of demonstrating that race-neutral alternatives...do not suffice. *Ibid*.

**TL;DR** the cases aren't at SCOTUS so everyone can relitigate the ""statistical evidence"" of whether (eg) 15% or 20% is more accurate somewhere or whether Simulation B is in fact more realistic than Simulation D. Instead, SCOTUS is probing whether the lower courts correctly found that university-defendant(s) successfully carried their burden to satisfy *Fisher II* strict scrutiny. OR SCOTUS can overrule *Grutter* outright, which would by extension do away w/ the whole *Fisher* enterprise &amp; remand for the lower courts to conduct some new *SFFA v Harvard* (2023) strict scrutiny","19_3_1_1"

I know why Harvard and UNC's cases are at the Supreme Court; it was a rhetorical question because everyone knows it is not about whether the Asians were necessarily harmed but about affirmative action.

The supreme court decides whether the law applies to the facts evoking a particular law; in contrast, juries weigh facts. That is why the justice's questioning relied on what UNC and Harvard consider when reviewing applications. Grutter mandates that institutions not just consider race but also a holistic view of applicants. Grutter also requires that institutions consider other criteria before considering race. So it is undisputed in both cases that race is not the only factor that UNC and Harvard consider in admissions.

The cases are in SCOTUS to relitigate affirmative action, which is where my rhetorical question came about because all evidence shows that minorities are still disadvantaged despite affirmative action, blacks are disadvantaged the most, and whites are unaffected. And at institutions that use race-neutral criteria, whites remain unaffected. So, there is a race problem at UNC and Harvard, but it's not because of affirmative action. Therefore, I do not understand why SCOTUS is considering eliminating affirmative action to make discrimination against minorities easier.","19_3_1_1_1"

It does for them.  When are they going to admit that Jan 6 was wrong? Is anyone going to admit that it is wrong to threaten the lives of 2 Congressional representatives?

Including our representative? They wanted to take the life of our representative.  Making our congress and our representatives into living targets - what kind of legal sense does that make?

Many people do not understand affirmative action. However, affirmative action aimed to protect minorities who were equally qualified based on merits and still denied admission.

Ivy League schools are funded primarily by billions of dollars from endowments from generations of wealth from white families, and white people dominate all Ivy League schools. And with or without affirmative action, white people still dominate.

The only reason why both cases are at the supreme court is that UNC and Harvard accept federal funding, so they must abide by affirmative action, which is a federal law. Without affirmative action, they could do different things to discriminate, like getting rid of federal funding or changing merit-based admissions to where GPA or test score requirements do not matter.

I know that you think because schools like Harvard only have limited slots, it accepts minorities who are not qualified at the expense of Asians. Still, that belief is racist because all applicants are equally qualified. But the point is Asians are minorities and benefit from affirmative action because, again, affirmative action aims to ensure that universities do not deny equally qualified applicants based on race.

There is a race problem at UNC and Harvard, but it is not because of affirmative action. And there is no such thing as color-blind anything here; historically, some Jews or biracial Americans who looked white engaged in passing, where they passed for white to get better opportunities.

The numbers are not hidden. Certain races of people get in with less high test scores. Harvard has basically admitted without affirmative action - more Asians would get in but they dont admit them to make more room for other groups. 

Without affirmative action, schools couldnt use race to make decisions. They would have to decide people on other factors like gpa and test scores.

Also ridiculous to think all applicants are equally qualified. People have different strengths, different test scores, different grades, different activities, etc.

I dont think you have any idea what affirmative action does. Ending affirmative action would do what your last sentence says - get people treated based on their abilities and no their race. Race shouldnt be on applications and colleges should be banned from considering it.","42_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

The attorneys representing the Asian applicants admit that white people dominate because Harvard considers over forty measures when deciding what applicants are qualified. Those criteria include test scores, GPA, legacy admissions, children from wealthy families who donate, relatives of wealthy families, athletes, musicians, etc. So, race is not the only factor that makes applicants qualified.

So it would NOT matter if all the Asian applicants had higher test scores and GPAs than white people or other races; no matter what, they will never dominate all Ivy League schools. If anything, they had a better chance with affirmative action.

Because it is people who decide to discriminate even if they use laws to mistreat people.

For example, if we pretend that affirmative action is the problem, Harvard or any other school would not have to follow it because the Grutter case that the Supreme Court decided in 2003 mandates that all applicants are qualified holistically, not by just race. 

Without affirmative action, Ivy League schools that want to discriminate will have more accessible ways to discriminate with race-neutral criteria to hide behind discrimination because it will be up to the same schools that decide what criteria applicants must meet.","42_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

The Constitution is certainly very vague in a lot of area, but that was intentional. There are at least a couple of very valid and beneficial reasons for this I can think of off the top of my head, and I'm sure others could come up with more.

The first is practical. Imagine with as divisive as current politics are that we had to create an entirely new constitution from scratch and get 2/3 of the states to agree to it. How hard would it be to come up with a list of supreme laws that no other laws could contradict that that many states would agree to. That challenge was just as strong in 1787, and potentially even more so, than it is now. So from a practical perspective, keeping the language of the Constitution vague makes it more likely to get passed because people with different ideas can see their interpretation fitting under the language used. Yes, it means that you're going to have to argue and debate the meaning later, but it gives a starting point and gets something that can be agreed on.

The second is that the more definitely you list out the specifics, the more strongly you exclude whatever it is that you don't list. It's impossible to include every conceivable situation. So you can either keep things broad and hope that people use their judgment later to deal with situations as they arise, or you can list out specifics and, inevitably, create loopholes where you are powerless to do anything.

For Supreme Court Justices, it's not that Congress couldn't remove justices. The only thing the Constitution says (that I can think of off the top of my head) is ""in good behavior"" but what does that mean? There's a good argument that the bar for removing a justice isn't as high as the bar for removing the President, which includes a couple of specific cases plus high crimes and misdemeanors, because if it was the same bar then why wasn't the same language used? But it would be up to Congress to decide what that bar was and if they wanted to do something about it, and as divisive and partisan as we are that's clearly unlikely.","1_1_3_1"

I've quoted in other threads from Reinhardt's opinion declining to recuse himself when he sat on the panel considering California's Prop 8, which purported to ban same-sex marriage by amending the California constitution. (A decision which, by the way, was generally championed by liberal commentators, some of whom are now demanding Thomas' recusal).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The chief basis for the recusal motion appears to be my wifes beliefs, as expressed in her public statements and actions, both individually and in her capacity as Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California (ACLU/SC). She has held that position for 38 years, during 20 of which we have been married . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;My wifes views, public or private, as to any issues that may come before this court, constitutional or otherwise, are of no consequence. She is a strong, independent woman who has long fought for the principle, among others, that women should be evaluated on their own merits and not judged in any way by the deeds or position in life of their husbands (and vice versa). I share that view and, in my opinion, it reflects the status of the law generally, as well as the law of recusal, regardless of whether the spouse or the judge is the male or the female . . .  
&gt;  
&gt;Proponents contention that I should recuse myself due to my wifes opinions is based upon an outmoded conception of the relationship between spouses. When I joined this court in 1980 (well before my wife and I were married), the ethics rules promulgated by the Judicial Conference stated that judges should ensure that their wives not participate in politics. I wrote the ethics committee and suggested that this advice did not reflect the realities of modern marriagethat even if it were desirable for judges to control their wives, I did not know many judges who could actually do so (I further suggested that the Committee would do better to say spouses than wives, as by then we had as members of our court Judge Mary Schroeder, Judge Betty Fletcher, and Judge Dorothy Nelson). The committee thanked me for my letter and sometime later changed the rule. That time has passed, and rightly so. In 2011, my wife and I share many fundamental interests by virtue of our marriage, but her views regarding issues of public significance are her own, and cannot be imputed to me, no matter how prominently she expresses them. It is her view, and I agree, that she has the right to perform her professional duties without regard to whatever my views may be, and that I should do the same without regard to hers. Because my wife is an independent woman, I cannot accept Proponents position that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned under § 455(a) because of her opinions or the views of the organization she heads.

My own view is simply that whatever rule we adopt ought to apply in both liberal and conservative jurists' cases. I think Judge Reinhardt's rationale, expressed above, was generally correct in 2011, *a priori* more correct in 2022, but I can see the opposing argument.","2_1_2"

What advice would you have given in 2011 to the fictitiously created and entirely hypothetical Judge Findley, whose wife Maude is a private citizen, heads no committees, and makes no public speeches, but at home is a fiery and vocal liberal who constantly discusses and advocates for liberal causes in general, and same-sex marriage in particular, when he draws a panel assignment for Prop 8's challenge?

I didn't see anyone recuse themselves for being Christian(a choice people get to make). Why would someone recuse themselves for being LGBT or having a family member who was one(an innate part of that persons existence)?

As an appellate court SCOTUS and the underling Circuit essentially have a frozen case with everything locked in - the facts stand as they were in the district court. If there were preserved objections made in the original case in regards to standing or disputes about the validity of the some of the claims, those can be examined, but if they weren't objected to at the time, they essentially become ""real""?

Thats just an example and there are exclusions. 

When it comes to the fabricated evidence, SCOTUS is not a finder of fact and they are an appellate court so they do not try new evidence- this is the most important part to understand with the fabricated evidence. In this case, **in my opinion**, I believe defense counsel should have submitted as such to the SCOTUS, and SCOTUS *should have* waited until next term to finalize the case.

What about *Griggs v. Duke Power* and the [Civil Rights Act of 1991](https://www.eeoc.gov/civil-rights-act-1991-original-text)?  Is there a distinction because we're talking about education instead of employment?","4_1_1_1_2_1_1"

But ""acknowledge"" just means ""disparate impact"" is mentioned in the statute or caselaw as playing *some* role.

But even then, it's far from the case disparate impact alone suffices to establish a statutory violation. Eg in T7 employment cases all that disparate impact does is satisfy the plaintiff's initial burden-of-*production* of making a *prima facie* case that then triggers a maze of *McDonnell Douglas* burden-shifting ping-ponging back &amp; forth btwn plaintiff &amp; defendant. But the ultimate burden-of-*persuasion* always falls on the plaintiff, &amp; eventually the plaintiff *will* have to prove discriminatory intent. Disparate impact might've allowed the plaintiff to reach the 50-yard line (or more like the 25-yard line), but disparate impact alone w/o accompanying proof of discriminatory intent won't successfully establish a T7 violation.

*However*, even tho Harvard is covered by Title VI(6) (also a statute like T7), AFAIK T6 jurisprudence hasn't evolved into its own well-defined field the same way T7 has. And if *SFFA* is any indication, T6 is still ""coterminous"" w/ 14A's Equal Protection Clause (EPC): T6 requires no more *but also no less* than the EPC, just as T6 was coterminous w/ the EPC 50 years ago in *Bakke*

If T6 still has the same requirements as the EPC, then Yes the EPC has unambiguously required discriminatory intent to prove EPC violations; disparate impact is neither necessary nor sufficient standing alone w/o discriminatory intent, since at least *Washington v Davis* (1976); *accord Arlington Heights* (1977)","4_1_1_1_2_1_1_1"

At that point, they are just defining diversity to be whatever they want it to mean (hence I sympathize with Thomas' ""I don't know what you mean by diversity"" line).

Under the normal definition (where ethnic diversity is supposed to somehow improve educational experience which seems irrelevant to population representation), UC mirroring the population demographics of CA 18 years olds would make it *less diverse* under the classifications Berkeley uses.  You would \~3x the population of Mexican Americans (already one of the larger groups at 14.8%), slightly raise the population of African Americans (3.4% to 7%) and drop the population of many smaller groups (Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Other Asian, South Asian, Vietnamese, and both Middle Eastern and non-Hispanic European if you disaggregate those from ""white"").

I suppose we can argue on the split, but I think it's intuitively obvious that the stronger students in the state (due to high meritocratic immigration into CA from the rest of the world) are generally more ethnically diverse than the less strong students (natives or 1st/2nds from the few countries with a lower immigration bar)","1_1_1_2_1_1"

Probably wouldn't count for this reason. It's an intent issue here.

You might be able to argue legacy produces ethnically disparite impact (which you are pushing at), but that's a separate argument.  I think it's a bit hard though given that legacy are such a small minority of the applicants; it's not per se swinging the chances of an individual white applicant that much.

If you say preferred someone whose grandparents had gone to any college in the US, that'd be a clearer case of disparite impact.","4_1_1_2_1"

That country has seen some practical success using explicit quotas for OBC and SC and ST castes in politics and education, as well as with quotas for women in some local governments. 

Not that the Indian model hasnt had its issues (Cf. the rise of Hindu/Brahman quasi-nationalist party BJP).  Quotas would also be difficult to enact somewhere like the States, where there is no explicit, built-in constitutional provision for anything like OBCs.\*

But Piketty has an optimistic view of Indian quotas.  Particularly, he sees the Indian Supreme Courts constitutional permission to adjust caste-membership with an income requirement as a promising idea.  After [*Indra Sawhney*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra_Sawhney_%26_Others_v._Union_of_India), backward class members can be income-tested, and need not qualify for a quota spot if they test too high, in the creamy layer.  Piketty imagines this as a model to emulate for other countries: begin with explicit quotas, but set measurable targets for inclusion that trigger an automatic, gradual retreat from caste/race-based quotas into means-based quotas instead.

In the modern US it's a background assumption that of course breaking down race barriers is a good thing, but in India that's not so. [The prevailing attitude](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/06/29/attitudes-about-caste/) is that different castes should play nice together but are separate and should remain separate. So when you talk about a system of explicit racial reservations, Americans worry (I think reasonably) that this will tend to reify racial distinctions and make our ongoing efforts to break them down much more challenging. Do we really want a system where ""our family has traditionally mined coal in the Appalachians"" constitutes a distinct race?","13_1"

Piketty definitely worries about the problem of reifying (and calcifying) racial groups.  It is for this reason, for instance, that he seems to prefer the European census questions about parents and grandparents national origins over the American system of racial self-identification. 

His proposal is to begin with group-based quotas, as they may be the most direct way to deal with already-reified social groups.  In the case of the Indian caste system, the British reified their legal and administrative character, so there wasnt much initial danger in reifying the groups.  Given that castes had a real legal existence, it arguably made sense to begin undoing them along caste lines.  Similar arguments could be made for groups in other countries who were legally defined and then explicitly disadvantaged.  Blacks in the US, Indigenous people in Canada, Aborigines in Australia, etc. 

But as you point out, maintaining the legal categories just entrenches the grouping were ostensibly trying to eliminate.  So Piketty proposes that equality milestones be set up in advance.  As the milestones are passed, the quotas would reduce or change in pre-planned ways, turning group-based quotas into purely economic ones.","13_1_1"

And re elite admissions (e.g., HYS) we are talking about a few thousand admissions per year. So if even a relatively small number of total seats are 'reserved' for WASP legacy admissions, that would represent a substantial percentage of those seats reserved on a not-strictly-merit-based criteria where the beneficiaries are disproportionately white. (That could change years from now as the children of POC graduates come into their own legacy admissions, but that is a guess and it's just as hard to guess whether that would be a permanent change.)

It's plainly AA by a more genteel name.

Edit: Even assuming your edit is correct, I am not persuaded that population matching admissions addresses the affirmative action effect of legacy admissions. The point is that it is a non-merit-based admissions criteria with the effect of benefiting some applicants over others.

Not true, sports is perhaps one of the the most meritocratic systems in existence. Your place in it is overwhelmingly determined by your ability than other external factors. 

Legacy admission isnt based on the merits of the applicant but on the relative who is a alumni of the university.

Even in the corporate dominated music charts, where external influences such as advertisement and promotional campaigns, is still decidedly based on the merits of the individual artist. 

Even when nepotism, which legacy admission is in the academic realm, allows outsized exposure and influence. It is the market and consumers that make the ultimate decision on if someone succeeds.

Contrast that with academic institutions, getting your foot in the door is merely enough, as even a pedestrian passing GPA is enough to give the graduate access to professional opportunities not available to others that has not attended the same institution, this is also amplified when considering the impact of college fraternities and sororities.

Here, the First Amendment: (1) protects all manner of speech and acts of expressive association, whether the government considers the content sensible, misguided, or likely to cause others pain; (2) prohibits the government generally from compelling speech it prefers, whether over silence or in conjunction with other voluntary speech, except in narrow contexts; and (3) protects an individuals free speech rights whether the individual is speaking directly or through a corporate form, in a commercial context or otherwise.

Compared to other selective private institutions, Notre Dames proportion of alumni students outweighs its peers. Ivy League schools average about 11.5% of alumni children per each class, while the top-20 non-Ivy League private universities average 7.5%, Bishop said.

He attributed the high rate of legacy students at Notre Dame to the family-oriented and Catholic nature of the University.

As Justice Jackson notes multiple times in her dissent, the policies in question use race as a subset of one among many factors as part of a holistic assessment of individual applicants. The majority, and particularly Thomas's concurrence, vastly overstate the extent to which racial considerations are involved in university admissions. The majority also claims to not be overruling former cases like Bakke, Grutter, and Fisher while clearly rejecting those precedents and striking down any meaningful consideration of race in college admissions.

No it is like saying ""previous races were unfair, with some people required to carry 100lb weights. All future races must be fair.""

The pro-racism pro-affirmative action position is that ""previous races were unfair, lets ensure future races are also unfair, but make Asian-Americans carry the 100lb weights this time.

Taking off the 100lb weight halfway through and doing nothing to remedy the consequences of the first half entrenches those with the head start. The race is not suddenly fair because you removed the impediment in the second half, theyre still at an unfair disadvantage.

The idea is that in order to make the race fair you have to assist those who youve harmed until you eliminate the disadvantage, and once youve accomplished that goal, its fair to proceed without weights for anyone.

Maybe you think its more important to have no discrimination whatsoever from this or that point forward than it is to fix the consequences of prior discrimination.

But they are separate races. Otherwise its a stupid metaphor. Todays college applicants are obviously not the same people as those enslaved or who lived under Jim Crow segregation. 

&gt; than it is to fix the consequences of prior discrimination

But affirmative action does not fix the consequences of prior discrimination. Universities give the same affirmative action preferential treatment to black applicants who are recent immigrants from Africa, or elsewhere, or even the children of the ultra privileged (like Barack Obamas daughters) as they do to black applicants who are actually descended from slaves or from families harmed by Jim Crow. 

Conversely, what have Asian-Americans done to deserve being penalised? What historical injustice is being corrected by demanding they score several hundred SAT points higher on average than white applicants? 

&gt; Thats a conversation legislators can have.

That is a conversation legislators already had, and they banned racial discrimination. Hence why affirmative action is unconstitutional and illegal.

I dont have a cite but my understanding is that schools where AA is banned tried this.  It did not help balance race in college admissions because poor white and Asian families placed more emphasis on college than poor black and Hispanic families.
 
This actually makes me more inclined to support affirmative action since I dont believe it is a childs fault for being born into a family that doesnt emphasis the admissions game.  However, I still think the best thing to would be (a) open more slots.  No reason to keep student populations artificially low if there are qualified students ready and willing to go.  And/or (B) use a system that IDs situations that should have a greater or lesser weight placed on it for evaluation.  For example,  a student working full time from a one parent household that has a 2.0 GPA but scores a 1500+ on the SAT may be just as prepared as a student from prep school with a 4.0 from grade inflation and 1450 SAT score after taking it 3 times.  I think one way or another people are not comfortable using race as a criteria in any capacity.

I would also be okay if the court just came out and said schools can do this to make up for slavery/discrimination, but it would have to be coupled with other programs.  AA seems like a largely ineffective solution in and of its self to elevate defendants of slaves to higher income levels.","2_1"

As to (b), from what I've read the conservatives on the Court have addressed this exact question. Students have an opportunity to explain their circumstances (including race) in their admissions essay.

I also have to push back on your ""elevate descendants of slaves"" a bit.  You're talking about economic mobility, yet less than a third of African Americans go to college under our current AA system, compared to about 47% for whites and even higher for Asians.

Yes. For the individual applicant, AA determines *which* school a student will attend, not whether they pursue higher education at all. If, hypothetically, Harvard let in its first class of 100% African American students, those students wouldn't add to the total number of African Americans pursuing higher education nationwide, nor would the other disaffected students subtract from their total numbers.","2_1_1_1_1"

""[N]o evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans whatsoever"", the district court said. That was after four years of discovery in which all applications could be reviewed at will. And that explicitly included the ""personal rating"" that the conservative justices touted as conclusive proof of improper discrimination at oral argument.

Put differently, the people most invested in and vocal about overturning affirmative action have, since its inception, been white people. They have not suddenly cracked the code, legally speaking, or discovered some new smoking gun by making Asian-Americans the face of their challenges to affirmative action. There has been no groundbreaking development that actually justifies jettisoning decades of SCOTUS precedent - as proven and underscored by the fact that on a full factual record, the lower courts concluded that *there is no discrimination against Asian-Americans here.* What *has* changed is that when Ginsburg died and Barrett replaced her, suddenly the ideological balance shifted, and the five hard-right justices comprised a majority rather than relying on Roberts as a swing vote. That's it. That's all. Like Dobbs, like Bruen, like Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, it is purely judicial fiat: ""now we, radical conservatives, have the power to reject precedents we don't like in favor of imposing our policy preferences, so we're going to do that."" 

So yes, SFFA will probably win. But it won't be because they made a compelling case that the precedents are wrong, it won't be because they established discrimination against Asian-Americans, and it won't be because the conservatives steering this give two shits about racial diversity for Asian-Americans or anyone else. It won't be for any other reason than to own the libs. If anyone thinks that's actually a victory for racial equity because finally the unjust treatment of Asian-Americans in college admissions will be a thing of the past, they're out of their mind.","3_3"

Here's the 1st Circuit summarizing the trial court's findings

&gt;[Harvard's process does not weigh race so heavily 
that it becomes mechanical and decisive in practice [....] The Supreme Court has also approved admissions programs where race has a larger effect on a student's chances of admission than Harvard's use of race [....] The 
outcomes of Harvard's admissions process do not indicate that race is impermissibly ""'decisive.'""](http://media.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/19-2005P-01A.pdf)

Somewhere along the line people got this all confused. Two things can be true:

1.) Harvard discriminates based on race, and their admissions policy will be (and has been) evaluated based on strict scrutiny because it discriminates based on applicants' race. 

2.) Harvard's admissions policy, even though it discriminates, may still be legal under *Grutter* and *Fisher* if it withstands scrutiny by furthering the ""compelling"" interest in diversity.

The 1st Circuit was so blunt as to say even if Harvard ""considers race at virtually every step of its admission process"" then Harvard would still win under the 1st Circuit's interpretation of *Fischer*. 

The petitioners didn't lose because they couldn't prove Harvard discriminates. It's simple science that the trial court and 1st Circuit briefly mentions: 

&gt;if the personal rating is included, as done by Harvard's expert, being Asian American has a statistically insignificant effect on an applicant's chance of admission. If the personal rating is excluded, as done by SFFA's expert, it shows that being Asian American has a statistically significant37 negative effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard. 

They proved what Harvard found out in the 1990 OCR Report that, as the district court acknowledged, ""found recurring characterizations of Asian American applicants that were broadly consistent with stereotypes."" 

However under our caselaw it hardly matters that some petitioners prove that a university uses race since *Fischer* says race can be used. It just doesn't matter that being Asian American has a ""statistically significant negative effect."" 

Unless someone from Harvard came onto the stand and said they hate Asians for being Asian, or race quotas, or a few other things they could continue looking for non-Asians","3_3_3_1"

Jesus, this post is blindingly dishonest. The key point is here, where you falsely conflate the fact that the trial court recognized Harvard *considers* race, as opposed to being race-blind - which as you generously concede is entirely permissible under established law on how race works in college admissions - with a finding that Harvard committed racial discrimination.  They are completely different things, and I think you know that.

SFFA lost before the district court.  After full discovery, motion practice, a fifteen-day bench trial, and mountains of expert evidence, the district court concluded that SFFA had failed to show intentional discrimination by Harvard.  Here are some choice quotes from the district court opinion, which is at 397 F.Supp.3d 126 for anyone with a Westlaw or Lexis subscription.

&gt;In the instant case, the admissions officers who testified at trial uniformly asserted that they do not and have not directly considered race in assigning ratings, other than the overall rating. The Court credits the admissions officers' testimony and concludes that Harvard has made clear to its admissions officers in more recent years that they should not use race in assigning the profile ratings.

&gt;In sum, comments on application files and Admissions Office correspondence do not suggest any pervasive bias against Asian Americans among Harvard's admissions officers or its admissions leadership, nor has the Court identified any individual applicant whom it can determine was discriminated against or intentionally stereotyped by an admissions officer, including by the use of the words ""standard strong."" [a term for applicants who were strong candidates, but didn't stand out given the overall strength of Harvard's applicant pool]

&gt;Professor Arcidiacono acknowledges that Asian American ALDCs are not discriminated against. See Oct. 25 Tr. 120:23-126:8. His corresponding suggestion that only non-ALDC Asian Americans face discrimination in the admissions process is inadequately supported by non-statistical evidence. Further, it does not seem likely that Harvard would discriminate against non-ALDC Asian Americans, but not discriminate against ALDC Asian American applicants or that there would be a race-related explanation for treating the two groups differently, especially given the Court's conclusion based on the testimony of Harvard's admission officers that any race-related discrimination against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants is unintentional.

&gt;Whether the personal rating variable is included [in statistical models] or not, the lower probability of admission to Harvard that appears associated with Asian American identity is slight, with an average marginal effect of Asian American racial identity on admissions probability that is well below minus one percentage point (i.e. closer to zero). The model does not demonstrate any intent by admissions officers to discriminate based on racial identity, and the implied effect is so slight that it is possible that the coefficient would be positive [i.e. that Asian-Americans received *better* results, all else equal], at least with the personal rating included, if the model was better able to account for unobserved factors.

&gt;the Court sees no evidence of discrimination in the personal ratings save for the slight numerical disparity itself. The statistical disparity is relatively minor and can be at least partially explained by a variety of factors including race-correlated inputs to the rating such as teacher and guidance counselor recommendations. Just as the Court cannot explain the variations in the academic and extracurricular ratings, it cannot definitively explain the difference in the personal ratings, but it finds that the disparity is small and reflects neither intentional discrimination against Asian American applicants nor a process that was insufficiently tailored to avoid the potential for unintended discrimination.

&gt; Even if there is an unwarranted disparity in the personal ratings, the Court is unable to identify any individual applicant whose admissions decision was affected and finds that the disparity in the personal ratings did not burden Asian American applicants significantly more than Harvard's race-conscious policies burdened white applicants. Further, there is no evidence of any discriminatory animus or conscious prejudice. To the contrary, certain statistics can be interpreted to suggest that Harvard's admissions process unintentionally favored some subsets of Asian Americans, including the ALDCs and certain other discrete demographic groups like disadvantaged Asian females. The most likely causes of these statistical findings, however, is random variation in the admissions process or omitted variable biases, not selective discrimination that favored some Asian Americans and disfavored others.

&gt;Further, throughout this trial, SFFA did not present a single admissions file that reflected any discriminatory animus, or even an application of an Asian American who it contended should have or would have been admitted absent an unfairly deflated personal rating. There thus remains the distinct possibility that a review of the available applications did not turn up a rejected Asian American applicant who was clearly more qualified than the white applicants who were admitted, or an applicant who received an obviously unjustified personal rating. This would strongly suggest that Asian American applicants were not discriminated against relative to white applicants and were therefore not unduly burdened by Harvard's admissions program.

&gt;a few identified imperfections, after years of litigating and sifting through applications and metrics, do not alone require a finding that Harvard's admissions program is not narrowly tailored.

&gt;For purposes of this case, at least for now, ensuring diversity at Harvard relies, in part, on race conscious admissions. Harvard's admission program passes constitutional muster in that it satisfies the dictates of strict scrutiny.

These are not cherry-picking. These are not taking things out of context. They are the core of the opinion. 

Whereas you, for instance, quote a passage from the First Circuit that literally says nothing more significant than Harvards experts model doesnt show any effect on Asian-Americans, SFFAs experts model does because a significant variable was excluded, and you tout it as somehow being proof that SFFA successfully established discrimination.  Despite the fact that this passage is (1) nothing more than a really boring and obvious statement to the effect that each side presented expert evidence that favored their arguments, (2) a recitation of the parties arguments rather than any kind of finding about who was right, and (3) was done immediately before explaining why the better analysis was Harvards rather than SFFAs.  

&gt;They proved what Harvard found out in the 1990 OCR Report that, as the district court acknowledged, ""found recurring characterizations of Asian American applicants that were broadly consistent with stereotypes."" 

In the previous breath from what youre quoting, the district court pointed out that ""The OCR Report reached an 'overall conclusion that Harvard did not discriminate against Asian American applicants to its undergraduate program in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act[.]'"" Yes, the OCR Report found some troubling actions.  But you cannot paper over the basic fact that it, just like the district court, ultimately concluded the exact opposite of what youre implying it did.

Ill use a simple example. If a court issues a decision saying, ""the plaintiff put forward some probative evidence suggesting that defendant may have committed fraud, but after weighing that evidence in light of the overall factual record, this Court concludes that the plaintiff failed to prove fraud,"" *you don't get to go around quoting the first half and claiming the district court actually found proof that fraud occurred.*

The SFFA lost comprehensively at the district court level, on every count. The best that can be said is that their expert made a good effort of it. The First Circuit confirmed that loss at the circuit level.  Your attempt to claim that *actually* the SFFA proved Harvard discriminated, but lost anyway because our precedents don't care about anti-Asian discrimination or something, is a complete lie. Do better.","3_3_3_1_1"

Which is true, but the question was whether there was any discrimination at Harvard. In the screed I responded to, they at one point go as far to say

&gt;And that explicitly included the ""personal rating"" that the conservative justices touted as conclusive proof of improper discrimination at oral argument.

And that's... Just not true. The plaintiffs' model that the trial court credits does make a huge difference. I quoted it. [All it does it yank the personal score, which the trial court also credits.](https://i.redd.it/nbe5raxpwcx91.png)

But it's never going to be enough under *Grutter*. Plaintiffs need ""animus,"" or what the trial court sometimes calls ""intentional"" discrimination. 

Harvard *the institution* did not intend to discriminate against Asian Americans, it ""intended"" to create a diverse environment.

However, there was the unintended effect of creating the tools that allowed people to deliberately ding Asian Americans on the basis of race. In other words, discrimination. The type of classic discrimination that companies face all the time under provisions of the Civil Rights Act

Done, Harvard ""the process"" discriminated and there's the proof. The Court has no explanation and it's obvious why. 

The Court didn't have to explain Harvard's failing under *Fisher.* It could simply credit that the personal ratings were racially biased against Asian Americans \~and\~ that there wasn't animus in the outcome of a ""diverse"" student body.

In other words, to Harvard there's two types of discrimination.

1.) Discrimination against applicants, which is probably fine. It's essentially irrelevant because of the second type;

2.) Discrimination to ""Outcome."" 

So Harvard can (and has) made a process that discriminates against Asian Americans and is racist et al. But there's still this gap that applicants have to prove that the ""outcome"" is actually discriminatory. The applicants can't prove the outcome is discriminatory because the outcome is diversity within Harvard

So the applicants can shout until they're blue in the face about substantial discrimination, but if *Fischer* says the goal of diversity is so compelling it can overcome strict scrutiny then... As far as Harvard is concerned, it just sucks to be Asian American at Harvard

The remaining issue is whether Harvards admissions program unduly burdens Asian American applicants. Based on Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating included, there is not a statistically significant difference between the chances of admission for similarly situated Asian American and white applicants. Under this rubric, the lack of a statistically significant penalty against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants suggests that the burden Harvards race-conscious admissions policy places on Asian American applicants is not undue. However, Professor Arcidiaconos analysis, and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating excluded, imply that Asian American applicants are disadvantaged relative to white applicants. The questions in the context of this case then become: why do Asian American applicants score lower on the personal rating, does it unfairly affect their chances of admission, and if so, is this an undue burden on them when measured against Harvards compelling interest in diversity?

The Court *cannot explain* the difference without resorting to references to ""unintentional"" discrimination. 

That's the money shot. Case closed. Harvard discriminates. However, the Court needed more from applicants. It's not enough Harvard discriminated. As in, the actions to discriminate were intentional and the discrimination was conscious and systematic, but that wasn't the goal. 

Harvard made a process to get to ""outcome"" diversity. The intentional goal was outcome diversity. The unintentional result was discrimination against Asian American applicants. 

But on the question of, ""can we explain Asian Americans personal score without racism?"" The answer is, as the trial court explains, no.

I'll be the first to admit the lower courts aren't free from bias. There's plenty of evidence of that. But when I see Neomi Rao's or James Ho's or Lynn Hughes' name on a politicized decision, I can safely assume their bias played a negative role because of their established records.

Or that the circuit court judges were unable to perform their role of testing the lower court's findings on appeal? 

It *seems* like you don't have any such evidence, you're coming to this case with a firm belief that affirmative action racially discriminates against Asian-Americans, and so you're willing to dismiss the well-developed factual records and (affirmed) judicial factfinding based on nothing more than vibes - ""eh, sometimes courts are biased and don't really *have* to follow what the evidence says, so I'm going to dismiss their conclusions out of hand and keep believing what I want to believe.""

To put it mildly, these are not a bunch of resumes that enable an argument that these judges are clearly just covering for the elitist ivory-tower institutions they graduated from.

The remaining issue is whether Harvards admissions program unduly burdens Asian American applicants. Based on Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating included, there is not a statistically significant difference between the chances of admission for similarly situated Asian American and white applicants. Under this rubric, the lack of a statistically significant penalty against Asian American applicants relative to white applicants suggests that the burden Harvards race-conscious admissions policy places on Asian American applicants is not undue. However, Professor Arcidiaconos analysis, and the Courts preferred model with the personal rating excluded, imply that Asian American applicants are disadvantaged relative to white applicants. The questions in the context of this case then become: why do Asian American applicants score lower on the personal rating, does it unfairly affect their chances of admission, and if so, is this an undue burden on them when measured against Harvards compelling interest in diversity?
It is possible that the self-selected group of Asian Americans that applied to Harvard during the years included in the data set used in this case did not possess the personal qualities that Harvard is looking for at the same rate as white applicants, just as it is possible that the self- selected white applicants tend to have somewhat weaker academic qualifications than Asian
American applicants. In other words, assuming Asian American and white applicants have the same academic and extracurricular potential and the same quality of personal attributes as demographic groups, it could be that asymmetric portions of each of these groups apply to Harvard. This would explain why Asian American applicants to Harvard did better than white applicants on the academic and extracurricular ratings and why white applicants to Harvard did better on the personal rating despite the likelihood that Asian Americans are not inherently more intelligent and white applicants are not inherently more personable. This scenario has little evidentiary support, but it, like Professor Cards model and the Courts preferred model including the personal ratings, would result in a finding of no undue burden and a narrowly tailored process that satisfied strict scrutiny.59
Alternatively, it may be that there is overt discrimination or implicit bias at work to the disadvantage of Asian American applicants. To begin at the end, the Court sees no evidence of discrimination in the personal ratings save for the slight numerical disparity itself. The statistical disparity is relatively minor and can be at least partially explained by a variety of factors including race-correlated inputs to the rating such as teacher and guidance counselor recommendations. Just as the Court cannot explain the variations in the academic and extracurricular ratings, it cannot definitively explain the difference in the personal ratings, but it
finds that the disparity is small and reflects neither intentional discrimination against Asian American applicants nor a process that was insufficiently tailored to avoid the potential for unintended discrimination.
Even if there is an unwarranted disparity in the personal ratings, the Court is unable to identify any individual applicant whose admissions decision was affected and finds that the disparity in the personal ratings did not burden Asian American applicants significantly more than Harvards race-conscious policies burdened white applicants. Further, there is no evidence of any discriminatory animus or conscious prejudice. To the contrary, certain statistics can be interpreted to suggest that Harvards admissions process unintentionally favored some subsets of Asian Americans, including the ALDCs and certain other discrete demographic groups like disadvantaged Asian females. The most likely causes of these statistical findings, however, is random variation in the admissions process or omitted variable biases, not selective discrimination that favored some Asian Americans and disfavored others.

Footnote on that:

There may be little evidentiary support for this hypothesis because it was not in the interest of either party to develop this scenario. SFFA was wedded to the idea that the Asian American applicants were superior in two profiles and discriminated against on a third, while Harvard was unwilling to overtly argue that Asian American applicants were actually weaker in personal criteria, notwithstanding their stronger average academic performance and Harvards acknowledgment that Asian American applicants tend to be stronger in their extracurricular pursuits. The Court does not think, however, that demonstrable, disproportionate strength of a racial group in one area necessarily implies that the same racial group should be strong in all areas. If one assumes that raw talent and race are unrelated, it would be unsurprising to find that applicants that excel in one area, tend to be somewhat weaker in other areas.

And from the appeal:

Footnote 38:
SFFA implies throughout its brief that to see a negative correlation between Harvard's personal rating and Asian American ethnicity and not attribute it to racial bias is to conclude that ""maybe the stereotypes about Asian Americans are true."" This is a false dichotomy. SFFA ignores the possibility that factors external to Harvard's admissions process but correlated with race could account for the racial disparity in personal ratings.
Racial differences in Harvard's other ratings help illustrate SFFA's logical error. For example, Asian Americans do better than any other racial group on Harvard's academic rating. No one looks at this correlation and concludes that there are only two possibilities: either Asian American students are smarter than everyone else or Harvard thinks they are and assigns them higher ratings accordingly. Instead, it is more likely that factors external to Harvard's admissions process but correlated with race account for Asian American's higher academic ratings. For this reason, everyone agreed that Harvard's academic rating should remain in the logistic regression model even though Professor Arcidiacono showed that -- even when controlling for obvious variables like grades and test scores and other factors like demographics, parental education, geographic region, and characteristics of applicants' high schools -- there is a positive correlation between Asian American identity and Harvard's academic rating. Indeed, when asked what could account for the statistical relationship between the academic rating and race even when controlling for other factors, Professor Arcidiacono replied: ""We don't think it's because of race. We think it's because of these unobservable factors.""

Eg, you write ""\[t\]here was no discrimination against Asians found in the lower courts."" The 1st Cir. opinion you linked actually describes the trial court's decision as follows:

&gt;The model including the personal rating showed that Asian American identity has no statistically significant effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard. The model excluding the personal rating showed that Asian American identity had a slightly negative effect on an applicant's chance of admission to Harvard.  
&gt;  
&gt;The district court found the statistical evidence ""inconclusive"" and held that it did ""not demonstrate any intent by admissions officers to discriminate based on racial identity."" \[I\]t held that there was no *intentional* discrimination.

*SFFA v. Harvard*, 980 F.3d 157, 182 (1st Cir. 2020) (emphasis added).

1. Most laypeople (even here on r|law) use ""discrimination"" in the statistical sense, &amp; on this score the D.Mass &amp; the 1st Cir. opinions both ""found the statistical evidence '*inconclusive*.'"" *Id* (emphasis added). Hence, it's simply not the case that either court found there was definitively, absolutely, no statistical discrimination whatsoever. The most it could say was that the statistical evidence was ""inconclusive"" btwn ""no statistically significant effect"" &amp; ""a slightly negative effect,"" depending on whether you include the Personal Rating.
   1. For most people, a ""slightly negative effect"" counts as ""discrimination.""
   2. In most other contexts (eg police traffic stops), there'd be much greater reluctance to read ""inconclusive"" to mean ""absolutely no discrimination"";
      1. ie to interpret ambiguity so as to award the benefit of the doubt to the alleged discriminator
2. Even if there had been some ""discrimination"" (however defined), still the courts cannot &amp; did not end their inquiry there. To trigger Title VI liability or violate Equal Protection, the discrimination must also have been ""intentional"" in the *Washington v. Davis* sense.
   1. And that's what exactly the district court &amp; 1st Cir found: no *intentional* discrimination, *not* no discrimination whatsoever.
3. The 1st Cir was obv applying an ""abuse-of-discretion"" standard-of-review, where it upholds D.Mass's findings unless ""clearly erroneous.""
4. For most observers, whether laypeople or lawyers, for or against, the ""statistical evidence"" flying back &amp; forth is too dense to analyze.
   1. Most importantly, laypeople &amp; lawyers--both for &amp; against--care far more about *not* a) whether the courts correctly weighed the statistical evidence (which indeed enjoys an abuse-of-discretion review), but instead b) whether the courts correctly applied *Grutter/Fisher* strict scrutiny (properly understood) to Harvard/UNC.
      1. Hence why it's even @ SCOTUS in the 1st place: SFFA sought cert on &amp; SCOTUS granted cert on the constitutional strict scrutiny analysis.
      2. SFFA didn't ask for SCOTUS to error-correct the 1st Cir's math homework, which I doubt SCOTUS ever would--or could--grant cert on
      3. Notably, no court below SCOTUS is entitled to any deference, whether ""abuse-of-discretion"" or otherwise, regarding how they conducted strict-scrutiny constitutional analysis.

The testimony of the admissions officers that there was no discrimination against Asian American applicants with respect to the admissions process as a whole and the personal ratings in particular was consistent, unambiguous, and convincing. Not one of them had seen or heard anything disparaging about an Asian American applicant despite the fact that decisions were made collectively and after open discussion about each applicant in the docket and full committee meetings. Similarly, there is no credible evidence that corroborates the improper
discrimination suggested by Professor Arcidiaconos statistical model

Harvard*, 980 F.3d 157, 181-82 (1st Cir. 2020); 2) the ultimate question of whether that discrimination, if any, was ""intentional"" for *Washington v. Davis* purposes.

You, on the other hand, pointed to a quotation (w/ no pincite, but w/e) on Pg#125 of your linked PDF of D.Mass's opinion about how the district court credited ""*the testimony* *of the \[defendants\]* that there was no discrimination."" 397 F. Supp. 3d 126, 203 (D. Mass. 2019) (emphasis added). If you're conflating the (naturally tendentious) ""testimony of the \[defendants\]"" w/ the district court's own factual determinations of the (pen)ultimate question(s) of whether there was 1) discrimination &amp; 2) whether the discrimination--if any--was intentional, then r|politics might really have been the more appropriate subreddit. I suppose I had assumed (mistakenly) that r|law can at least discern the difference btwn i) a district court's own factual findings on (pen)ultimate question(s) &amp; 2) a district court describing defendants' testimony that there was no discrimination as conclusive ""proof"" that there was indeed no discrimination"" as if the district court just said ""I'll take your word for it, bro.""

&gt;And SCOTUS is required to give deference to the trier of fact, although this court tends to forget that.

Insofar as ""SCOTUS is required to give deference to the trier of fact,"" that deference is limited to *findings-of-fact* (eg ""the stoplight was red""), not wholesale deference to literally anything &amp; everything in the factfinder's opinion. Importantly, a district court purporting to undertake the constitutional analysis of strict scrutiny is *not* engaged in any ""factfinding"" but is instead resolving ""questions-of-law,"" &amp; it's well-settled that appellate court(s) (eg 1st. Cir &amp; SCOTUS) owe no ""deference to the trier of fact"" on such ""questions-of-law.""","3_4_2_1_1"

The statistics and the analysis of those statistics by the experts at trial are facts.  So youre splitting hairs at best there.

And contrary to your assertion, the district courts findings as to the testimony of a witness is, again, an instance of facts.

The trial courts impression of the witnesses testimony is also something that SCOTUS is supposed to respect because the finder of fact is in the best position to evaluate it.

So yes, the fact that the witnesses who testified, credibly per the trial court, that there was no discrimination is also a fact in the record.  No conflation needed.  Witness testimony and credibility of those witnesses are facts on the record from the trial court.

I hadn't realized that you could just establish your own comments as inconvertibly ""right"" merely by asserting you're right.

Yes, you're ""right"" that appellate courts generally defer to factfinders' *findings-of-fact*, but appellate courts review factfinders ""questions-of-law"" (eg whether UNC ultimately satisfies strict scrutiny) *de novo* (ie no deference at all).

&gt;The trial courts impression of the witnesses testimony is also something that SCOTUS is supposed to respect because the finder of fact is in the best position to evaluate it.

No SCOTUS Justice--liberal or conservative--spent even a second asking about witness credibility. If SCOTUS reverses D.Mass and/or 1st Cir., I *guarantee* you it'll be on constitutional grounds rather than SCOTUS interpreting the factual record in a way contrary to D.Mass's ""factual findings.""

Ie those constitutional grounds could implicate some or all of strict scrutiny (narrow tailoring and/or diversity as a compelling interest) or an outright overruling of *Grutter.*

Which, btw, I note none of your comments have anything to do w/ constitutional concepts like ""strict scrutiny"" or ""narrow tailoring,"" even tho all the SCOTUS Justices spent 99% of yesterday's oral arguments asking about the constitutional issues but basically 0% shoring up or casting doubt on D.Mass's ""factual findings,"" which definitely does *not* encompass questions-of-law such as whether race-based AA is ""narrowly tailored.""

Theres a solid workable precedent with massive reliance and no reason for review.

The plaintiffs are staged parties being used as a cats paw to undermine affirmative action by a conservative backer that has been pushing his agenda for decades&and FINALLY has a receptive audience.

The conservatives on the court are going to legislate from the bench and turn over precedent because they feel like it.

Theres no reason to take this case from a legal perspective.  No split.  No unsettled questions.

What I have an issue with is the starting point of  saying that Harvard is engaging in discrimination against Asians because that hasnt been found by any court.  

Its been alleged by a party who has lost twice.

Having lost twice on the facts and the law, the puppet parties that are seeking an end to affirmative action are now asking a conservative court full of partisan hacks to change the rules.

Which they will, because, as per Roberts, racism is over.

Perfect is the enemy of good will be their rationale and nothing will replace affirmative action except endless litigation.

However, the real question is, minus AA would Thomas have gotten in at all regardless of how smart or capable he was? His beef seems to be that since he felt like the student body was treating him unfairly, that the system is faulty, not the students reasoning.

The 14th amendment requires equal protections under the law. It seems fairly clear that this implies a ban on racial discrimination, but defenders of affirmative action seem to argue that ""well actually the people who wrote it meant something else, and supported racial discrimination"". Personally I think originalist arguments are dubious in and of themselves, but that is different issue.

The Civil Rights Act on the other hand explicitly bans racial discrimination. Affirmative action as practiced by Harvard and UNC is - quite explicitly - racial discrimination: it involves choosing between applicants based on their skin colour, disadvantaging applicants with of ""undesirable"" race. Therefore it is illegal.

The idea that the court can somehow just ignore this because ""we really want racial quotas"" (which is what they mean by ""diversity"") is just ridiculous.

""Racial discrimination in housing, education, and many other aspects of American life persist""

- I think its a complex issue that doesnt have a clear answer. I do think theres bias going on, but I think the root of affirmative action, especially at the school level, comes from a place of good and wanting to give downtrodden groups an equal chance. This instance seems sloppily applied.

- I equate it more to racial bias in AI applications. AI isnt maliciously racist, there are pieces of data in the system and patterns that cause bias.

- I also believe Im acknowledgement that people in life have it harder than I do based on their skin color.

- I also want to research the guy who has been bankrolling this effort to overturn affirmative action. Why? Whats his motivation?

First, education is more than the classroom.  Introducing diversity - economic and racial - into the classroom, particularly in liberal arts fields, provides a different perspective (its less impactful in STEM, because there is more objectivity in those fields). Take two hypothetical prospective students who had a parent serve in Afghanistan or Iraq. The child of the supply officer who did not go out on patrols and basically was in a warehouse in another country is going to have a very different experience from the child of the private who was actively involved in combat and who witnessed losing friends in combat and taking the life of others. 

Now, translate that to a classroom discussion on the effects of what happened in Afghanistan. Both will have things to add to the conversation with the children of those who did not serve. 

Its similar for race. I can vividly recall a discussion in college (more than 30 years ago) where a friend of mine discussed the racism that he faced growing up, and how he - and his family/friends - viewed the reconstruction period. I can recall another discussion with a classmate about how the racism that she received in the south (she was from Atlanta) was different than the kind of racism she received on the west coast (where we were in school). I learned more about how racism exists in those two discussions than I could have in a number of lectures or books on the issue.

Its also similar for economics. My best friend in college (and my freshman year roommate) came far far more economically disadvantaged backgrounds than I did. I was a upper middle class suburban kid whose parents were still married. My dad ran a small business, and my mom My roommate was a rural kid whose dad was a logger, and whose mom was a social worker. They were divorced - and had an acrimonious relationship. My best friends parents married right out of high school, and neither of them had any formal education beyond high school (my friend was the second person in his family to go to college - his older sister was first). We all learned much more about life from each other than we did in class - and isn't that the purpose of an education?

Second, who is more deserving of an elite education - the person who has the way paved for them, or the person who has to pave their own way? You can use race and economic background as a shorthand for either of those. Most people who wind up in elite universities grow up in a relatively homogenous community where the previous generation also went to college, and are economically middle/upper middle/professional (Doctor, Lawyer, etc.) class. Their parents have paved the way for them, and are able to do the ""little things"" to help their academics, from being able to explain/teach issues that the child is struggling with, to being able to obtain tutoring for subjects and for test taking on the standardized tests. 

Third - for good or bad, admissions is based on what they think you will accomplish for a whole variety of reasons that have nothing to do with your test scores or GPA. GPA's are hugely inflated, and some high schools are far more inflated than others (and over time as well). Leadership in HS typically means leadership in and after college. That makes the alumni more prestigious, which raises the profile of the university, which means going forward, a higher level of applicant.","13_2_3_2"

One of the justices brought up the question of standing - i.e. she asked who was specifically harmed by the current policies of race being factored into admissions decisions.

If a lower court declared that there was no evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans, does this mean that the SFFA lawyer can not in any way mention the Asian American plaintiff or whoever is filing the lawsuit against Harvard at all?

If they're challenging the ruling and bringing it up to the Supreme Court, then are they challenging/disagreeing with the lower court's judge's finding that there was no evidence of discrimination?  

Because the lawyer mentioned repeatedly that it's a zero-sum game.  If you make a decision that weighs race as one possible factor, and Harvard admitted to a justice that in certain cases, race is the deciding factor between two candidates, then the other candidate who is not selected for admission is denied that education opportunity because that other candidate's race was not brought up and used as a factor tipping the scale in the candidate's favor.

If hypothetically in all the numerous instances that this scenario could happen - let's say 1 in 10,000 cases each year, over the course of the last 20 years, couldn't there have been at least a slim chance that one of those candidates whose race was not used to tip the scale to their benefit and result in admissions was Asian? And instead the other competing non-Asian candidate's race was factored as a plus in order to decide between the two, then does the candidate whose lost the admission spot have a sufficient argument for having standing?","17"

They may cloak their arguments in 14th Amendment justifications, but the actual result is the long desired conservative objective to weaken the Voting Rights Act and abolish affirmative action.

Non citizen based on what?  Based on their race. Certainly not their property rights, or their history. They were here centuries before us. Its the same distinction being made in 5A and Dred Scott:  

&gt; Persons of African descent cannot be and were never intended to be citizens under the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiff is without standing to file a suit. 

*Because black.*

&gt; No person&deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process. 

White and male literally goes without saying. Why? Context. Because slaves were not free, and women couldnt vote. The property being discussed included black people. The fact that due process was only intended to apply to the white slave owner is reflected in the revealing frankness of that now deprecated decision. Paraphrased: You were never intended to be a citizenyou lack standing. Same as the Indian.

Based on the fact that they saw themselves (and *still* see themselves, even after the countless crimes committed against them in the name of destroying this self-image) as sovereign nations with their own laws and rules of citizenship. One would not expect a French citizen to be counted by the German constitution, nor should they.

No, it doesn't. Even at the time, the definition of 'white' wasn't settled, with questions and controversy surrounding the status of Irish, Italian, and other immigrants from traditionally Catholic nations; To say nothing of the Founding Fathers like John Adams who were not only non-slave owners but were proud of that fact. The *only* reason abolition was not pursued at Founding was the well-founded fear of what the Southern states might do to keep their slaves; Even at the time, the founders were well-aware of their hypocrisy, and the inclusion of the amendment process is a reflection of that. Dredd Scott is a misrule *because* of the willful ignorance of this fact: that the Founders were aware of their own failures and hypocrisies.
