However, in the long term, now students may sue a school that continues racial quotas in practice.

I witnessed students cheat on exams, professors dismantle testing, plagiarism of architectural designs and a pedagogical moving of the goalpost away from designing up-to-code green-buildings towards arbitrary sculptures. That allows the school enough wiggle room to present a picture to the parents that diverse students are succeeding beyond their white male counterparts in the professional standards when in fact they are failing then same exam that has existed for decades.

By definition, that is a quota. They might not call it that officially but in practice you can simply look at the picture of the graduating class and see for yourself.

I know this may be inconvenient to others who see diversity enacted correctly at other schools, but I am telling you my lived experience, not speculation.

I don't see how your anecdote bears out that the concept of affirmative action is dependent on ""quotas"", when there's good legal reason to believe that it isn't and scant evidence that it is.

I think overrepresentation is fixable without quotas, yes- if anything, all of the arguments about ""merit"" have rung fairly hollow to me, since I'm not really sure how we're supposed to quantify that absolutely. Since I'm not inclined to accept an argument that academic merit is genetic, it's likely that overrepresentation points to the criteria being used to judge merit not actually assessing students accurately. I feel like taking that into account during admissions (which is the point of affirmative action policies!) is an important step to making assessments of merit in admissions \*more\* accurate, not less. The argument that ""standards have been lowered"" assumes a fidelity of standards that not only doesn't exist, but likely can't exist without changes to assessment policy, given the same overrepresentation that you already pointed out.  Does that mean that affirmative action necessarily assesses students more accurately? No. But it certainly makes an argument that removing the ability to take circumstances into account during assessment misunderstands the utility of those assessments, and I can't imagine that having a less clear view of a student provides more rigorous admissions. This claim keeps coming up, and I simply don't know where it comes from.

EDIT: I'm not sure why I'm getting PMed about this- I think there's good evidence that a lot of the metrics being cited here are \*predictive\*, but that's not the same thing as saying that they're \*equitable\*. Those are definitely different things.","1_3_1_1_2"

No, I am not talking about affirmative action in *theory*. I am talking about affirmative action in *practice*. That is very clear. You just moved the goalpost to ignore the core of the issue at hand: the Supreme Court struck down Affirmative Action because it enables discrimination *in practice* in order to achieve the goals of the utopian ideology.

If my case was simply an anecdote and not the very core of affirmative action *in practice* then the Supreme Court would not have struck it down. If you take a look at the Pew Research poll, 73% of Americans oppose race as a factor in college admissions  why is that? Do you honestly think that just occurred in a vacuum? 

There is a racial agenda in America to dismantle meritocracy in academia and impose racial quotas. Just because they call it something else in theory, that doesnt mean they dont impose a quota in practice. Again, for the third time, Im happy to share you *the lecture my thesis advisor* gave on this quota. Its become the official policy at my school from the dean Harriet Harris. I am not being dishonest with you, Im simply telling you what me and the entire country witnessed with our own eyes.

&gt; I think overrepresentation is fixable without quotas

Why should we fix over representation in an institution that is not representative? Academia is not a representative governing body  it is a technocratic meritocracy. The only place where overrepresentation should be questioned is in law making and law enforcement. The fact that my people are 88% of helicopter pilots 90% of architects 95% of physicists and 99% of carpenters should not necessarily be a *problem* to fix. There is not a conspiracy, and to suggest that there is an antisemitic dogwhistle. 

Affirmative action is a half baked solution to a delusional conspiracy theory rooted in racial resentment.

Essays, portfolio of art works judged by a jury of accomplished professionals, extracurricular leadership roles, awards and achievements.

That is how it has always been. But the equal opportunity has produced and unequal outcome. That does not necessarily imply a conspiracy  it implies that different demographic groups are& different, just as an apple is different from an orange is different from a banana. There are 7 forms of intelligence. While the above tests may narrow the scope to 3 or 4, the extracurricular and essay often shine light on the rest of them.

If the US will continue American primacy through the Bidenomics of building better green buildings and products, then we need the best (creative, intelligent and successful) architects, designers, engineers, technicians, pipe fitters and electricians  and nothing less.

Take my profession of architecture for example. The primary skill of an architect is called spatial reasoning as it applies to designing a building. You take a 2D bubble diagram, extrude it in your head while accounting for building codes, then rotate it in your head and draw a cross section. Then you zoom in to the wall assembly and detail the flashing, then you zoom out to the zoning map and relate the FAR to the flashing to the floor-floor height. That does not involve the Brocas area or social networking or managing people *as much as* it involves pure spatial reasoning. You can measure spatial reasoning with the IQ test, some questions on the ACT science section, a portfolio of 2D and 3D works, a list of achievements.

These are already part of the admissions and education process. But in order to achieve a diverse demographic of race and sex, we are *removing the metrics* to measure this most essential core skill of the architect from admissions and education. Students no longer have to build a physical model and applicants no longer have to submit a portfolio. We are not *adding* metrics for a bigger picture that distracts us from the core of architecture. We are literally *removing* the metrics at the very core of the profession because the outcomes of those scores are unequally achieved.","1_3_1_1_2_1"

How did you use this phrase right after claiming that I had moved the goalposts? Affirmative action, the concept struck down by this ruling, legally cannot include quotas. 

&gt;There is a racial agenda in America to dismantle meritocracy in academia and impose racial quotas

This is the more important point that I was making- there is absolutely no evidence that these sorts of ""merit"" arguments have real grounding. It seems to me like people decided that the context in which assessments were taken somehow reduces the validity of those assessments. I do not know where this argument comes from, especially since it clashes with a lot of evidence about how assessments are designed and interpreted.

&gt; it is a technocratic meritocracy.

This claim only makes sense if you know that your assessments are directly, incontrovertibly accurate. I don't think that claim bears out, and I don't think anybody who studies assessments in depth would think that it does. Accounting for variables outside the assessments themselves could reasonably \*improve\* the accuracy of this ""meritocracy"". To that point, basically all of the metrics that you cite in your list have had a lot of arguments about equity leveled at them. As a brief example, flipped classroom models regularly improve performance of underrepresented students without harming students who already performed well- if the format is capable of such significant effects, why should we assume that test grades from non-flipped classrooms are perfectly prognostic? How do we even know that the flipped classes are accurate either? And if we don't bother looking at that information, why should we assume that we collected better information?

I think a realistic reckoning with ""merit"" requires a more careful examination of what metrics are and how they're used- there's no good reason to assume that any metric is entirely prognostic, and evaluating them in context is extremely important. I don't see why decreasing the ability to analyze that context increases the rigor of the assessment, so I don't see why we should accept that eliminating affirmative action actually makes admissions reflect ""merit"" more accurately. 

Which is a long way to say that I'm very sick of these claims that affirmative action somehow opposes merit. There's no evidence of that, and good reason to believe that eliminating race-conscious analysis reduces our ability to approach these questions rationally.","1_3_1_1_2_1_1"

They do not. The ruling cites the Bakke case several times, as it rightly should. Either you're using ""quotas"" messily (and differently from the case!), or you don't understand the argument on at least one side of this.

&gt;Source? Are you suggesting their is a conspiracy of racists in pointy white hoods who invented the quadratic formula?

Absolutely not- I'm arguing that students' interactions with course material are based on their prior knowledge, and their background contributes to prior knowledge. This shouldn't be controversial- it also certainly doesn't argue that ""real meritocracy has never been tried"", but rather that painting ""meritocracy"" with a veneer of objectivity requires looking into if your metrics actually assess all students from all backgrounds equally. There's no good reason to assume that they'll do this without looking, and good evidence in the literature that these assessments can be inequitable. Flipped classrooms are a term in pedagogy research, largely referring to those that go away from ""lecture-based"" models and towards one where students are expected to co-create knowledge about concepts covered in class. As I mentioned above, historically marginalized students in this format tend to have a narrower achievement gap relative to other students, implying that the traditional lecture format \*wasn't\* objectively measuring their capacity to show proficiency in the subject. So, if the students' identity/background informed their grades as a function of the structure of the class, why would we assume that the grades in that class were agnostic to the students' identities or backgrounds? Of course, we shouldn't- it's not a claim that grades can \*never\* be objective, but rather a claim that understanding the objectivity of grades requires looking at the environment that they were generated in first. That's an identity-conscious process. Adding that analysis makes the use of grades as a factor more prognostic, not less.

Which is a long way to say that these ""empirical"" metrics aren't useless, but that we shouldn't lean into them too hard without checking that there aren't unexpected confounds in there, and that a good portion of that checking is going to have to go through student identity. Plenty of people have already done these sorts of analyses on most of these metrics, but I don't see how eliminating affirmative action makes that process more efficient, and I don't think painting empirical metrics as plainly ""objective"" is either accurate or beneficial. We know they're confounded, and we know what some of those confounds are!","1_3_1_1_2_1_1_1_1"

See now youve just moved the goalpost and tried to make an argument based in this false reality. Its not arbitrary. The foundations of this entire argument are delusional. The whole point of academia is that it is *not* arbitrary and racist, but is a meritocracy. It may not be perfect, but dont let perfection be the enemy of good and throw out the baby with the bath water.

The people who get rejected from Harvard go to other schools like Yale, Stanford, Oxford, MIT and Princeton. If they get rejected from those schools too, then they go to 2nd and 3rd tier schools like Syracuse and Pratt. That *increases* the competition of the study body at those schools. That raises the economic productivity from all colleges and is better for the economy when only smart people get into college and graduate.

But when you just assume this self-fulfilling arbitrary process, the 2nd and 3rd tier schools end up rejecting students for being too smart in favor of diversity hires. The problem with affirmative action is not so much as the Ivy League as much as it is 2nd and 3rd tier schools because that is where poor whites often go because they rely on those merit based scholarships. The downstream impact of this arbitrary process is that the economy becomes less and less competitive against China, Russia and the global south while we are focused on inflationary inclusion policies.

Again, if you care about American primacy and growing the economy to be competitive in a globalized world, we need competition.

Capitalism without competition is not capitalism.","3_1"

People are using this logic to psychologically displace their economic conditions on to others. You had it easy because you grew up without crime and I had to crawl out of the hood instead of become the captain of a non-existent chess club is the sort of sentiment.

Thats called life. The purpose of academia is not to level the playing field in terms of life. Some people are born with extra chromosomes, others with severe disabilities, others without a father present. Should we have a fatherlessness scholarship now? Studies show that men with present fathers perform better in school. 

I can tell you based on my high school experience from Walt Whitman High in Bethesda, Maryland that I balanced school and extra-curricular culture score. Did growing up down the street from NIH and away from crime contribute to that? Absolutely, my family chose this place because it had the best jazz band and best physics. Why should my family be penalized for making good choices? I was the snare captain of the drum line, the jazz band drummer, played gigs with college aged guys on the weekends, created my own club, dated the hot cheerleader and always threw parties at my house. Colleges and business want leaders who can network and ultimately make money. I focused on ONE AP course  AP Physics C mechanics  and the rest of my time went to music and tail. Thats what leaders do. Thats what predicted my success in college. I was the lead designer of the NASA grant and assumed other leadership roles that changed the world. 

All of the nerds who wasted their prime years of their life nose-deep in books instead of mini-skirts didnt become business leaders or pioneers  they ended up working for me. 

The 1st law of economics is supply and demand. Anyone can study for 8 hours, but can they arrange a group of people to accomplish a goal? Can they change the world? Thats what colleges want their reputation to reflect. AI can replace nerds& but they cant replace leaders.

That being said, as a leader, I got only one question wrong in the ACT science section. Other students who failed the ACT and basic physics were not capable of meeting the MINIMUM standards to participate in the NASA grant, but because of affirmative action, then, CEI DEI, they were forced into the grant, slowing down the progress, sometimes intentionally. AA *in theory* happens after the standards are met but because some are ideologically driven to right the wrongs of history they end up lowering the standards to meet that goal *in practice*.

So this idea that you can right the injustice of unequal upbringing is tragically delusional. Your brain develops in stages and you lose grey matter over time. If you grew up with a bad environment, college handouts wont fix that. My parents paid $100 for a tutor from Georgetown (my fathers alma mater) to teach me basic arithmetic in elementary school, and because of it, my brain developed differently than another less privileged student who grew up fatherless on the streets. That doesnt make me better or worse, that is just reality: your childhood sticks with you. The sad reality is that your personality develops at a young age and youre stuck as that person. We hand these people everything they wanted in terms of inclusion into research and grants and they blew it. I witnessed it. The student from [a controlled country] had no education in ecology or physics and they walked into the NASA grant and I had to explain the Coriolis effect to them, using just TWO lines of basic algebra to summarize decades of my education. They slowed the whole thing down, in one case, intentionally, as they admit to me later on. That is my experience with affirmative action. People who cant meet the standards everyone else has to abide by just drag us all down with them.","3_1_1_1"

I think the lesson here is balance.

High school, college, grad school, research and business favor robust candidates who engage all 7 forms of intelligence and some leadership skills. The Asian group who sued Harvard focused only on the testing merit while disregarding culture merit. The AA proponents focused only on the culture merit while disregarding testing merit. 

But this balance will not reverse 400 years of oppression in 10 years, and people need to come to terms with that reality. It will take decades to establish the black owned suburbs and businesses that allow for a true equal upbringing. Until we solve the housing crisis, which I believe is the root cause of the issue AA attempts to solve, then we are just putting a rainbow bandaid on cancer, putting CEI ally on the brochure without actually helping the community fight cancer. The reality is that it is not the role of the college to parent students  it is simply a life learning litmus test.

Now that AA was over-ruled, we can in theory select a student body where *diversity is the symptom of meritocracy* rather than an imposed ideology, wherein the metrics that measure merit are what they have always been: 

#test scores + culture scores.

But then certain schools, clinging on to the Marxist ideology of equality of outcome known as equity will re-define the culture score not to mean leadership skills but some type of response to adversity. So people like me, despite being the leader of multiple groups with multiple talents, will be penalized for our privilege scores because we had no serious adversity. When I scored the highest on my ecology for architects multiple choice exam, an exam where I was the only A letter grade and many of my peers failed, they rationalized their failure by saying that oh you took adderall and grew up in Bethesda so you had an advantage as to disregard my MONTHS of studying hard for that exam. The school removed the test  the same ecology test it had for decades  and said that testing was racist, but specifically, a white supremacist construct. They basically called me a Nazi because I studied for an ecology exam.

What the ruling does is set the stage for future lawsuits against these type of Marxists who continue to perpetuate this racist ideology through other legal avenues. Next, SCOTUS will likely go after CEI DEI agendas, arguing that the *hiring* based on race/sex is unconstitutional, using this ruling as a precedent. Then, colleges will be forced to justify their more transparent selection process or face legal scrutiny.

There will be lawsuits after lawsuits after lawsuits at these type of CEI DEI ASLGBTQ+ schools and they may be forced into bankruptcy unless they end these discriminatory practices. There will be class action lawsuits for people rejected from jobs based on quotas. Individuals will be prosecuted for fraud and promoting the type of hateful environment that led to me and my family getting multiple death threats from students.","3_1_1_1_1_1"

But here is my take on AA. I think it has run its course. Is it helping nonwhites/non-Asians anymore in meaningful way from socioeconomic perspectives anymore? I am an east Asian immigrant, and I dont see how AA has improved the livelihood of Black and Hispanic Americans in last 15 years. I do value diversity - I am in grad school, science should promote everyone regardless background - but not at the expense of sacrificing merits. And the ""empathy"" or ""personable"" parameter that Harvard used to score Asian candidates seemed contrived and targeted at them to reduce their numbers. If you have seen that race make up of the Harvard admission each year, youd quickly realize that their denial of ""hard race quota"" is a half-assed lie. What is the end goal of AA really? Is getting into a college the end goal? Or is it one of ways to improve the livelihood in a long run? 

That said, us Asian Americans need to dial back on prestige factors. I as an immigrant went to a state university for BS in chem E, and am in another state university for a PhD in food science.

As a prof, you don't really have academic supervision by anyone else. Everything is self-motivated. You create your lab, your work and research thrusts, your graduate students, your undergrads if you want them, everything. No one else tells you what to do except in administrative manners.

I have also met the 'residents who want to do research', where you have to design the entire experiment so that the resident can come in and turn on the thermocycler and thinks he did everything himself. I see my way of thinking more as a 'I don't want your pitty'-type of approach. If I would be lazy, I would just lay back and rely on the promised support.

I care for the quality of my work and I want to be innovative.

I do think affirmative action is hurting the quality of the research because the initial rules for promotions are being by-passed. In the department, there is a minimum grant (a K-award or an R01) you need to get in order to be considered for tenure track. However, some people do not have this and are still being promoted, because the department wants to have more female-PIs. They are funded by private donations, given to the head of the department, who directs it to these 'minorities'. It only angers the other researchers and I can't believe these women feel good about how they got their positions. I'm not at the point in my career that this affects me, but it contributes to feelings that academia is rigged and that you only can make it when you suck up to somebody who is in a higher position. Often, the most innovative ideas come from people who are non-agreeable and who don't agree with the scientific consensus, instead of people who suck up to the established researchers in order to be picked for a promotion.","2_1"

I don't see how your anecdote bears out that the concept of affirmative action is dependent on ""quotas"", when there's good legal reason to believe that it isn't and scant evidence that it is.

I think overrepresentation is fixable without quotas, yes- if anything, all of the arguments about ""merit"" have rung fairly hollow to me, since I'm not really sure how we're supposed to quantify that absolutely. Since I'm not inclined to accept an argument that academic merit is genetic, it's likely that overrepresentation points to the criteria being used to judge merit not actually assessing students accurately. I feel like taking that into account during admissions (which is the point of affirmative action policies!) is an important step to making assessments of merit in admissions \*more\* accurate, not less. The argument that ""standards have been lowered"" assumes a fidelity of standards that not only doesn't exist, but likely can't exist without changes to assessment policy, given the same overrepresentation that you already pointed out.  Does that mean that affirmative action necessarily assesses students more accurately? No. But it certainly makes an argument that removing the ability to take circumstances into account during assessment misunderstands the utility of those assessments, and I can't imagine that having a less clear view of a student provides more rigorous admissions. This claim keeps coming up, and I simply don't know where it comes from.

EDIT: I'm not sure why I'm getting PMed about this- I think there's good evidence that a lot of the metrics being cited here are \*predictive\*, but that's not the same thing as saying that they're \*equitable\*. Those are definitely different things.","1_3_1_1_2"

No, I am not talking about affirmative action in *theory*. I am talking about affirmative action in *practice*. That is very clear. You just moved the goalpost to ignore the core of the issue at hand: the Supreme Court struck down Affirmative Action because it enables discrimination *in practice* in order to achieve the goals of the utopian ideology.

If my case was simply an anecdote and not the very core of affirmative action *in practice* then the Supreme Court would not have struck it down. If you take a look at the Pew Research poll, 73% of Americans oppose race as a factor in college admissions  why is that? Do you honestly think that just occurred in a vacuum? 

There is a racial agenda in America to dismantle meritocracy in academia and impose racial quotas. Just because they call it something else in theory, that doesnt mean they dont impose a quota in practice. Again, for the third time, Im happy to share you *the lecture my thesis advisor* gave on this quota. Its become the official policy at my school from the dean Harriet Harris. I am not being dishonest with you, Im simply telling you what me and the entire country witnessed with our own eyes.

&gt; I think overrepresentation is fixable without quotas

Why should we fix over representation in an institution that is not representative? Academia is not a representative governing body  it is a technocratic meritocracy. The only place where overrepresentation should be questioned is in law making and law enforcement. The fact that my people are 88% of helicopter pilots 90% of architects 95% of physicists and 99% of carpenters should not necessarily be a *problem* to fix. There is not a conspiracy, and to suggest that there is an antisemitic dogwhistle. 

Affirmative action is a half baked solution to a delusional conspiracy theory rooted in racial resentment.

That is how it has always been. But the equal opportunity has produced and unequal outcome.

There are 7 forms of intelligence. While the above tests may narrow the scope to 3 or 4, the extracurricular and essay often shine light on the rest of them.

If the US will continue American primacy through the Bidenomics of building better green buildings and products, then we need the best (creative, intelligent and successful) architects, designers, engineers, technicians, pipe fitters and electricians  and nothing less.

Take my profession of architecture for example. The primary skill of an architect is called spatial reasoning as it applies to designing a building. You take a 2D bubble diagram, extrude it in your head while accounting for building codes, then rotate it in your head and draw a cross section. Then you zoom in to the wall assembly and detail the flashing, then you zoom out to the zoning map and relate the FAR to the flashing to the floor-floor height. That does not involve the Brocas area or social networking or managing people *as much as* it involves pure spatial reasoning. You can measure spatial reasoning with the IQ test, some questions on the ACT science section, a portfolio of 2D and 3D works, a list of achievements.

These are already part of the admissions and education process. But in order to achieve a diverse demographic of race and sex, we are *removing the metrics* to measure this most essential core skill of the architect from admissions and education. Students no longer have to build a physical model and applicants no longer have to submit a portfolio. We are not *adding* metrics for a bigger picture that distracts us from the core of architecture. We are literally *removing* the metrics at the very core of the profession because the outcomes of those scores are unequally achieved.","1_3_1_1_2_1"

How did you use this phrase right after claiming that I had moved the goalposts? Affirmative action, the concept struck down by this ruling, legally cannot include quotas. 

&gt;There is a racial agenda in America to dismantle meritocracy in academia and impose racial quotas

This is the more important point that I was making- there is absolutely no evidence that these sorts of ""merit"" arguments have real grounding. It seems to me like people decided that the context in which assessments were taken somehow reduces the validity of those assessments. I do not know where this argument comes from, especially since it clashes with a lot of evidence about how assessments are designed and interpreted.

&gt; it is a technocratic meritocracy.

This claim only makes sense if you know that your assessments are directly, incontrovertibly accurate. I don't think that claim bears out, and I don't think anybody who studies assessments in depth would think that it does. Accounting for variables outside the assessments themselves could reasonably \*improve\* the accuracy of this ""meritocracy"". To that point, basically all of the metrics that you cite in your list have had a lot of arguments about equity leveled at them. As a brief example, flipped classroom models regularly improve performance of underrepresented students without harming students who already performed well- if the format is capable of such significant effects, why should we assume that test grades from non-flipped classrooms are perfectly prognostic? How do we even know that the flipped classes are accurate either? And if we don't bother looking at that information, why should we assume that we collected better information?

I think a realistic reckoning with ""merit"" requires a more careful examination of what metrics are and how they're used- there's no good reason to assume that any metric is entirely prognostic, and evaluating them in context is extremely important. I don't see why decreasing the ability to analyze that context increases the rigor of the assessment, so I don't see why we should accept that eliminating affirmative action actually makes admissions reflect ""merit"" more accurately. 

Which is a long way to say that I'm very sick of these claims that affirmative action somehow opposes merit. There's no evidence of that, and good reason to believe that eliminating race-conscious analysis reduces our ability to approach these questions rationally.","1_3_1_1_2_1_1"

&gt;Source? Are you suggesting their is a conspiracy of racists in pointy white hoods who invented the quadratic formula?

Absolutely not- I'm arguing that students' interactions with course material are based on their prior knowledge, and their background contributes to prior knowledge. This shouldn't be controversial- it also certainly doesn't argue that ""real meritocracy has never been tried"", but rather that painting ""meritocracy"" with a veneer of objectivity requires looking into if your metrics actually assess all students from all backgrounds equally. There's no good reason to assume that they'll do this without looking, and good evidence in the literature that these assessments can be inequitable. Flipped classrooms are a term in pedagogy research, largely referring to those that go away from ""lecture-based"" models and towards one where students are expected to co-create knowledge about concepts covered in class. As I mentioned above, historically marginalized students in this format tend to have a narrower achievement gap relative to other students, implying that the traditional lecture format \*wasn't\* objectively measuring their capacity to show proficiency in the subject. So, if the students' identity/background informed their grades as a function of the structure of the class, why would we assume that the grades in that class were agnostic to the students' identities or backgrounds? Of course, we shouldn't- it's not a claim that grades can \*never\* be objective, but rather a claim that understanding the objectivity of grades requires looking at the environment that they were generated in first. That's an identity-conscious process. Adding that analysis makes the use of grades as a factor more prognostic, not less.

Which is a long way to say that these ""empirical"" metrics aren't useless, but that we shouldn't lean into them too hard without checking that there aren't unexpected confounds in there, and that a good portion of that checking is going to have to go through student identity. Plenty of people have already done these sorts of analyses on most of these metrics, but I don't see how eliminating affirmative action makes that process more efficient, and I don't think painting empirical metrics as plainly ""objective"" is either accurate or beneficial. We know they're confounded, and we know what some of those confounds are!","1_3_1_1_2_1_1_1_1"

See now youve just moved the goalpost and tried to make an argument based in this false reality. Its not arbitrary. The foundations of this entire argument are delusional. The whole point of academia is that it is *not* arbitrary and racist, but is a meritocracy. It may not be perfect, but dont let perfection be the enemy of good and throw out the baby with the bath water.

The people who get rejected from Harvard go to other schools like Yale, Stanford, Oxford, MIT and Princeton. If they get rejected from those schools too, then they go to 2nd and 3rd tier schools like Syracuse and Pratt. That *increases* the competition of the study body at those schools. That raises the economic productivity from all colleges and is better for the economy when only smart people get into college and graduate.

But when you just assume this self-fulfilling arbitrary process, the 2nd and 3rd tier schools end up rejecting students for being too smart in favor of diversity hires. The problem with affirmative action is not so much as the Ivy League as much as it is 2nd and 3rd tier schools because that is where poor whites often go because they rely on those merit based scholarships. The downstream impact of this arbitrary process is that the economy becomes less and less competitive against China, Russia and the global south while we are focused on inflationary inclusion policies.

Again, if you care about American primacy and growing the economy to be competitive in a globalized world, we need competition.

Capitalism without competition is not capitalism.","3_1"

People are using this logic to psychologically displace their economic conditions on to others. You had it easy because you grew up without crime and I had to crawl out of the hood instead of become the captain of a non-existent chess club is the sort of sentiment.

Thats called life. The purpose of academia is not to level the playing field in terms of life. Some people are born with extra chromosomes, others with severe disabilities, others without a father present. Should we have a fatherlessness scholarship now? Studies show that men with present fathers perform better in school. 

I can tell you based on my high school experience from Walt Whitman High in Bethesda, Maryland that I balanced school and extra-curricular culture score. Did growing up down the street from NIH and away from crime contribute to that? Absolutely, my family chose this place because it had the best jazz band and best physics. Why should my family be penalized for making good choices? I was the snare captain of the drum line, the jazz band drummer, played gigs with college aged guys on the weekends, created my own club, dated the hot cheerleader and always threw parties at my house. Colleges and business want leaders who can network and ultimately make money. I focused on ONE AP course  AP Physics C mechanics  and the rest of my time went to music and tail. Thats what leaders do. Thats what predicted my success in college. I was the lead designer of the NASA grant and assumed other leadership roles that changed the world. 

All of the nerds who wasted their prime years of their life nose-deep in books instead of mini-skirts didnt become business leaders or pioneers  they ended up working for me. 

The 1st law of economics is supply and demand. Anyone can study for 8 hours, but can they arrange a group of people to accomplish a goal? Can they change the world? Thats what colleges want their reputation to reflect. AI can replace nerds& but they cant replace leaders.

That being said, as a leader, I got only one question wrong in the ACT science section. Other students who failed the ACT and basic physics were not capable of meeting the MINIMUM standards to participate in the NASA grant, but because of affirmative action, then, CEI DEI, they were forced into the grant, slowing down the progress, sometimes intentionally. AA *in theory* happens after the standards are met but because some are ideologically driven to right the wrongs of history they end up lowering the standards to meet that goal *in practice*.

So this idea that you can right the injustice of unequal upbringing is tragically delusional. Your brain develops in stages and you lose grey matter over time. If you grew up with a bad environment, college handouts wont fix that. My parents paid $100 for a tutor from Georgetown (my fathers alma mater) to teach me basic arithmetic in elementary school, and because of it, my brain developed differently than another less privileged student who grew up fatherless on the streets. That doesnt make me better or worse, that is just reality: your childhood sticks with you. The sad reality is that your personality develops at a young age and youre stuck as that person. We hand these people everything they wanted in terms of inclusion into research and grants and they blew it. I witnessed it. The student from [a controlled country] had no education in ecology or physics and they walked into the NASA grant and I had to explain the Coriolis effect to them, using just TWO lines of basic algebra to summarize decades of my education. They slowed the whole thing down, in one case, intentionally, as they admit to me later on. That is my experience with affirmative action. People who cant meet the standards everyone else has to abide by just drag us all down with them.","3_1_1_1"

I think the lesson here is balance.

High school, college, grad school, research and business favor robust candidates who engage all 7 forms of intelligence and some leadership skills. The Asian group who sued Harvard focused only on the testing merit while disregarding culture merit. The AA proponents focused only on the culture merit while disregarding testing merit. 

But this balance will not reverse 400 years of oppression in 10 years, and people need to come to terms with that reality. It will take decades to establish the black owned suburbs and businesses that allow for a true equal upbringing. Until we solve the housing crisis, which I believe is the root cause of the issue AA attempts to solve, then we are just putting a rainbow bandaid on cancer, putting CEI ally on the brochure without actually helping the community fight cancer. The reality is that it is not the role of the college to parent students  it is simply a life learning litmus test.

Now that AA was over-ruled, we can in theory select a student body where *diversity is the symptom of meritocracy* rather than an imposed ideology, wherein the metrics that measure merit are what they have always been: 

#test scores + culture scores.

But then certain schools, clinging on to the Marxist ideology of equality of outcome known as equity will re-define the culture score not to mean leadership skills but some type of response to adversity. So people like me, despite being the leader of multiple groups with multiple talents, will be penalized for our privilege scores because we had no serious adversity. When I scored the highest on my ecology for architects multiple choice exam, an exam where I was the only A letter grade and many of my peers failed, they rationalized their failure by saying that oh you took adderall and grew up in Bethesda so you had an advantage as to disregard my MONTHS of studying hard for that exam. The school removed the test  the same ecology test it had for decades  and said that testing was racist, but specifically, a white supremacist construct. They basically called me a Nazi because I studied for an ecology exam.

What the ruling does is set the stage for future lawsuits against these type of Marxists who continue to perpetuate this racist ideology through other legal avenues. Next, SCOTUS will likely go after CEI DEI agendas, arguing that the *hiring* based on race/sex is unconstitutional, using this ruling as a precedent. Then, colleges will be forced to justify their more transparent selection process or face legal scrutiny.

There will be lawsuits after lawsuits after lawsuits at these type of CEI DEI ASLGBTQ+ schools and they may be forced into bankruptcy unless they end these discriminatory practices. There will be class action lawsuits for people rejected from jobs based on quotas. Individuals will be prosecuted for fraud and promoting the type of hateful environment that led to me and my family getting multiple death threats from students.","3_1_1_1_1_1"

But here is my take on AA. I think it has run its course. Is it helping nonwhites/non-Asians anymore in meaningful way from socioeconomic perspectives anymore? I am an east Asian immigrant, and I dont see how AA has improved the livelihood of Black and Hispanic Americans in last 15 years. I do value diversity - I am in grad school, science should promote everyone regardless background - but not at the expense of sacrificing merits. And the ""empathy"" or ""personable"" parameter that Harvard used to score Asian candidates seemed contrived and targeted at them to reduce their numbers. If you have seen that race make up of the Harvard admission each year, youd quickly realize that their denial of ""hard race quota"" is a half-assed lie. What is the end goal of AA really? Is getting into a college the end goal? Or is it one of ways to improve the livelihood in a long run? 

That said, us Asian Americans need to dial back on prestige factors. I as an immigrant went to a state university for BS in chem E, and am in another state university for a PhD in food science.

As a prof, you don't really have academic supervision by anyone else. Everything is self-motivated. You create your lab, your work and research thrusts, your graduate students, your undergrads if you want them, everything. No one else tells you what to do except in administrative manners.

I do think affirmative action is hurting the quality of the research because the initial rules for promotions are being by-passed. In the department, there is a minimum grant (a K-award or an R01) you need to get in order to be considered for tenure track. However, some people do not have this and are still being promoted, because the department wants to have more female-PIs. They are funded by private donations, given to the head of the department, who directs it to these 'minorities'. It only angers the other researchers and I can't believe these women feel good about how they got their positions. I'm not at the point in my career that this affects me, but it contributes to feelings that academia is rigged and that you only can make it when you suck up to somebody who is in a higher position. Often, the most innovative ideas come from people who are non-agreeable and who don't agree with the scientific consensus, instead of people who suck up to the established researchers in order to be picked for a promotion.","2_1"

You may never need to prove who started a project, but it's always nice to know that you have evidence.)

If your boss won't give you any leeway to try and start your own projects, then it's time to leave.","3"

I'm already doing what you are suggesting in a certain way. Since the lab has become a 'one topic' lab, I have been working on my free time (evenings and weekends: 9-5 pays the bills, 6-12 builds the empire) on my own projects. Since I already know the PI is not interested in anything else, I keep them from myself. The projects are computational only and don't require any funding, but generate data and are a proof of my technical abilities and creative thinking, in order to apply for grants. My backup plan is to go back to residency, and since most grant opportunities have a maximum time after getting your PhD, however this time is reset after you finish residency.","3_1"
