It was overall, a reaction to decades and decades of policies and practices that generally disadvantaged such minorities from applying to jobs in favored industries and positions, as well as prevented them from being admitted to many universities. 

In short, it was (and is) an attempt to correct decades of racial inequities stemming from the near-apartheid policies of the USA prior to the Civil Rights movement. In theory, it is a noble goal striving to achieve racial equity and opportunities for all. 

In practice, it unfortunately means that ""quotas"" are put in place to ensure that X number of minorities are admitted to a university, or X number of minority applicants are hired for certain positions in a company - often regardless of qualifications. 

How this affects Asians and Asian-Americans, specifically with regard to university admissions, is that Asians, despite our obvious status as a minority (and one that has faced many and myriad forms of discrimination, bigotry, and even outright violence against us) we are lumped in with the ""privileged"" class of wealthy whites because Asian and Asian-American applicants to universities tend to have excellent grades, excellent test scores, many extra-curricular activities, in short - they generally have impressive resumes when applying for college. Meanwhile, the so-called ""disadvantaged"" minorities (primarily blacks and Latinos) get the advantages of Affirmative Action even if their grades and test scores are lower, just because of their skin color.","2"

Institutions throw money at affirmative action all the time and help maybe a few truly needy people but if that same money funded preschools or free school lunches in extremely poor areas, it would have more of an impact.

Furthermore, affirmative action can be over inclusive and under inclusive. I'm in law school, where applicants who are black or hispanic receive preferential treatment. I have a friend who comes from a very rich family and received all these acceptances into elite schools. In contrast, I had far fewer acceptances into such elite schools, despite having similar scores. Schools only cared that I checked the ""Asian"" box and not the ""other Asian"" box, indicating that I immigrated from an extremely poor country and grew up in an extremely impoverished area with few resources.

I support affirmative action, also as someone who had definitely felt discriminated against in college interviews. This case used Asians as a pawn to get rid of Affirmative action. Harvard was being discriminatory in their admissions towards Asians. They also, legally did not have to express their admissions process during this suit. Meaning affirmative action was being used as a straw man for a racist process, WHICH mostly benefits white rich legacy students (which Harvard did not have to disclose how much of the student body they took up)

Also I knew this shit would happen. The lawyer in this case used legal precedent that forced Yale admissions to admit more Jews when they discriminated against Jews in college apps in post WWII. Although in favor of affirmative action, The district courts ruling was soooo poorly written, there was no way it was not going to get appealed to the Supreme Court. But and progressives liberals ate that shit up. Harvard is racist TOWARDs Asians no doubt, which I disagree with, but Harvard used affirmative action as a shield for their racist admissions. People should be mad at Harvard for giving such a crappy defense-they killed affirmative action. 

Why I support affirmative action: having diversity supports individuals that have skills that dont necessarily translate to paper. Diversity is healthy and important and benefits society-but peoples natural instinct is to be afraid of diversity. Because it might not be whats best for me, but whats best for society. Also this is going to make more tension between Asians and other minorities, which is what those in power want-to divide and conquer.","7"

That said, I am frankly VERY suspicious about the kind of people who are cheering for this. It always seems like the wealthiest Asian Americans of Korean, Chinese and Indian descent who are complaining about not getting into Harvard and Yale. As a Chinese/Filipino from the Philippines, I never see SE Asians or Pakistani and Bangladeshi people complaining about Affirmative Action or not getting into the Ivy League. I also doubt that Asian enrollment will actually increase in most US universities at all (Legacy admissions are untouched and colleges can still use other means like personality to discriminate against Asians)

Personally, I think its a sign that the Democrats and Liberal/Progressive ideologies are becoming unpopular with Asian Americans (or at least the wealthier ones from China, India and S. Korea). I wouldnt be surprised to find a majority of Asians voting for Trump or DeSantis next election as a result of hate crimes committed by black criminals in California and stupid culture wars like this. Im not sympathetic to their perspective mostly because Trump totally destroyed my life while I was in university with his COVID policies, and I live in SE Asia where we need the US to defend us against China.","8_1"

I do think certain group of people regardless of their race are put in situations/environments where they need to overcome more obstacles to be as competitive as others. However, efforts should be made and helps should be offered at an earlier stage and lower level of education. AA can only helped a small portion of kids from those groups, but vast majority of the kids from those groups dont even have the chance to get the favor offered by AA. 
Therefore, in my opinion, AA not only harm kids from my race groups chance of getting the best education opportunities they deserve, it is also a proof of not willing to tackle the real issues those who need help are actually facing.","9"
