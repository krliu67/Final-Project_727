"2020-01-03",1578025850,"32yo MD, PhD post-doc, struggling to see a path forward for a career in research, asking for some advice.","I'm a 32 year old post-doc from Europe (MD, PhD, resident in Pathology) in a successful cancer research lab at a prestigious US university. Previous post-docs in the lab were able to do multiple, different projects, as in the beginning, the PI was dependent on collaborations with other researchers. The PI is very well-known in the field I thought that I would be able to learn a lot in the lab. I was initially put on a project, where the PI got a lot of money for, however collaborators did not provide the required specimens (cancer tissues). Initially, I also contributed tissue from my university in Europe, but this was not enough. Although i was not told before I was in the lab, I was hired to do micro-dissection on the samples for this project (since I am a resident in pathology). However, a year after I started, another project was published in one of the CNS journals and all focus  moved to that project: a company was founded and everybody is working on validating the initial study (often brainless work, that I think should be done in the company and not by the cheap labor of grad-students).

(I don't want to brag, but this is my honest assessment:) I'm the most qualified person in the lab: I do both all my lab work and the analyses (which are often computational intensive: I know how to program (python, R) and how to run NGS-analyses pipelines, before I joined the lab). Since my initial project failed, I'm now being used in the same 'pipeline' as grad students (but I don't get as much one-on-one time as grad-students). and I don't get the opportunity to develop my own ideas.

I have asked a researcher outside the lab for advice and he referred me to the 'Avoid Boring People'-book from James Watson (more specifically to the passage where Watson decided to leave his PI, because he didn't think he was learning the things he wanted to learn). I'm thinking of moving back to Europe with my wife (American), who also wants to leave the university (she is a research associate). When I told the PI that I might leave the lab by the end of 2020, he told me he wanted to support me later, which he has done for another post-doc, who is now a PI under him. However, the PI has never 'mentored' me and he has never given me advice. Before I joined the lab, he asked me to fill out an 8-page questionnaire, which I'm sure he never read (with questions like: ""where do you see yourself in 5 years""). In the year before I joined the lab, I had thought about 2-3 projects which I wanted to propose, but he has never had time to listen to them and give his views on them. I don't want to be grand-fathered into a position without having a good paper by myself: these promises in the future set me up for a subordinate role where I can't develop my ideas and where I have to subscribe to the scientific consensus. I know my pathology and computational biology skills are in high-demand and I might have gone to a 'too-good' lab that doesn't value me. I feel like a failure, but I'm also eager to proof that I can be successful, even in a market with less grant-money, like the EU. I still very much respect my PI for his scientific achievements and his vision. But the lack of investment in the 'future' like in young researchers, bothers me. It hate how the reward system works for PIs: risky projects where only a small percentage succeed, are better for a PI than helping all their grad-students and post-docs succeed in their dreams of a scientific career. I have spoken with some of the bright grad-students and post-docs, who have expressed similar complaints.

I'm generally disappointed in research: it has become industrial and top-down, which makes it very uninteresting for grad-students and post-docs. In Europe, I had very interesting and intellectual and conceptual discussions with my bosses, about how to do elegant and creative research. In the US institute where I'm now, it is about processing hundreds of samples and being a brainless robot. I see how people who are brainless robots and who have no creative mind at all, have been promoted to tenure-track positions. They don't get any national grants and live from the money from millionaires who were directed to them by the head of the department, who 'believes' in these brainless robots (sometimes because of positive discrimination/affirmative action). It is easier to convince a millionaire who cannot assess how good the research-proposal is, to give money, then to convince your peers...","academia",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/eja7tv/32yo_md_phd_postdoc_struggling_to_see_a_path/"
"2023-07-31",1690836052,"UC Office of Student Conduct retaliation against unionized workers","One of my friends was involved in the UAW 2865 collective action earlier this year which triggered retaltiation against union activity by the UC admin.

Timeline of events for this scenario:

\-during 2022 UAW 2865/5810 strike one of the workers striked with their coworkers

\-manager of that one worker illegally retaliated against the worker for striking, threatening the worker's status at the institution after performing work duties just fine up to the date of the strike

\-workers made mild and medium appeals to stop the retaliation, to deaf ears

\-after months of trying 'proper channels' to adress issue with no progress, workers decided collective action was needed

\-gathered to protest at the manager's place of work

\-manager refused to engage with the underlying issue, called the corporate police, fled the scene

\-corporation then used resources such as a sham 'judicial' process to retaliate further against workers, singling out workers who stood in solidarity with the original worker

\-now many of the workers involved have been put on 'probation', told they are not able to protest or engage in labor activity without further consequences, and have to write an essay

&amp;#x200B;

............needless to say this whole situation stinks of unconstitutional abuse of power by the corporation. 

I encourage you to read the essay attached to this post since it goes into the long list of legal precedents as well as contract language. The essay is what one of my friends who has been targetted by this union retaliation has written in response to the university's behavior

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: UC is incurring incredible legal liability upon itself by refusing to follow the plain-face reading of law such as the constitution, centuries of precedent in federal and state, and the language of the contract itself which reinforces the language of the mentioned laws. This retaliation does not make their workers more productive or happy, and comes off as blatant abuse of institutional power to crush union activity

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: You are required to write a research paper about the resources to make informed decisions about engaging in expressive activity, differences between speech forums, how your conduct impacted others, and how you would perceive the conduct if it had been directed at you

&amp;#x200B;

Feuds throughout history are fueled from the low level of economic inconvenience to all out war. Thankfully living in a time where disagreements have many avenues of peaceful resolution, we still find consistent provocatory violence meant to extend feudal unpleasantry ad infinitum. Both sides feeling the aggrieved need to retaliate &amp; escalate; however, asymmetry of power and tactics often exists. Institutional &amp; economic asymmetry as primary sources of aforementioned dynamics ie the have-nots want a decent standard of living while the haves seek to defend their castle.

The context of the case is an organization primarily consisting of a group of striking workers, striking after months unfair labor practices,bad faith bargaining &amp; retaliation, from the corporation. One worker in particular had his status of belonging threatened by a manager, despite performing duties adequately up until the strike. Then upon legal sanction of said strike ideally protected the worker from retaliation for their position, in other words their labor rights ideally protected their status. Yet the retaliation was levied by the manager against mild and medium levels of protest at first, all proper channels eventually being exhausted to lift the managers charge then leading to organization among workers about how to address the abuse. Consensus came to of the illegality under statutes such as NLRA, FLSA, California Labor Code Section 923, FEHA, etc& the workers decided given the context of failure of proper channels that collective action was needed, such as a protest, in order to protect their coworker. The workers temporarily paused the other work, which most would rather be doing but felt the need to defend their rights, in order to brief the case to each other &amp; petition the manager for redress. The manager reported these workers to the authorities and fled the scene, choosing to continue abusing the worker. Certain workers were singled out from the collective for further abuse and retaliation. This document is a product of this process pursued to punish organized labor. 

So on to exploring the history of expressive activity, the precedent for free speech and assembly, how conduct impacts others, how an ethical actor might compose themselves under the principles of utilitarian consequentialism. For a too long dont read summary I would say if workers protested my managerial abuse, I might consider how to redress and resuscitate relations between all parties in order to establish a healthy, productive working environment. Consider not committing illegal acts retaliating against workers striking underneath me, instead advocating on their behalf if their case is reasonable and sound, resolving the underlying issue to the best of my ability. Not only the right thing to do given the case, but avoids all ripple effects such as legal liability, which institution ultimately cares about, &amp; healthy work environment. 

Any advocate of the aspirational principles within our founding such as the bill of rights would agree the right to protest, engage in organized labor activity, and not be harassed or retaliated against for engaging in such activities is protected under the law, but effective enforcement of these rights often requires taking proactive measures beyond traditional channels. This dynamic is at the heart of our nation. There is no need to continue this feud, sirs and ladies; no need to abuse our interdependence. 

	The right to protest is foundational in U.S. law and is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition. ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" Thus, the right to protest by expressing discontent and assembling peacefully has been an integral part of American democracy since its inception. Another critical case of precedent is Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), where the court ruled that students do not lose their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate, illustrating the wide reach of First Amendment protections. Given the context that the workers in question wore multiple hats, one of which being student; however, their primary role at the corporation was to teach and conduct research, but such are graduate studies. California also strongly upholds the right to protest. The state's constitution contains an affirmative right to free speech and assembly which is interpreted more broadly than the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act in California penalizes anyone who interferes with another's constitutional rights through threats, intimidation, or coercion. This act can extend to situations involving protest rights.

	In our case, workers utilized their right to protest in response to a perceived injustice. We had the right to gather, express our views, and request a peaceful resolution. The retaliation we face following our protest raises questions about whether our rights are adequately respected &amp; upheld.

	Since the case in question is regarding union activity even more legal precedent applies for speech. Labor rights, including the right to form and join labor unions, strike, and engage in collective bargaining, are fundamental rights in the U.S. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, is a cornerstone of American labor law. It established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and gave it the power to enforce employees' rights to collectively bargain and organize. The Act also prevents employers from committing unfair labor practices that might discourage organizing or discriminate against union members. Under the NLRA, employees have the right to engage in ""concerted activities"", which include strikes, for mutual aid or protection. California has several laws that further enhance labor rights. The California Labor Code, for instance, has numerous sections that protect union activity and prohibit employer interference with such activity. Additionally, the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act gives local government employees in California the right to organize and bargain collectively, with UC running nearly a dozen company towns across the state, the largest employer in California some years. The point being made that this law would seem applicable under the interpretation that UC is highly interconnected with governmental structures and often runs a local government proxy within their university districts. More importantly the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) extends similar legal protections to employees of the University of California, California State University, and the state's community colleges within a standalone law. Needless to say our current situation might serve as a case study in the regulated socioeconomic dynamics. 

	Regarding harassment and retaliation we find the following legal context.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and also prohibits retaliation against individuals who assert their rights under the law. Individuals in this case come from diverse backgrounds, with the primary worker of interest being a protected class from amongst these, specificity to which lacking for identity protection but suffice to say the universitys threat upon his career was beyond just losing a job hence the protected class. California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits harassment and discrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, mental and physical disability, medical condition, age, pregnancy, denial of medical and family care leave, or pregnancy disability leave. It also prohibits retaliation against individuals who assert their rights under the law. Furthermore, the California Labor Code contains several sections that specifically prohibit retaliation against employees for a variety of protected activities. For example, Section 1102.5 prohibits employer retaliation against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency when the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal statute. 

So much legal precedent! The heart of the feud beginning with the individual worker and individual manager is particularly about discrimination related to one of these protected classes, again not specifying which for purposes of identity protection. The corporation was using its infrastructural advantage to isolate and threaten one of the most vulnerable workers in the southernmost company town to leave the picket line. 

	This is all in the context of failure of proper channels which had fallen short for months to resolve the underlying issue and continued to load the corporation in question with high level legal liability, up to the constitutional level. Such proper channels being the student appealing the decision with the professor as well as the department, demonstrating the illegality of the decision, finding ambassadors among the faculty and staff to try and resolve the situation, expressing the grievance to colleagues and coworkers to reach out themselves in a peaceful stochastic manner to the professor and admin, trying over and over for months to peacefully appeal the onerous decision, filing grievances and other legal documentation, continued communications, etc&.. No progress, stonewall, threats of further retaliation. Most grievances find no plasticity from the corporation until the issue is taken to arbitration at huge expense to both sides which almost inevitably goes towards the workers common sense, plain-face reading of the contractual language &amp; case law. The corporationg often favors dragging out the process for months &amp; months. This is what proper channels often look like; hence collective action to enforce labor rights, contract agreements, dignity for the victim &amp; the abuser, legal upstanding of the institution, and work environment health ie productivity. 

The workers met the manager while working with a second manager &amp; a small group of company town citizens, politely requesting to have a moment of his time while the second manager led the meeting as he professed he had been doing already up until the interruption. The manager refused to engage the underlying issue, contacted corporate security, and fled the scene. Now months later the corporation has singled out and harassed members of that protest, initiated a similar harassment campaign upon another group of workers x7 the size, and even violated the 4th amendment by arresting and detaining worker citizens of the company town without filing any charges ie undue seizure. Use of institutional power to act outside of the basic law of the land in case after case, creating company town kangaroo courts to put the singled out subjects to a trial where the process and outcome are not about justice but isolation, ostracization , and to send a message to all others who might dissent even in defense of their coworkers. This is the response workers get for simplying requesting bosses follow the law and the negotiated contract. 

	As for the perception of the incident, theres a few parties to consider. Most of the younger corporate citizens and workers were actually well known to the members of the protest. I for example immediately identified a handful of the dozen or so people upon entering the workplace environment in question. Their response was confusion but then mostly positive affirmation, amusement &amp; some admiration was expressed later for our defense of each other. The managers were absolutely appalled, breathless in shock. Despite being experts of highly complex fields &amp; dynamics, they didnt seem to be able to comprehend how the dynamics of socioeconomic &amp; constitutional law which the violation of was the subject of the workers message, with a written notice &amp; highly peaceful ambassadorship. The managers filed a corporate report, choosing to trial the workers in the underclass of the company town despite the workers special status under legally binding contract &amp; all of the above legal precedent. Yet another form of harassment. One would think the corporation would rather the workers have more time to work within their specialized skillset as hired for, rather than meaningless administrative bureaucracy as a form of retaliation &amp; blatant contractual mis-alignment. As for the broader corporation by far more people would, upon hearing both sides of the story, tend to side with resolution of worker rights as is the baseline of societal trust. As was the response to vast majorities of the wider public for scenarios such as these. At the end of the day arguing ad populum, ie perception or optics, is folly given the existence of basic ethics so the reader might wonder why was this even a question of the prompt? 

	Again, needless to say, I dont overtly and intentionally abuse the underclasses of workers below me, and if a collective of them pointed out my illegality in actually committing such acts I would seek immediate remedy. In other words, if this happened to me I wouldnt sadistically retaliate, fleeing my own illegality under labor law if I was the manager. So many reasons why to choose an ameliorative response, too exhaustive to expand upon basic ethics and law. The bill of rights is taught to elementary and middle school children. 

	Also as a final note, we havent even delved into the detail of the contract since the legal precedent is comprehensive enough; however, for the curious the most relevant clauses of the contract would be, within the Non-Discrimination in Employment, the University shall not discriminate against or harass any ASE/GSR on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, HIV status, uniformed service, age, citizenship, political affiliation, and/or union activity. Another nail being driven into the coffin, the recommended action moving forward would be for workers to continue emphasizing nonviolence as they protest for redress of grievances, and for the corporation to avoid legal liability by following the terms of the contract, state law, and federal statutes. 

Thank you for the opportunity to review foundational rights.
