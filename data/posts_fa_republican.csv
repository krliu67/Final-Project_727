"2013-10-22",1382480216,"Does Jon Stewart Agree With Marco Rubio on the delay of the individual mandate? Do Progressive/Liberal/Democrats agree with Jon?","Here is Jon Stewart with HHS Head Kathlene Sibelius:

http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/08/jon-stewart-accuses-kathleen-sebelius-of-lying-to-him-about-obamacare/

&gt;I still dont understand why individuals have to sign up and businesses dont, because if the businesses  if shes saying, well, they get a delay because that doesnt matter anyway because they already give health care, then you think to yourself, fuck it, then why do they have to sign up at all, he said. And then I think to myself, well, maybe shes just lying to me.

&gt;During the interview, Stewart said criticism over the seeming double standard was very legitimate.

&gt;But if Im if an individual Im wondering  well, an individual who doesnt want this because there are individuals clearly that want this  but if Im an individual that doesnt want it, it would be hard for me to look at big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to because I would think, geez, it looks like because I dont have a lobbying group, he told Sebelius. I would feel like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you to delay it because they didnt want to do this year but you are not allowing individuals that same courtesy.


And Marco Rubio:

&gt;He called effort to postpone the Obamacare measure a ""prudent approach."" On ""CBS This Morning,"" he said, ""It's unfair to punish people for not purchasing a product that they can't purchase right now because of the technology that's in place, the web site they're supposed to buy it on -- by the president's own admission -- is not working.

&gt;Rubio said he's hopeful the measure will pass, especially as the deadline draws closer. ""As weeks go on, there's going to be a look for a solution to the problem. It's not fair to punish people for buying something that's not available,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, I think that's where we're going to have to wind up anyway. You saw yesterday, the White House didn't rule out a delay. Jay Carney didn't rule it out because they understand that the problems that this web site faces are significant and are going to be very difficult to fix in a number of weeks.""

So is this a rare moment where Progressive/Liberal/Democrats  and Tea Party/Republican/Conservatives agree on something. I hope Mr. Rubio calls Jon and asks to go on the show!
