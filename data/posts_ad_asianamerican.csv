"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

Much like the crack epidemic not given attention when it was a 'black problem', and need for 'intervention' to help opioid addicts who are now manly a white demographic, we have a similar analogy with Asian Americans.

To this very fucking day, Caucasian provosts (WASP/Jewish) routinely use non transparent admissions policies, while taking on huge grants and fellowships from taxpayer dollars (ie Pell) to deny  Asian Americans admissions into their universities. A lot of the focus has been on undergrad in these discrepencies, but its more pronounces in grad programs. I once read, for instance, that MCAT score ranges for admitted Asians were around the 90% , while for Latinos it was around 60% (majority of whom are of course blanco/whites. Hispanic being a non existent category outsid eof the US)

It got me thinking. My family has doctors in it who  took immense risks, had to spend more time/capital (ie get another mastesr) to 're-brand' themselves for med school. $200k+ med school debt isn't unheard of, horrible living conditions to 'save', mental stress if they don't get in, etc.

Why is it that we are discussing 'student debt relief' before we discuss the non transparent admissions processes that discriminate asian americans? 

Because its now affecting the younger generation of whites.","asianamerican",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/cn5dgb/the_whole_student_debt_relief_movementhypocrisy/"

"80/20 (Asian American advocacy PAC) needs our support!!","2015-07-11",1436649098,"80/20 (Asian American advocacy PAC) needs our support!!","80/20 is one of the few Asian American PACs that truly have our best interests at heart, but now they're struggling on life support and **WILL SHUT DOWN** without additional funding.  They were one of the 60 groups lobbying against Harvard for discrimination.

http://80-20initiative.blogspot.com/2015/07/either-sufficient-support-or-death.html?m=1

Q&amp;amp;A on the Life or Death of 80-20 PAC

Q1:  Why has 80-20 PAC chosen death rather than hanging on?

&gt;80-20 has seen many similar AsAm organizations providing negative service to our community. 80-20 PAC could one day become a negative-service organization. So it is better to cease operations  than struggle to hang on.

**Q2:  Negative service?  Could you give an example?**

&gt;**The support for ""race conscious"" college admissions by many so-called ""AsAm civil rights orgs"" is one example.** Even when discrimination against  AsAm  college applicants became so obvious  that school counselors have to advise our kids to hide their AsAm ethnic  background  when applying - a clear  indication that AsAms don't even have  the minimal human  rights of  self-respect, these civil right orgs still didn't change their position.  How ugly the real world can be!

**Q3:  Do these civil rights org. WANT to harm our community? (A must read!!)**

&gt;NO!  They drifted into it.  The first generation founders were usually volunteers &amp;amp; had noble  intentions .  But sooner or later, they  faded away.  The later leaders were usually paid a salary. They might not be as dedicated  and/or as capable. Lacking prestige, the subsequent  leaders couldn't raise enough money from the  AsAm community.   **So they  began to go after grants from the generous mainstream foundations  and corporations.**     

&gt;However, raising money  from American orgs, that support civil rights, is almost impossible WITHOUT THE BLESSINGS of  NAACP. NAACP has won civil rights for all minorities of America, including us.   However, does NAACP always have the same interests as AsAms?    No!!  That is when AsAm civil rights orgs would and will support policies at  the expense of AsAms.   Money talks!   Make it talk for us.

Q4:  So is it the fault of these civil rights orgs?

&gt;NO!   The subsequent leaders of our civil rights orgs are mostly new college graduates.  They may be too young to face the tough real world.  

&gt;Personally, I primarily blame the successful AsAm business leaders  who, as a group, don't have the wisdom to bear the responsibility of financing  the  necessary community infrastructures - PACs, civil rights orgs, &amp;amp; think-tanks.

&gt;Instead, our rich  people compete  to give money to Harvard and buy a name on a Harvard  building.   A recent NY Times satire, entitled ""Harvard Admissions Needs 'Moneyball for Life' ""  stated: 
      
&gt;"" They (meaning the rich people who climb over each other to donate to Harvard)  weren't  put on earth to alleviate human suffering, or to make it a different and  better place. They were put on earth  to erect a building  with their name on it, in a place it  can be  seen and admired by other people like  them!""   

&gt;Please ""google"" to find out which wealthy AsAms are these belittled moneyballs. 

&gt;   The unwillingness of AsAm rich and powerful to invest in our community contrasts strikingly other minority communities.  Most AsAms are NOT willing to speak out on this point  for fear of offending these folks.  However, someone has to point out this HUGE weakness.  

              ""To those whom much is given, much is required."" 
                             -  John F. Kennedy, a Harvard graduate



80/20 has been one of our community's most staunch pro-Asian PACs for decades, and it didn't sell out like a lot of our other activist organizations that were desperate for funding.  Now is the time to make your commitment clear?  Please donate to help keep this organization alive, it's literally Zion and they're under siege by the Machines.  If they collapse, then one of the last bulwarks we have against White Supremacy is going to be destroyed.  I'm calling out to all Asian America.

"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","2014-01-14",1389675579,"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","When I see AAs arguing against affirmative action, most immediately go with the assumption that this is a conflict between minorities. They see their opponents are other underprivileged minorities who gets all the positions that they didn't get. The proposed solution that they give is always complete abolition, which I see as unlikely, especially in more liberal states.

I think the angle of approach to this issue needs to change in order to convince more people. Don't think of this problem as a dog-eat-dog contest between minorities. There are actually fairly good arguments for helping historically disadvantaged African Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to defeat it.

Instead the really unfair part of affirmative action (for me) is the fact that AAs actually have a HARDER time than Caucasians in this system. This makes absolutely no sense. Caucasians get white privilege, pre-existing old-boy social networks and historical legacy benefits, while AAs suffered historical discrimination and higher poverty rate, AND they should be given an even harder time now compared to white people? I am really surprised and disgruntled that this is not pointed out more whenever affirmative action is brought up.

If the admission rates of Caucasians and AAs for colleges are on the same level adjusted for test score (or in some better measure of admission equality, we are equal), I would be perfectly fine with affirmative action. It is a reasonable statement that white people don't need a crutch in life over Asians, right?

This point could have been chewed to death in some AA blog circles. I haven't been in the AA activism community for too long, so it is likely that I missed it. However, I have never seen it presented online, so I thought to get some discussions on it.","asianamerican",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1v63z3/discussion_i_dont_see_why_the_affirmative_action/"
"Affirmative Action  Harming Asians Most","2013-08-07",1375846976,"Affirmative Action  Harming Asians Most","I hate how Asians are stereotyped as being superior to Whites in college admissions, which forces them to limit their ranges of Asian students in incoming classes. That combined with the need to have diverse females and males screws over Asians. I was told by a former UPenn admissions officer that the worst demographic to be is Asian Male for all the reasons you can think of.

The NYT article Little Asia on the Hill explores the little known problem of Affirmative Action that affects Asian Americans. The article begins by describing how UC Berkley had a record high for Asians in their freshman class and what it was like for a student to be among such a large population of Asian students in the university.

&gt;    But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it  specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.

There have been long running suspicions among the Asian American community that they were often denied admission or wait-listed to make room for other students considered to be disadvantaged minorities. I find it interesting that although universities pride themselves on being tolerant and diverse, their admissions office uses a combination of stereotypes and impossible standards to create what they believe to be an incoming class with perfect diversity. It seems absurd that admissions officials would assess an Asian student at a much higher standard than his White counterparts because they are a supposedly superior Model Minority while judging African-Americans and Hispanics at a much lower standard using Whites as a neutral benchmark because they are implied to be inferior disadvantaged minorities. Additionally, it is even more racist to use Whites as a neutral standard in judging which groups are superior to receive harder burdens from the admissions officers, while using a lesser standard on the other groups, which appear to reaffirm the age-old American perception that Asians are superior while Blacks/Hispanics are not.

&gt;    Asians have become the new Jews, in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, The Price of Admission: How Americas Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges  and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.

&gt;    As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent)  despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.

&gt;    To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.

&gt;    This is just a very, very egregious system, Mr. Li told me. Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.

&gt;    To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.

&gt;    Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. Im not seeking anything personally, he says. Im happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.","asianamerican",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1juzmv/affirmative_action_harming_asians_most/"

At a time where many university students are examining the role of race in places of elite and privileged learning, many on this forum have asked what our role as AAs are among other minority groups. 

One of the things to highlight may be how elite institutions (e.g. the Ivy League), have put into place discriminatory quotas in AA admissions. Several peer reviewed academic papers have concluded that there is very real statistical evidence that such a quota exists (ironically, the more heavily cited ones come from Princeton). 

Perhaps if we too are to join other PoC in their fight, perhaps our place is to also ask elite institutions for transparency. The Ivy League notoriously keeps admissions statistics private, however, if they are to have a fair and balanced admission strategy, perhaps they too should not worry about releasing the GPAs, SATs, and other factors by race.

"Does this sub really have a disdain for Affirmative Action?","2019-04-23",1556041025,"Does this sub really have a disdain for Affirmative Action?","After looking up some information about Affirmative Action, I also saw a reddit thread on this sub with many people saying AA shouldn't have been implemented to begin with. After searching ""Affirmative Action Reddit"", I came across even more posts and comments like this from this sub. I want to present an argument, and then a question based on the premise of the argument. I myself am Asian American, so I had to fill in the box when applying for schools too you know. Anyways.

Let's start with median incomes in the US

Asians - 80K  
White - 61K  
US median - 57K  
Pacific Islander - 57K  
Hispanic/Latino - 46K  
Other races - 44K  
Native American - 39K  
Black - 38K

So basically, Affirmative Action serves to be one of many, MANY initiatives aiming to get any race under the US median TO the US median. In theory, if all humans are capable of the same achievements in our civilization then discrepancies shouldn't be this great. But it's very obvious how the median incomes drop hard between Pacific Islanders and Hispanic/Latinos, and once again down to Native Americans and Blacks considered against the ""others"" option.

It may be worth it to also present these groups by per capita income as well

Asians - 34K  
White - 32K  
Pacific Islander - 21K  
Black - 20K  
Native American - 18K  
Hispanic/Latino - 16K

Amazingly, the drop off happens after White and that's it. Black Americans aren't actually at the bottom per-capita, which probably implies that there are more people poorer than the median than richer. Just to be clear, since the per-capita incomes are all less than the medians here, ALL of America's per-capita incomes have a bell curve that skews left. [An example just to be absolutely sure we're on the same page](http://jse.amstat.org/v13n2/vonhippel_figure1.gif). It's just that some skew harder or have less of a tail, implied by the re-ordering.

Back to affirmative action. Basically, Affirmative Action is a policy implemented by certain public systems, and even the private sector, to determine who is suitable for acceptance into a school, workplace, etc. when competition is present. It leads to outcomes where if two people of similar merit went for a job, but one was from a race which has a higher per-capita income, then they might be not be favoured. This is seen as controversial by many, because it can be seen as racist.

I believe that, despite being Asian American, I don't really mind Affirmative Action as a concept. I DO believe it needs reform, especially since poor whites are left behind by these programs, but it is sound in-theory simply because the different in income stats is so great that there's CLEARLY a problem that needs fixing here just due to America's history. If initiatives aren't taken to alleviate these problems in a meritocracy, then we could end up repeating the cycle that brought us to this point, as Americans.  


1. These income ratios between races would stay the same
2. After some time, the lesser income races would get profiled as uneducated, dangerous, etc. simply due to their lower average income (even when they're middle class).
3. Successful kids from lower income races succeed, and start to favour affirmative action due to these problems.
4. Affirmative Action is implemented
5. Affirmative Action is cut due to being against the idea of a perfect meritocracy
6. Repeat?  


Let me put it this way. What would you, as a person, see as more impressive? A black kid born into a low-income neighborhood with parents that value education but absolutely toxic bullies in elementary and middle school, and they don't have the means to send their kid to a private school. This black kid has to stay away from every bad influence he meets, even if that means becoming a total outcast. Also, he starts working a job while in highschool while some of his friends flunk entirely. He gets a 3.8 average in highschool regardless. He's also shown himself to have a kind heart and a passion for helping those around him. Or. A white kid born into a family where the father does Real-Estate somewhat successfully and the mother works in IT in a small company. This white kid's parents also value education, and they're able to send him to a private school as such. He gets a 3.6 there. However, colleges weigh students from that private school as 0.4 GPA higher relative to the black kid's public school. So he would effectively be a 4.0 student in public school, in their eyes. That said, he didn't really get bullied, and most bad influences were only as bad as they needed to be without actually doing bad academically. The truly bad influences, the types of guys that will flunk out, he also avoids just like the black kid, but at a private school there aren't many of those (I went to a private school and there was only 1 guy like that, period). Overall, he's a good kid with a kind heart too. Volunteers and does service all the time. Honestly, it may be hard, but I UNDERSTAND the reason AA would pick the black kid. By giving this black kid more resources than he ever had in the past, you have the potential to make a successful black kid, then a successful black adult, and then a successful black adult who also uplifts his originally low-income neighborhood if he chooses to stay around that culture. I've seen it with my own eyes too. I go to a mosque here in Atlanta in a black neighborhood occasionally, and the adults that lead this mosque are very proper and are always making strides to give back to the community. They've pretty much changed the culture in their part of Atlanta alongside the three churches and the school in that area, through what I've gathered talking to them (they're old people). I can affirm this, because going a few blocks east or west of that neighborhood brings you to uneducated Atlanta, like Pittsburgh or Lakewood.

I understand that the context of AA for Asian Americans is that Asians have higher incomes and education, and it's HEAVILY due to the amount of vetting and barriers to immigration (AKA brain-drain from our ancestor countries ugh). But beyond this, I don't really see this as a big deal. I still got into the college I wanted to, a very prestigious one at that (Emory). In fact, my background of being the son of two doctors that went to a private school probably has something to do with it, considering I got a 3.2 in highschool. In the grand scheme of American civilization, I'm willing to have a slightly higher bar for success than others if it means that America as a whole is benefiting tenfold. Now, AGAIN, there are so many flaws with actual implemented AA, that I think prevents me from supporting it as it is now. I believe that it needs to be reformed so that it targets low-income situations much more than situations by race. There was a case of a low-income Asian being discriminated in Harvard admissions over a middle-income black kid that led to controversy a while back. In subsequent years, [movements](http://time.com/5425147/harvard-affirmative-action-trial-asian-american-students/) have been made to combat this problem, and I do agree with it to a certain extent. We need to target concentrated poverty, more or less. But otherwise I do support the mission it is trying to achieve. *The racial implications of AA only exist because #2 above happens, people make stereotypes of races based on the average income of that race and how people of those incomes usually act or live. And this leads to prejudice. If people weren't prone to casual racism, I do believe there'd be less support for AA. But is that reality? It's up to you to decide.*

Written by Steven Pinker.  He's a notable scientist and a Harvard professor, and here's his take.  Although he references Ron Unz's famous piece on Asian-American discrimination, this isn't just about Asian-Americans.  Affirmative action is a crux issue within our community, so it's nice to have one of today's great minds give us their opinion on this.

I'm pretty outspoken about how horrible holistic admissions or affirmative action are, and how meritocratic admissions is both more ethical and superior in student body.  On ethical grounds alone, I'm against systemic racism.  However, I suspect Pinker's thoughts on it are of more interest than mine.","asianamerican",36,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/2fnx0i/the_ivy_league_is_broken_and_only_standardized/"
