This is simply statistics. To paraphrase, the distribution of the outcome is very different from the input's distribution **while** assuming there are no intrinsic factors that influence the outcome.

&gt; Equality of opportunity = equality

&gt; Equality of outcomes = dystopian nightmare

How do you define opportunity?  If I give you $10K and a year's training on *How the Stock Market Works*.  Then I give another person $10K and never even let them know the Stock Market exists, much less how to use it.  Have I given you both *opportunity*?  

I would argue that technically I have.  But we can clearly see that all else being equal, one person is much more likely to succeed than the other.

For example if IBM hired 10,000 new IT workers and the vast majority are white males.  This data would show a correlation of discrimination but would not necessarily be significant.  Turns out that people drawn to IT at the moment are mainly males,  white males particularly apply at an extremely high rate and study for IT credentials at a very high rate.  Getting female applicants is difficult as there is less interest in the field.  Does this mean females and minorities are being discriminated against... perhaps but perhaps not the numbers are not necessarily significant. 

Another example:  Increased diagnosis of Autism matches closely with increased TV and Screen time of children.  This correlation is interesting however does not mean TV/Screen time causes Autism.  It could?  But for now it is just an interesting correlation. 

So different rates of racial acceptance rate is interesting and can be useful data in supporting a case for discrimination but by itself is not significant.  Further creating a world where all identities are equally represented everywhere at all schools, jobs, etc is the essentially the plot line of most Dystopian novels (and for good reason).

Here is a cool short story by Kurt Vonnegut that deals with some negatives around the concepts of ""equality"" especially equality of outcomes.  If you don't agree with me, no worries however I still recommend the story very good :)

If you were to argue, for example, that African American culture does not value education quite as much as Asian American cultures do and that this explains the college gap, the relevant inequality of opportunity is the unequal opportunity to be born into a home where education is highly valued (which not an advantage to sneeze at). If there's a difference in the conditional probability of success given a biologically irrelevant attribute like skin color, there is no practical equality of opportunity.

&gt; the explanation is then rooted in a matter of opportunity ***or interest.***

As you said, ""Being born into a culture that does value education as much as other presents an obvious barrier."" and that defines an important part of the problem - this isn't necessarily so much a matter of opportunity being denied as opportunity being neglected or rejected.

To the extent that a community or individual rejects an available opportunity, it isn't fair to tar those who provide the opportunity with the brush of racist/sexist/whatever discrimination.

If one does not have equal access to that conditioning and nurturing, he does not have an equal opportunity at success. 

Public schools were established to make sure that future generations of citizens are imbued with some basic common values and have the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In too many instances, we *are* failing to meet those objective.

Still, whether you call it conditioning or nurturing or inculcation or indoctrination, this is *why* public schools exist - and everyone does have equal access. Unless you're suggesting that we forcibly compel...oh, wait, since the community sets the curriculum and attendance is mandatory...

You're trying to assure equal outcomes and that will *always* fail. The best we can do, all that we should try to do, is to make sure equal opportunity is available for all. The problem we're discussing isn't a lack of access, it's our tolerance of those who reject that access. 

This is what the melting pot was supposed to resolve, to blend cultures together so that we *all* could adopt the best of each other's heritage and discard the worst of our own. Today, however, in too many schools we've made diversity a goal and cultural appropriation and imposition anathema. We are, in a nutshell, getting exactly what we wished for.

From one perspective, it's fair to ask if big city schools actually are failing. That so many of them are not succeeding in teaching values that will lead to success is perhaps not accidental. Instead, it's the result of an intentional program that promotes failure under the guise of diversity and which warehouses the children of the underclass rather than inculcating and nurturing them in common values. It keeps the kids (relatively) safe during the day so that their parents can work and assures that those children will grow up to replace their parents as powerless and controllable citizens. 

It's no surprise that so many of the failed public schools are located in communities that are controlled by putative Progressives and operated by a teachers guild that exerts an economic and political hegemony over a school system that they have monopolized. Those are the problems that need to be addressed, not access.

I'm not sure how diversity is immediately relevant in talking about inner city schools (or most rural schools for that matter). The issue is very much access; these kids don't have access to much in their daily lives aside from grinding, generational poverty, which colors their educational experience by virtue of the natural consequences of a critical mass that overwhelms school resources. Ideally, these schools would feed them three meals a day, have therapists working with every student, and expansive after-school offerings, but the money is not there for that and probably can never be there for that. To talk of equality of opportunity in this context is ridiculous, which goes to my initial point. You can have inequality of opportunity without active discrimination.","2_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

Schools like Harvard only take a tiny sliver of the bulk of American students. These changes will impact maybe 5-10 students each year. Maybe fewer. But the affirmative action efforts they had prior to this only took a surface level approach. So maybe instead of having 250 white and Asian kids from rich families, they had 240 white and Asian kids from rich families, 10 black and Hispanic kids from rich families. 

This did nothing to materially change things. They still drew from the same pool of candidates except the affirmative action efforts gave them some slight skin color diversity. 

There is no poor kid from Chicago or rural Montana impacted by these affirmative action efforts.

Right now where I live a principal makes $120-150k and a lead attorney for a school district makes $200k+. That income is firmly in the upperclass. 

I get the yearning to be more diverse and to have our bodies (campuses, senate, police force, etc.) look like us. But what is the point if they all come from rich families? Who cares that Harvard isnt holding two slots for a rich black person and a rich Hispanic person.

At least the important thing here is that colleges are still allowed to consider the impact that race has on a student's life. The wording of some of the news coverage leaves that unclear. The big difference is the college wouldn't be considering the impact the student's race has on campus diversity. 

In other words, hopefully colleges still consider how racist the US is against black people and how that affect the lives of black students. And hopefully they don't consider that there are too many Asians, any more. At least that's my hope.","5_5"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/14m6o8b/supreme_court_rules_against_affirmative_action_in/","AltRumination","2023-06-29",1688058250,-5,-5,0,0,"You believe that colleges should accept less qualified students due to their skin color.  But, don't you think that dilutes the purpose of the college?

If you really think about it, college is merely a due-diligence test for employer.  Employers are assured that a Harvard graduate will have a certain level of intelligence and competency.  But, less-qualified graduates thwart this purpose and hurts society.  It also hurts minority graduates who *did* qualify on their merits rather than their skin color.

Can you tell me *why* minorities want to attend these colleges?

I can think of 2 main reasons.  First, they want to be associated with the rigor of these colleges.  If they get accepted into Harvard, to future employers, it means they are smart.  But, if this is the reason, it's a complete lie since they didn't get accepted due to their intelligence; they got accepted due to their skin color.

Second, they may want access to the higher-quality education that top colleges offer.  But, these higher-quality facilities were allocated for the brightest of our society.  For example, teachers flock to these institutions because they want to teach the brightest.  It's a misallocation of resources by focusing attention on people who aren't qualified to receive that education.

Don't get me wrong.  I do believe that *some* consideration should be given to the difficulties that a student had to face in order to learn.  But, that consideration should be offset by proof that the student works harder than other students.  In other words, after a few semesters, the less-qualified candidate will likely catch up to their peers.

Diversity across our society is important but it should be a secondary criterion.  Merit is, by far, more important.  For example, would you choose a surgeon to replace your heart based on his merit or his skin color?  What if you selected a surgeon because they graduated from Harvard Medical School?  And, what if it happens that this surgeon actually turned out to be terrible and only got into Harvard because of their skin color?

Or, consider Obama.  Due to affirmative action, he got a lot of grief because there were questions about his competency.  Did he get into Harvard because of his skin color?  There was no way to know.  I was hesitant to vote for him.

Affirmative action derails the efficiency of the system.  Resources are supposed to be allocated based on merit, not skin color.  Diversity is something we should consider when all factors of merit are equal.

\*By the way, they shouldn't only get rid of affirmative action.  They need to stop admitting students due to their celebrity or money.  George Bush and Yale.  Jared Kushner and Harvard.  It hurts our society when this occurs because it similarly misallocates resources.  People believe that Jared must be a genius but it's not true.  Jared's high school classmates say that he's an idiot.  They were shocked to learn that he got into Harvard.  He was initially rejected but then his father called the admissions office and made a donation.  It's funny but Jared's high school is called Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy.  I guess his father made a small donation there as well.","5_6"

First of all just letting you know that this is a pretty textbook argument used by people who dont want to see people of color climbing your precious ladder to success that youre trying to kick away. Im not going to do a strawman but just letting you know. 

Its interesting that you want peoples difficulties in life to be considered but you dont see how people of color are disproportionately subject to those difficulties. Why do you think AA began in the first place? 

Sotomayor made an important point. Its important that colleges include all people. The reason that people of color struggle often has to do with having unequal opportunities to access the kinds of things that white people more easily have access to. Hence they are less qualified (whatever that means) by no fault of their own. 

Affirmative action isnt perfect. To your point it sometimes means a more qualified white person is rejected for a less qualified person of color. But many folks of color got to where they are because of a college education. 

Im fortunate to live in a state that will keep fighting to ensure that people from marginalized backgrounds have access to higher education. This court ruling allows states to choose *not* to prioritize this without any way to legally compel them to do so.

Hence they are less qualified (whatever that means) by no fault of their own.

There is a great story of two school districts next to each other. One is like 90% black, the other 90% white. They have an exchange where a group of kids go to the other school for like a month. 

The number one shock to the white kids is the utter lack of computers in the classroom. Each classroom in the black school had only 1 computer, while the white student had like 10-20 per classroom. 

These are two schools in the same county and same state, but the money spent is vastly different due to how they raise funds for the local schools. 

&gt;To your point it sometimes means a more qualified white person is rejected for a less qualified person of color.

This is also a completely misunderstanding of AA. You cannot skip over a qualified candidate to hire a non-qualified candidate. What you can do is have two people who both qualify, so you pick the minority. But if you had 100% white people qualify, and 100% black qualify, you can pick a 100% white school. AA only kicks in when you are hiring someone not qualified over someone who is. 

Which, btw, is mainly done by HR reporting. Not the candidates, or bosses, it is HR being like, ""the bosses are skipping over good people to hire whites""","5_6_1_1"

I do think college admissions should consider ones background but it should be a minor consideration.  A students intelligence and competency are far more important.  Background should only come into play if the student shows tremendous drive and it is likely the student would catch up to their peers within a few semesters.  As you would expect, such students would only be slightly less competent than their counterparts.

I was initially a proponent of affirmative action when I first read about it 2 decades ago.  The Supreme Court ruled for affirmative action because a research study determined that people of color had excelled in their careers despite being less qualified than their counterparts in college.  When hearing this, I believed that these people had caught up.  I was all on board with affirmative action!  And, I gave it a chance.  I even would go out of my way to hire minorities who had the correct pedigree.  However, my anecdotal experience these past 20 years has convinced me that that study was wrong.  
  
Less-qualified people who get into top colleges may make just as much money as their peers but its a sham.  They may succeed due to their degree but they arent as competent as their peers.  Ive seen it countless times.  Ive experienced it directly as well.  Ive come to realize that affirmative action dilutes the meaning of that degree.  That degree means nothing when it doesnt stand for anything.

Consider Clarence Thomas.  Due to affirmative action, he's now on the Supreme Court.  So, his skin color helped him succeed but consider his legacy.  He's the most conservative out of the conservative judges.  He's the most corrupt.  And, his legal work is mediocre.

Now, consider Ketanji Brown Jackson.  I don't think she was the beneficiary of affirmative action.  She's probably the most qualified judge out of all the justices.  The quality of her work is superb.  But, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering if she got to where she is due to her skin color.  Consider these two examples, what does that say about affirmative action?

Finally, consider Stuyvesant High School.  For decades, admissions was determined solely by an entrance exam.  Last year, only 7 black and 20 Hispanic students were offered a spot out of 762.  So, recently, Mayor Blasio tried to get rid of this entrance exam.  He wanted to make it more fair and give 2/3 of the spots to black and Hispanic students.  Unfortunately, his proposal failed at the state level.  I said unfortunately because I think it would be a good case study illustrating why affirmative action doesnt work.  Just imagine what would have happened if he succeeded.  There would have been hundreds of students who would have been completely unprepared to compete with the other hundreds of students who were far more competent.  There would have also been a mass exodus of teachers who threatened to leave because they wanted to teach the brightest students.  Imagine how the reputation of the school would have been quickly destroyed; whenever you meet someone from Stuyvesant, you know that student has been taught well.  Do you agree with Blasio that diversity would have been the correct choice here?

I agree that diversity is important.  Its extremely important.  However, this isnt the way.  It completely derails and corrupts the system.  Corruption?  Yes, if you really think about it, affirmative action is corruption.  Corruption is when people, due to some outside factor like nepotism, end up with positions they arent qualified to be in.  This is what affirmative action is doing.  You are awarding people a title of competency when they arent.  Thats the real reason that people want to get into top colleges.  The degree gets you through doors because its supposed to tell people that the person is intelligent and competent.  But, with affirmative action, it becomes a lie.  
  
The answer isnt affirmative action because you're corrupting the entire system to benefit a few minorities.  The solution isnt also putting more resources into low-income areas.  That doesnt work either.  Mark Zuckerburg donated $200 MM to Newark school and the money just disappeared 5 years later.  Nobody stole it.  The system just swallowed it up and student grades didnt improve.  So, whats the solution?  Nobody wants to talk about the big elephant in the room.  The problem is culture.  Parents from certain ethnic groups simply do not emphasize education enough.  Thats it.  Its that simple.

I tutor kids from different backgrounds.  I can tell you that the true problem is the mentality of parents.  Parents in districts with better schools are psychotic about education.  They force their kids to go to learning centers and have private tutors.  Yes, money helps but it's not the overriding factor as you see Asian parents in low-income areas use their last dollar so their kids have extra sessions with a tutor.

I hope my little rant here will help you reconsider your stance.  I see most of the comments in this forum and it saddens me.  People are misguided here.

I know that, that was the point. The graph includes CalTech as a comparison group, where Asian enrollment increased roughly proportionally with overall enrollment. It could have also included Stanford, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, UCLA, etc and a similar upward slope in Asian enrollment would emerge. [Here](http://priceonomics.com/post/48794283011/do-elite-colleges-discriminate-against-asians) is a summary of the research on the subject.


&gt;This might be explained by the fact that population growth might be driven by new immigrants or southeast asians, two groups that tend to underperform. 

[Southeast &amp; Pacific Islanders are still a small percentage of Asian population in the US](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/asianamericans-graphics/smaller-groups/). All other evidence leads to the contrary: Asians have been increasing, not decreasing, in competitiveness. Just one example from the Priceonomics article: ""Asians were less than 10 percent of U.S. Math Olympiad winners during the 1980s, but rose to a striking 58 percent of the total during the last thirteen years 20002012."" Gonna go ahead and mark this:

&gt;Therefore the new asian applicants are not as competitive.

as completely untrue.


&gt; Despite being about 6% of the American population, the graph shows asian americans making up about 15% of ivy league student bodies.

And, like I said, Asians overperform the norm. If competitiveness were race-blind, Asians *should* be overrepresented in the samples, or at least rising in enrollment numbers. The downward slope in the Ivies is unexplained.","2_2_1_1_1_1"

If you read the article linked above, they are claiming that Harvard could still have very high standards and admit a similar proportion of minority students under a system of low-SES preferences. Recall that the University of Texas instituted a ban on the use of race/ethnicity and yet still has an incredibly diverse student body.  There's a lot of complications around this issue, but I think it's possible for elite schools to do without racial/ethnic discrimination. ","3_1"

This is indicative of the poorer quality of education in lower SES schools, among other factors. My suggestion is that by improving the quality of education in lower SES schools, and conditions that create concentrations of poor SES in the first place, there wouldnt have to be this kind of weighting in college admissions.

Richard Kahlenberg, the author of the article, [writes extensively on](https://tcf.org/experts/richard-d-kahlenberg/?session=1&amp;session=1) how we might achieve some of these goals. 

One of the most interesting points Ive come across as Ive been following this issue for the last several months, is the fact that one of the factors that impacts the rate of Asian students who apply vs. Asian student who are accepted to Harvard, is that their parents (mostly those in the Chinese American community) *make them* apply. This is in contrast to the data in Kahlenbergs report that suggests that there are many highly qualified students of other demographics (mostly Hispanic and African American) who do not even apply to highly competitive schools. It would be interesting to examine the variety of factors that prevent highly qualified lower SES students from applying in the first place.

Ive also found some relevant nuance about this issue by reading some conversation about it on the [Asian American subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9meo0b/the_rise_and_fall_of_affirmative_action/), if anyone is interested. 

While Kahlenberg seems reputable and sincere in his efforts to maintain ethnic/racial diversity and improve the overall quality of our education system for more *economically* diverse students, I cant help be extremely apprehensive and skeptical of the goals of the guy that hired him to produce this particular report. The Students for Fair Admissions, is basically just this guy [Edward Blum](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher) who seems to have an ax to grind because he lost a Congressional election in the 90s, which he attributed to gerrymandering that he claimed favored African Americans and Latinx voters. I worry that Kahlenberg may have taken up with Blum in a sort of devils bargain among people with goals that seem more similar on the surface, but are radically different once you do a bit of investigating. 

Blum helped bring the case that gutted the Voting Rights Act. This case against Harvard is just a vehicle to move toward a purely meritocratic system that would *bolster* existing ethnic and racial SES disparities. Blum isnt interested in remediating the conditions that underly the need for Affirmative Action policies, whether they are race/ethnicity based or SES based, or based on other factors. He just thinks that white people are being oppressed in the name of diversity. It wouldnt be the first time white men [used Asian people as pawns](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks) in their attempt to disenfranchise other minority populations.

Your own article you linked below disputes this claim:

*Besides, University lawyers argue, Harvard is already pursuing race-neutral programs that help achieve a diverse student body. Attorneys pointed to the schools generous financial aid program, its wide-ranging recruitment efforts, and its special consideration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, among other things.*

*Harvards efforts to promote diversity go far beyond its consideration of race in the admissions process, lawyers wrote in a June court filing.*

Also, see the [Harvard Financial Aid Initiative](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/hear-our-students/economic-diversity) started in 2004:

*This is simple: anyone can afford Harvard.*

*We have a long tradition of removing economic barriers for students who want to attend Harvard. Announced in 2004, The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) is a continuation of this tradition and greatly expands financial aid to families who earn less than $80,000. And, if your family earns less than $65,000 per year, your parents pay nothing for you to attend Harvard. It is simply our effort to make sure you and your family know you can afford to attend Harvard.*

*There is no special application or qualification necessaryjust apply for financial aid when you apply for admission. Applying for financial aid does not hinder your chances for admission.*","7_1_1"

Here's some quotes from the lawsuit yesterday, with SFFA lawyer Mortara questioning Harvard's Dean Khurana:

&gt;Dont you actually think that Harvards class should have a socioeconomic makeup that looks a lot more like America, provided the students were academically qualified to be at Harvard? Mortara asked Khurana. Your personal opinion, sir?

&gt;I dont, Khurana replied.

&gt;What is special about wealthy people that Harvard needs to have them overrepresented by a factor of six on its campus? Mortara asked later.

&gt;In response, Khurana said Mortara was missing the point.

From Alito's dissent in Fisher v. Texas:

&gt;On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument. UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority minority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the University would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11 345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit [t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas)

And he continues:
&gt;Moreover, although
UT reframes its argument, it continues to assert
that it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities.
For instance, UTs brief highlights its interest in
admitting [t]he black student with high grades from
Andover. Brief for Respondents 33. Similarly, at oral
argument, UT claimed that its interests in the educational
benefits of diversity would not be met if all of [the]
minority students were . . . coming from depressed socioeconomic
backgrounds.

You are moving the goalposts. Your original claim was that Harvard (and also UT from 2016) *dont care about socioeconomic diversity.* That is demostrably untrue, based on the initiaitives they have taken to seek out students from economically disadvantaged schools and areas. Do they still have more work they could do to improve admissions of highly qualified students from lower SES backgrounds? Most certainly! Heres an article from Harvard Magazine that takes a look at the issue, and discusses both the efforts and shortcomings toward [recruiting for more economic diversity](https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/08/admissions-office-strategies-low-income). 

Just because they dont set quotas for student diversity, whether it is related to race/ethnicity, or economics, or anything else, doesnt mean their admission process is devoid of efforts to attract and admit students from lower SES communities and schools. Just because they dont aim to have their student body be an exact reflection of the socio-economic breakdown of the country, doesnt mean they *dont care about* socio-economic diversity of inclusion.

One of the data points Richard Kahlenberg, who wrote the article posted by the OP, mentions in his report is that highly qualified students with lower SES who could gain admissions to highly competitive schools, apply to these schools at much lower rates than comparable students with higher SES. It would be good to examine why this is. Im sure there are things Harvard could do to improve recruitment among this pool of students, but my sense is that the reasons students dont apply are more complicated and are also related to other constraints people of lower SES have in general (travel expenses, need to contribute to household income, lack of savings, etc, etc.) 

Regardless, the question in the lawsuit isnt whether Harvard does the best it could at promoting economic diversity; it is whether considering factors like race/ethnicity should be permitted **at all**. Again, your own article is proof positive that it is necessary:

*Kahlenberg presented four variations of this admissions scenario Monday. All predicted an increased percentage of Asian-American admits. Three of the four scenarios led to increased Hispanic enrollment and decreased white enrollment.* **Every single one of the simulations predicted a decreased percentage of African-American admits.**

*But Harvard has its own experts.*

*Relying on analysis from University of California Economics Professor David E. Card, the University argued ahead of the trial that ending race-conscious admissions would severely drive down minority enrollment. Card, who was paid by Harvard for his work, projected that a* **race-blind admissions process would reduce the number of College students who identify as African-American, Hispanic, or Other by roughly 50 percent.**

Which brings us back to the main reason [Edward Blum brought this lawsuit in the first place](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher): it serves as a vehicle to disenfranchise African American and Lantix people in broader ways that serve his pro-white agenda.

If you really think Edward Blum gives a flying f**k about how many Asian people get into Harvard, then I have a bridge Id like to sell you. His main concern is reducing African American and Latinx access to representation in government, and jobs, and other spheres of life that he believes diminishes the power of the white majority. He is trying to establish legal precedent for the removal of race and ethnicity based Affirmative Action, that he can use to degrade protections for minoroties in other spheres of social and economic and governmental life.

Is that *reverse racism* youre talking about? Whats your username for your alt right account so we can all read your positions on this matter when you talk among your friends?

Remember folks, they are saying that the ACLU are the racists here. This is exactly what I am talking about when it comes to Blum. Read the articles I posted.

Here an excerpt:

&gt;After losing a congressional election in the early 1990s, Blum, who is white, challenged the Texas redistricting process as discriminating in favor of African-American and Latinx voters. While his success in that case, Bush v. Vera, was limited to particular districts, among his other challenges to the voting rights, Blum was behind Shelby v. Holder. That case gutted important protections in the Voting Rights Act with drastic effects for voters of color. His attacks on laws and policies designed to promote the equality of people of color are not limited to voting rights. Blum also crafted the unsuccessful challenge to race-conscious college admissions programs in Fisher v. University of Texas.

&gt;Failing in Fisher, Blum baldly strategized that he needed Asian plaintiffs. He formed Students for Fair Admissions as a vehicle to file litigation. The organizations leadership consists solely of Mr. Blum, Abagail Fisher, and Richard Fisher, her father. Through Students for Fair Admissions, Blum recruited members and filed his challenge to college admissions against Harvard with a twist. This time, Blum claims that the consideration of race discriminates against Asian-Americans.

&gt;While Blum now purports to represent the interests of Asian-Americans, none of his goals in litigation have changed. Blum isnt seeking to ensure that Harvard adequately addresses any implicit biases against Asian-Americans in its admissions practices, nor is he asking Harvard to take other affirmative steps to recognize the value of Asian-American applicants.

&gt;The relief Blum seeks is narrowly focused on what has always been his objective: a prohibition on any awareness of race in college admissions. If Blum gets his wish, statistical projections show that white applicants will be the primary beneficiaries. Not talking about race doesnt erase discrimination; it reinforces the privileges of white applicants by ignoring the ways in which deep-seeded structural racial inequality impacts individuals.

&gt;Blums cynical attempt to use members of the Asian-American community seeks to pit people of color against one another.","7_1_1_1_1_1_1"

It may be more reasonable to claim that the pool of applicants to Oxford is not representative of British demographics, and thus Oxford's population can only be representative through quotas. **But the problem is not in the quotas - it's the applicant pool.** If minority students are discouraged from applying to Oxford (systematically or programmatically) then Oxford would do well to engage more vigorously in outreach and prep programs - I hear they have good teachers, distinguished alumni, and plenty of money at Oxford, yeah?

We both agree that it's absurd that people who are looking for high-performing universities haven't heard of Oxford. You're right - it takes a 2-second google to figure out that, if you're a highly-qualified university-bound student, whatever your racial background, you definitely want to consider applying to Oxford.

I'm assuming that the demographics of people who do these 2-second google searches are representative, i.e. that students perform that search regardless of ethnicity. 

**Yet Oxford claims that they don't receive enough qualified minority applicants** (QMAs for short). Why is that? Logically, either: 

1. QMAs have never heard of Oxford, and thus don't apply... easy explanation, but as you noted, kind of absurd.
2. QMAs have heard of Oxford but don't apply because they don't think they can get it, can't afford it, or know/feel/intuit that they won't feel welcome because of their ethnicity.
3. QMAs have heard of Oxford and do apply, but don't get accepted because Oxford admissions are secretly a cabal of racists and bigots.

Only in case 1 is this situation not a problem for Oxford. But again, what's the likelihood that minority kids with stellar grades and amazing extracurriculars have never typed ""best universities in the world"" into Google?

Of course, you could sidestep this whole argument by claiming that demographic representativeness in institutional membership (especially in highly visible institutions like Oxford) in highly plural societies (like Great Britain) is not a more just or desirable goal than the status quo. That's a separate issue.

This was a joint venture between the two Institutional Research Boards of our schools, and I was just in on the discussion of the results.

There were no alternatives mentioned as to a replacement for the SAT. Moving away from research results to just my personal opinion, I think it will be difficult to design an assessment that will ever be superior to GPA in predicting college success. A test may be able to gauge preparation, and some might argue you can test for intelligence, but neither of those two is sufficient for college success.  Success in college, as defined by graduating GPA, obviously requires a minimum level of intellect, but it also requires perseverance, dedication, and, the ability to complete tasks that you do not always agree with, or understand the validity of. A simple exam can be gamed, and doesn't necessarily evaluate any of that (outside of preparation for that one exam). What better way to predict future success, then the authentic assessment of four years of classroom experience.

Really difficult to measure and define, but I think measuring high school GPA in relation to college degree completion rate misses the point. I'm sure if you went back in time and told the admissions guys at Harvard that Bill Gates would drop out, but he'd *also* become the wealthiest man in the world, they'd still accept him.","5_1_1_2"

I think there are a few problems using financial success as a metric for evaluating college success for the purposes of college acceptance. First, as you say, the data is much more difficult to obtain. But more than that, I'm not sure how valuable it is to the college itself (only with respect to admissions, I'll clarify where it is valuable down below). The college's main priority when selecting students is to choose students that will be successful in *their* programs. If a student is successful and graduates, it really shouldn't matter much to the college what the student chooses to pursue with that degree afterward. Given two identical students, I don't think the college should institutionalize preference for the student who they believe is more likely to work in industry over education, since the pay is better, for instance. Even given your example, in a perfect world, I'm not sure I agree that Bill Gates should have been accepted if they knew he would drop right out. He obviously didn't need the degree to pursue what he wanted, it hurt the college's graduation rate, took a spot from another student who may have actually benefited from the degree - and the only positive they get out of it is they can say Bill Gates spent some time on our campus. That's a rather self-serving reason.

All that said, of course financial success does play an important part in the overall evaluation of a college, I just think, in general, it's a better metric to evaluate entire programs with, not individual students. If I have a computer science program, and most of my graduates are earning well below the median, that likely says more about the training they are receiving within my program than it does about the individual student's high school preparation.

I don't think he necessarily *should* have, but I have no doubt he *would* have. Colleges, as institutions, love having their name attached to successful people. From a business perspective, colleges prefer financially successful graduates because they'll be more likely to donate as alumni. It's not a perfect system, but it's the way things work. 

That doesn't mean that we'll measure the success of a middle school teacher by their salary. But it means that the college would absolutely prefer to have a teacher-turned-entrepreneur in their graduating class than just a school teacher. It's a business decision, and colleges love to stick their brand on successful, high-profile grads because it pays the bills.","5_1_1_2_1_1"

The Hispanic and Latino population under 18 is 22.6&amp;#37; [according to 2016 Census data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/RHI725217#viewtop).  Ideally, it would be nice to break this down by the age range 18-25, but I don't see that statistic listed.","1_1_1"

Your vision of meritocracy, and CalTech's apparently, is a fraud at best. How can a nation move forward if institutions of higher education like CalTech only open their gates exclusively to those with privilege and power? That is why at world-class institutions like Yale and Stanford, we see affirmative action policies which take into account institutionalized racial inequities supported by a specifically and reliably concomitant socioeconomic disadvantage are rapidly growing racially and socioeconomically diverse populations.

The laser and the transistor were co-invented by Caltech alumni (Towns and Shockley).

When people talk about Socioeconomic status, it tends to mean a crapload of things that people generally understand it simply by income, but it's a fuckload more than just that.

Number of generations of siblings in college, mother/father's income, Free Reduced Lunch, Homelessness, the district they live in, school they went to, population density, disability, family job status, and everything you can even bear to imagine under the sun about your identity all used in an analysis to generate a profile of everything you are under the sun except race, can only explain a mere fraction.

Under the Diversity Lottery in SFUSD that used these factors, as many did in California post banned affirmative action in admissions, rapidly re-segregated the district in just a few short years. 

The court, disgusted by the failure of the decree to desegregate, decided after 30 years to allow the city to determine a better student assignment system, and that attempt allowed parents to choose a school anywhere in the district, and made it even worse.

This same fate also belies the University of California system, for the same above reasons, and more so with the problem of the SAT, which was proven in Court by Saul Geiser that the SAT discriminated against students of color as a poorer predictor than other socioeconomic metrics, and ever since its introduction into the UC system, was problematic over many administrations.

At the UC level, imagine all the socioeconomic things calculated to the best of the ability of the most renown minds of the California UC system, and absolutely failing to fix it.

Because nearly nothing can fix decades of housing and household tax policy that segregates schools by BOTH income and race.

Local household income funds local public schools, and if the neighborhood is poor, school might as well be a joke with people quitting by the week or month with how much they're paid.

And centuries of housing policy enforced it, and we haven't undone it.

The only way you're going to fix a race and socioeconomic problem is being able to ""see"" race and socioeconomic problems down to the student level. 

But seeing race by geographical level is allowed, which makes some difference, but limited depending on school district to school district to ineffective if it's so segregated that it's unsavable.

Think of anywhere where people in income and race live separately, like the suburbs and the city, all can easily fall into the unsavable category.

Even socialeconomic is limited, in SFUSD, the only one that really made a big difference was Free Reduced Lunch by individual.

By the time the kids get to the college level, they are already fucked by our housing and household income tax policies, super segregated by race and socialeconomic status, then a school assignment system with chockfull of loopholes and bullshit to make it doubly worse.","3_2"

For years (and not that long ago) women, and for longer, dark skinned folks (regardless of actual race) were literally barred from the education world altogether or were given intentionally worse education access.

The average white family in America has had several generations of high school or higher educated persons up to this point. That is not true for many people of color, meaning that some systems (explicitly but not only including legacy systems) still unintentionally benefit whites and/or males moreso.

Assuming that the pool of accepted students is at all representative of the people who apply, this means about 10,000 candidates of the class of 2025 should apply with a perfect Math SAT score (and about that much missed exactly 2 or so questions on the verbal).

94% of students are ranked in the top tenth of their high school classes and the the average GPA is 4.18.

Is it impossible, or even unlikely, for a typical URM student to fit this profile? Not at all, after all, they're competing with fairly mediocre wealthy trust fund kids, who presumably don't care if they go to Yale or Drexel instead. However, the problem is one of proportions. There simply are *vastly more* middle to upper class white and asian kids in the United States, and these students often are able to afford Kaplan and other resources to augment their studies, as well as avoid the factors that inhibit retention and learning in lower SES school districts.

As such, the deck is massively stacked against a URM for joining this rarified pool of 10,000 ""flawless SAT, GPA, Essay, and ECs + recommendations"" applicants. For every one of them who manage, there are 200 of the overrepresented students, being conservative, by definition (that's why they're overrepresented).

So the problem is not that admissions looking at merit would be a problem, it's that their current means of standardized merit assessment (SAT+GPA+EC's+Reccs) is completely invalid, inconsistent, and incoherent. Thus they need to rely on more holistic considerations, like campus life, student history and background, beliefs, and race and ethnicity.","2_1_3_1"

Let's look at NY for instance. In 2017 the mean and SD of SAT scores of [high school seniors](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_226.40.asp) in NY were 1052 and 188 respectively. Assuming a similar distribution in the 2021-2022 school year in the 67% of students that took the test (124,366[HS seniors](https://data.nysed.gov/enrollment.php?year=2022&amp;state=yes)), \~.18% of them should have scored above a 1600 (22,385 students).   


Of course, the SAT graders do not use a simple Z-score to normalize the test, the grading mechanisms are a lot more complex and weighted, but you can see pretty easily that a good portion score above 1600, whether this is actually reported to them, though, is as yet unknown as far as I understand. 

&gt;Same could be argued about Planned Parenthood. Doesn't mean we abolish the organization. It means we evaluate the utility outside of its original intention. And there is a significant body of academic literature on the utility of the SAT.

Planned Parenthood did not invent a form of abortion that does not work and kills the patient. Yerkes invented an intelligence test that is based on an IQ test which the creator (Binet) told him in writing does not work for measuring intelligence, but Yerkes decided to use it for that, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths (from a lack of URM doctors and scientists, and increased poverty and inequality). Recall that he did that by *designing the test* in a way that causes these outcomes, whereas planned parenthood did not actually intend to design *abortion* that way, since again, abortion was not invented by them. 

&gt;Plus, you're saying that organizations that were explicitly focusing on race in order to enroll more black and people of color (except Asians) are suddenly going to invert and try to keep blacks out by focusing on achievements and scholarship? That's a huge leap.

I mean, I'm certainly optimistic that Reed or Portland State University will have the sense to strengthen holistic admissions rather than weaken them, but places like Stanford, University of Sussex, Harvard, and UPenn, who have employed eugenicists as recently as a few months ago and whose faculty is 81% white? Not holding my breath. 

&gt;They do all of that now when you write essays and fill out background information. They frequently accept students that have slightly less overall scores but appear to show the intelligence and work ethic to succeed. And going forward they will do all of that except focusing on race and ethnicity.

What exactly do you think race and ethnicity are? It might be helpful to start there, since you seem to think they are divorced from how to interpret a student's upbringing. 

&gt;Out of curiosity, because you sound like someone I had a similar discussion with recently, do you feel that such backgrounds, race/ethnicity, opportunities (or lack thereof) should also be taken into account when evaluating academic performance once accepted into Harvard? That is, should a black student from a low income background with a father who died and a single mother working multiple jobs to keep her 3 kids fed (and thus no money for tutors or such), be granted a more generous grading curve in their classes than a white student from a 2 parent upper class background who had personal tutors?

Well you see at less barbaric universities, e.g. Brown University, there is a thing called ""pass fail grading"". It means there are two grades, pass and fail. The reason for that is that Brown scientists realized at around the same time McGraw Hill and Pearson did that grades and test scores do not actually tell you anything about a students academic performance, or their knowledge of subject matter, because it is mathematically impossible for them to since they are 2-3 digit numbers, and student knowledge cannot be encoded in 2-3 digits (if it could, your computer would not need 16 GB of RAM, it would only need about 1 MB of it). 

What they decided to do instead was what Binet did when he actually wanted to measure intelligence, as opposed to IQ (which is used for diagnosing things and studying cognition). He used an adaptive learning approach to analyze the difficulty of items and see how well students became proficient at them. 

This later became [Item Response Theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745011/) in the 50s and 60's, and the field of student modeling was born. The idea was to model student knowledge, learning, and retention using a graph or some other data structure, which more accurately tells you what they know and how they are thinking about it. 

This eventually led to the field of [cognitive architecture](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203780954/language-memory-thought-john-anderson) and something called [Knowledge Space Theory](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Knowledge-Space-Theory-Stahl-Meyer/045190623bf6e2ef99ec79d909302cf6e6ba5a50), which is what [ALEKS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022249621000134), a commonly used adaptive learning platform in colleges, uses to create a ""knowledge pie"" of what a student is proficient in. This is why brown university professors don't actually care what grade their students have, they can simply look at what areas they are proficient in as opposed to not, as well as how fast they are forgetting it. 

There are now deep learning approaches to student modeling that go even further, and use a student's actual body language or other characteristics to measure learning. [Squirrel AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHab0NvT8FQ) in China is at the forefront of this kind of modeling. The US is [slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2X4dIyaxxU) catching up to their insights into modeling thoughts.

This is part of why standardized tests are being fazed out. We knew around the 1980s that they were pretty useless and pointlessly causing negative outcomes, but they were fast and profitable for the same companies whose researchers *developed* many of the better ways, and it is hard to change a giant bureaucracy and explain to parents that the SAT they invested a bunch of time and money on taking themselves and helping their children prepare for is based on a bunch of made up justifications for treating URM soldiers like shit and trying to remove URMs from the gene pool. So they kind of ran with it until 2020 or so.","2_1_3_1_1_1"

It's always interesting how people complain about affirmative action much more than legacy.

That said, I am not sure how I feel about the overall idea of how academic 'merit' is measured. Clearly, legacy is pointless in that it only decides who to make exceptions for based on who you're born to. But things like recruiting athletes with lower merit statistics, as well as using affirmative action to admit more underrepresented minorities with less academic 'merit', or even legacy admits that may have lower qualifications (although it says in the article that most have higher qualifications)-- these people who are recruited likely aren't failing out of all of their classes or bringing the rest of the school down (I'm fairly certain some studies have shown aff action recipients often end up taking leadership roles, for what that's worth).

&gt;sports at elite schools are a quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids, and play a big role in keeping these institutions so stubbornly white

Harvard, Yale, Prinston are all around ~ 46% white. (Same applies to MIT, CalTech, Stanford and so on - all majority nonwhite). I am too lazy to look for links, but I have looked for these numbers recently since the topic came up here in another thread, so I am pretty sure of the numbers - all elite schools are well below 50%. While the US population is, what? 70%? I have no idea of the precise number, and I am not going to bother looking it up, but definitely over 50% white. 
  
In light of these numbers, the choice of words *so stubbrornly* in ""keeping these institutions so stubbornly white"" takes a very curious bend. They are not majority white, and the US population is, so who is being stubborn here, uh? And how would a regular/everyday Joe-type person react to the fact that whites are already underrepresented, but the Atlantic writers are still not satisfied and call those (already lower than their share of population) numbers ""stubborn""? 

I wish those ""new"" leftists / progressives / SJWs / grievance olympians would lay of their useless, divisive, deeply racist rhetoric.  ""Stubbornly white""! What on Earth? (/shakes head)

Anyway, college sports shouldn't take priority over academics. So absolutley, sports participation shouldn't have such a significant role in admissions. 

And race should have no place in consideration either - only merit. Then you wouldn't have this toxic ""stubborn"" haggling over who gets what share unfairly - whoever did the best work and whoever had the best achievement record, gets admitted. ","2"

One, almost all applicants to ivy leagues have perfect records, including grades, transcript, and SATs. So they have to look at other info. Otherwise the school would have to increase in size tenfold.

Two, achievement record assumes everyone had equal opportunity prior to college admissions. This is not the case.

FYI the reason that whites are ""underrepresented"" is they aren't as qualified as other ethnicities, especially Asian Americans (including Indian Americans).

The point of the article is that documents related to the Harvard lawsuit brought to light the fact that athletes and legacies had lower qualification requirements for admittance, and therefore took the spots of Asian Americans who were more qualified.

These policies that favor athletes and legacies advantage white applicants because they are more likely to be in those groups than Asian-Americans.

why over Asian American students? You are showing your bias. No. They discard perfect resumes from midwestern white all-staters with ACT 36 instead, when they enroll those marginally performing athletes. As a result, the white admit stats are pretty low (with all those less than bright legacies and athletes keeping the average down).   ","2_2_3_2_1_1_1"

What came to light so far in trial is that Harvard admitted to intentionally recruiting less qualified white students from ""sparse country"" (1310 PSAT) compared to Asian Americans (1380 PSAT) from other more diverse states.

Now that was just in recruitment, but it does seem to undercut the idea that athletes are predominantly taking the spots of qualified white students in the Midwest, as Harvard already has a system to try to recruit more white students from Midwestern states.

This isn't my bias. Asian Americans, as a demographic group, outperform white students in academic achievement. In 2015, 60% of students scoring 1500+ were Asian American, 33% were white.

In raw numbers, 53,000 Asian-Americans scored above 700, 48,000 whites. 30,000 Asian-Americans scored above 750, 16,000 whites.

Given this, the fact that Asian-Americans are 19% of the student body at Harvard and whites are 44% seems off.

Using SAT scores as an indicator of merit, one would expect white students to be 27% of the student population and Asian-American students to be 35%. I think I did the math correctly, it's late.

Even taking into account that SAT isn't the only measure of merit, the disconnect from the expected results slightly more Asian American students, and the actual results of more than twice as many white students is remarkable.","2_2_3_2_1_1_1_1"

yes it is. We are talking about the quota /affirmative action /diversity juggling here. Having the white enrollment targeted at that 46 percent, the ""athlete"" spots are being taken away from the qualified flyover states candidates.  

&gt;Using SAT scores as an indicator of merit, one would expect white students to be 27% of the student population and Asian-American students to be 35%. I think I did the math correctly, it's late.

yes,  it doesn't add up to 100? and you didn't include other groups.

Here's a fair analysis that I quoted here earlier:

Black -94%
Hispanic -82%

I mean if the logic is that the most qualified students should get in it shouldn't matter if they are poor either.

If they have lesser grades then they should go to lesser schools. All the arguments people make against affirmative action should still apply:

A. Students mismatched in school fit.

B. Higher achieving students losing spots to less qualified students. 

C. Certain groups disproportionately harmed relative to their actual competitive standing. 

I don't see how using wealth or lack thereof changes the gripes that people have especially since socio-economic status is often used as proxy for race anyway. 

If you are going to strive for egalitarian admissions process that people claim they want then do it for real. ","2_1"

I guess my concern is that if you ignore someone's background completely, students who could do well in college might be shut out of academic opportunities completely. The college admissions process weights a lot of factors that not everyone has an equal chance of doing: elite schools focus heavily on things like community service (poorer students often have to work for money and can't build houses in Haiti on Spring Break), legacy status, etc. Even state schools often focus heavily on things like AP courses (a lot of schools charge for things like that, so if you're poor you're less likely to even be able to take the exams even if you would have done well on them) and SAT/ACT testing (which again costs a lot of money and advantages richer students who can not only afford tutoring but can also afford to take the test over and over and only submit their best scores from each section). 

But I agree, if the goal is a 100% egalitarian admissions process then we should probably not have any form of affirmative action. However, if the goal is 100% egalitarian admissions process then we should strip away the holistic admissions criteria in their entirety -- not just affirmative action, but preferences for legacy admits, developmental preferences, and we should take a hard look at any aspect of the academic selection criteria that can be gamed by wealthier people. 

If a poor student can only afford to take the SAT once but a rich student can take it 5 times and mix and match their best scores, is that really 'fair'? The poor student's singular attempt might have been superior to all of the rich student's attempts, but the rich student gets to submit a better overall composite score solely because they were able to take the exam over and over.

It's a complicated system, and you make a great point above. I do think that if we are going to change it then we should also keep going about all of the inequities in the system instead of focusing *exclusively* on the parts that are specifically unfair to white students. ","2_1_1"

Actually, if you drop the affirmative action, the white demographic will remain unchanged, based on many statistical models. I can look up some papers if interested. 

The ultimate cruelty of affirmative action admissions is that it swaps the asian students that fell into the white-asian qualifications gap for the extra ""underrepresented"" minority students. The white share remains the same. ","3"

Affirmative action programs can be as benign as recruiting more minorities to apply... to as heavy-handed a mandating a quota. Most of the time it is framed as the latter even if that's not the particular way that institution does it. (Like the Texas case recently)

In reality, the supreme court has already neutered the original law with the 2007 and 2009 decisions that essentially held you can't use race qoutas to force diversity and you cant explicitly penalize another race because of poor perfromance from another. And many states like California, have banned it all together on their own.

When most people say they hate affirmative action. They really hate quota's. They don't hate the intention of creating more diversity.

This new 5-4 conservative court will probably not strike down affirmative action all together. They will likely just continue down the path they have been the last 20 years which is to slowly remove things from it they don't like. 

Me presonally, I want them to get rid of it. Because even if they neuter it to the point of 0 power... people of color will still have the stigma of being underqualified and affirmative action products in competetive arenas. ","4"

""Creamy layer"" is a term used in Indian politics to refer to the relatively wealthier and better educated members of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) who are not eligible for government sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the Sattanathan Commission in 1971, which directed that the ""creamy layer"" should be excluded from the reservations (quotas) of civil posts and services granted to the OBCs.

The creamy layer criteria was defined as Annual family income from all sources (excluding salaries &amp; income from agricultural land)more than 100,000 rupees (¹ or INR, together abbreviated Rs 1 lakh) per annum in 1993, and revised to ¹ 2.5 lakh (2004), then ¹ 4.5 lakh (2008), Rs 6 lakh (2013)and Rs 8 lakh (2017). In October 2015, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) proposed that a person belonging to OBC with an annual family income of up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as minimum ceiling for OBC. The NCBC also recommended the sub-division of OBCs into 'backward', 'more backward,' and 'extremely backward' blocs and divide 27% quota amongst them in proportion to their population, to ensure that stronger OBCs don't corner the quota benefits.

Both schools in the above example were weighted (grade inflation, if you prefer that term) on a 5.0 scale (assuming you took all AP classes) but some schools are only on a 4.0 scale, so a B in an advanced class is still a B where as a B in the former example was an A.  So if you don't take the advanced classes in a weighted school, you haven't a shot at being in the top 10% because you can't break the 4.0 barrier.  Or, if you're like me and take dual-credit classes that aren't weighted (only AP classes were weighted), then you're also fucked, though slightly less so as you're getting college credit at the same time (finished a semester of college in high school).  

Then there's the big school/small school problem.  Some of the larger schools will have a top 10% of 300.  Mine had a top 10% of 30.  Some schools have a top 10% of 1.  

Top 10% never fixed jack shit to do with racism except put a band aid on a gash.  I don't think race is as big of an issue as some would like you to think though.  You can still get in automatically via pure academic prowess at a lot of colleges (mine was either a 1300 SAT or 30 ACT for automatic admit if you were in the top 50% of your class).   Additionally, some colleges outright limit the number of people that can come in on Top 10% because else wise they'd just fill up with just Top 10ers, a lot of which don't deserve to be there at all, they just got lucky in where they were and then they fail out.  

Anyhow, just wanted to clear up some things as I've seen the Top 10% Rule spoken of in skewed lights before on the web.  I know, I know, ""someone's wrong on the internet?!""","1"

Even now, with refugees and immigrants from the Middle East and East Asia moving to Europe, there is not the intense system of school segregation, community segregation, racial disparities in funding, and lack of universal kindergarten.  

Why would a country that has universal healthcare, kindergarten, child care, and almost free university need to deal with the inequities that arise from not having those things?  
Moreover, feminist analyses of many European countries find they are much more gender equitable than the United States.  

Of course, this fails to account for the wide variety of countries in Europe. Portugal is extremely different than Norway. Same with the United Kingdom and Greece.

Now, it's early, so I may have missed something.  But that quote is the best thing I can decipher.  Essentially it says that black students do better on harder questions than white students, so weighting the harder questions heavier would increase test scores for blacks.  But this seems to point out that black students get the *easier* questions wrong.  So, to make up some wild conjecture, this is probably because the *average* black student is exposed less to an educated society and therefore does not learn many of the ""easy"" facts.

Because they're failing. Period. 

Simply put, the urban schools have been and are failing to achieve their primary goal - prepare the students for life as adults. They take your money and your children for little to no return. 

We know that education is one of the best ways to reduce poverty, it's also one of the primary reasons the public schools exist. Saying that poverty is why the kids can't be educated when that's the ostensible reason we mandate the schools is an admission of defeat. And unacceptable.

State funding formulas? The schools with the highest per student expenditures are some of the worst performing. New York city, for instance, with it's $28k per pupil budget, is a dismal underperformer. With NYC public school students trailing far behind the white student proficiency of 51.2% (the black student performance gap vs white is -15.9, Hispanic -15.5, AmerInd -12.1), believing that more money is going to fix the problem is a teacherthink fantasy. And unacceptable.

Police violence? To the extent that there is a problem with over-policing in many urban communities, I'm going to point out that the problem pales in comparison to black-on-black violence that doesn't seem to trouble the nattering Karens of the world very much. Certainly *violence* of any kind interferes with getting an education but, again, violence is one of the problems that public education was supposed to solve. Not achieving the goal of reducing violence means the schools failed. 

So why is school failure tolerated in our urban cores? It's the ""soft bigotry of low expectations"" - combined with the need of the wealthy to maintain government sponsored daycare to perpetuate an endless supply of underclass workers - in collusion with the teacher's guild who have come to understand that political muscle means they need not perform in order to keep their jobs.

If public education can't meet it's objectives - to prepare pupils for life as adults - then why are we, after generations of shyte performance, still requiring it? Remember, in the greater scope of history, public education is the experiment, not home schooling and not private schooling. With the very noble experiment that is urban public education failing so badly, the question must be what are we going to change to make it worthwhile?

I'm suggesting we start with the self-serving teacher's guilds and the pet politicians they elect, breaking up the education monopoly and giving the students, their parents and the community the power to force accountability and innovation at the expense of what has become effectively a sinecure for the teachers. Give the money to the students (especially the poor students who are least able to afford alternatives to PS000), not the teachers, and allow competition to motivate improvement and punish failure.

By the way, I'm speaking as a resident of Chicago, where the only way we can graduate more than half a cohort from high school is through a mandatory social promotion program (you can not fail a class so long as you show up and will be promoted, never mind demonstrating *any* proficiency in class), an intentional obfuscation of student performance data and an endless series of organized teacher and school cheating scandals. Where 79% of Chicago public school 8th graders are not grade-level proficient in reading and 80% are not grade level proficient in math.

I disagree. Monopolies *always* end up like the public schools - unjustifiably expensive, strongly resistant to change and too protective of the interests of the guild/owners at the expense of the public.

The only way to achieve the equity that you seek is by suppressing the high achievers despite their potential and by promoting the low achievers despite their lack of potential. That's not just unfair, it's stupid.

Even more ridiculously, the result of equity oriented programs is to hold *everyone* back. Denying a high potential kid a chance in the interest of achieving equal results while giving preferential treatment to a low potential kid means both kids and the society that is paying for public schools lose. When students and society lose because so-called equity programs systematically treat entire groups of children/people differently based upon prejudged notions of their ability based upon the tribal group they come from, it's called racism.

Unless you believe that urban blacks simply can't achieve, an attitude all too common among the teaching cadre. Believing that black urban students can't achieve because of poverty or culture or ethnicity *is* racist and so is accepting less than their best from a child because s/he isn't white. Maybe this is a place where the change can start - by insisting that teachers in urban schools *believe* in their students and stop condemning them to mediocrity (or worse) by treating them as second class people to be exploited. The soft bigotry of low expectations is a shitty reason that may explain unfair and unequal treatment but it certainly doesn't excuse it.

Capitalism has nothing to do with the performance of public schools, except for it's notable absence. The capitalists are the ones denied the opportunity to try to do better than the monopolist government schools and the people profiting from the urban school-to-prison pipeline are far more likely to be socialist/Marxist teachers and the medieval guilds they belong to than capitalist running dogs. It would be funny if it weren't so tragic that *everyone* in a socialist system wants to be an apparatchik - unless they've secured a position in the nomenklatura - and nobody wants to be one of the serfs.","3_1_1_1"

Goes back to ~1830 and the Common School movement. Though there had been a few public schools prior to this movement, the genesis of widespread government funded/mandated public schools in this country started with Horace Mann (*""education & is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance wheel of the social machinery""*) and a smallish group of Whig reformers. Very specifically, they believed that forced universal education would level the economic and social playing field across society by educating and inculcating it's most malleable members - the kids. That's a promise that too many urban schools are failing to honor. 

&gt; Do you think 12 shoddy years of education are worth less than child labor and no education?

Who says missing school means no education? The notion that children can only learn in school defies reason and history. Perhaps instead of wasting a decade or more of their lives in the craptastic daycare center that we call the urban public-school-to-prison-pipeline they would be better off learning a trade that will help improve their future and earning a little money that will help support their family. Or attending a charter school. Or being homeschooled.

I'm a believer in public education but it must be effective or it *should* die. My hope is to see public education, like the children and communities it is supposed to serve, reach it's potential and that doesn't appear to be possible without wresting control of it from the self-serving teacher's guilds and returning it to the broader community. In short, the experiment that is public education has all too often become corrupt and moribund, particularly in our lower class urban black communities. 

[This chart](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/stories/2021/03/homeschooling-on-the-rise-during-covid-19-pandemic-figure-1.jpg) is a harbinger of hope, though it should also give public school teachers the cold sweats. 

[1 out of 6 black children are now being home-schooled](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/03/homeschooling-on-the-rise-during-covid-19-pandemic.html) thanks to shit schools and the teachers selfish and irrational response to Covid. Pick your favorite metric and the homeschooled kids outperform their public school equivalents - and they do it in far less time each week and with far less drama. 

It doesn't really matter whether you believe the urban public school failure is caused by systemic racism or just plain self-serving stupidity in a government mandated monopoly environment, what does matter is that the long-standing and nearly complete failure of the urban public schools to deliver - to serve their communities instead of themselves and the clerisy that run them - is becoming a flashpoint that threatens to cause their communities to revolt and put an end to them. There's a tipping point somewhere out there, far below the 50% line, where public demand that education money flow to the student instead of the school is going to force the bad schools out of business - and we'll all be better off when it happens.","4_1_1_1"

Things like administration and office operations (which can make up a substantial portion of the budget) are necessary to run schools, but the exact number of assistant superintendents or the amount of paper the office uses isnt going to tell you much about the relative success of the students in question. You can easily have a city that, on paper, spends a great deal per student but does so wastefully and inefficiently, resulting in poor outcomes.

For example if IBM hired 10,000 new IT workers and the vast majority are white males.  This data would show a correlation of discrimination but would not necessarily be significant.  Turns out that people drawn to IT at the moment are mainly males,  white males particularly apply at an extremely high rate and study for IT credentials at a very high rate.  Getting female applicants is difficult as there is less interest in the field.  Does this mean females and minorities are being discriminated against... perhaps but perhaps not the numbers are not necessarily significant. 

Another example:  Increased diagnosis of Autism matches closely with increased TV and Screen time of children.  This correlation is interesting however does not mean TV/Screen time causes Autism.  It could?  But for now it is just an interesting correlation. 

So different rates of racial acceptance rate is interesting and can be useful data in supporting a case for discrimination but by itself is not significant.  Further creating a world where all identities are equally represented everywhere at all schools, jobs, etc is the essentially the plot line of most Dystopian novels (and for good reason).

Public schools were established to make sure that future generations of citizens are imbued with some basic common values and have the skills necessary to become productive members of society. In too many instances, we *are* failing to meet those objective.

Still, whether you call it conditioning or nurturing or inculcation or indoctrination, this is *why* public schools exist - and everyone does have equal access. Unless you're suggesting that we forcibly compel...oh, wait, since the community sets the curriculum and attendance is mandatory...

You're trying to assure equal outcomes and that will *always* fail. The best we can do, all that we should try to do, is to make sure equal opportunity is available for all. The problem we're discussing isn't a lack of access, it's our tolerance of those who reject that access. 

This is what the melting pot was supposed to resolve, to blend cultures together so that we *all* could adopt the best of each other's heritage and discard the worst of our own. Today, however, in too many schools we've made diversity a goal and cultural appropriation and imposition anathema. We are, in a nutshell, getting exactly what we wished for.

From one perspective, it's fair to ask if big city schools actually are failing. That so many of them are not succeeding in teaching values that will lead to success is perhaps not accidental. Instead, it's the result of an intentional program that promotes failure under the guise of diversity and which warehouses the children of the underclass rather than inculcating and nurturing them in common values. It keeps the kids (relatively) safe during the day so that their parents can work and assures that those children will grow up to replace their parents as powerless and controllable citizens. 

It's no surprise that so many of the failed public schools are located in communities that are controlled by putative Progressives and operated by a teachers guild that exerts an economic and political hegemony over a school system that they have monopolized. Those are the problems that need to be addressed, not access.

Schools like Harvard only take a tiny sliver of the bulk of American students. These changes will impact maybe 5-10 students each year. Maybe fewer. But the affirmative action efforts they had prior to this only took a surface level approach. So maybe instead of having 250 white and Asian kids from rich families, they had 240 white and Asian kids from rich families, 10 black and Hispanic kids from rich families. 

This did nothing to materially change things. They still drew from the same pool of candidates except the affirmative action efforts gave them some slight skin color diversity. 

There is no poor kid from Chicago or rural Montana impacted by these affirmative action efforts.

The real issue is that attending a school such as Harvard gives so much benefit to a person over any other school.

But, don't you think that dilutes the purpose of the college?

If you really think about it, college is merely a due-diligence test for employer.  Employers are assured that a Harvard graduate will have a certain level of intelligence and competency.  But, less-qualified graduates thwart this purpose and hurts society.  It also hurts minority graduates who *did* qualify on their merits rather than their skin color.

Can you tell me *why* minorities want to attend these colleges?

I can think of 2 main reasons.  First, they want to be associated with the rigor of these colleges.  If they get accepted into Harvard, to future employers, it means they are smart.  But, if this is the reason, it's a complete lie since they didn't get accepted due to their intelligence; they got accepted due to their skin color.

Second, they may want access to the higher-quality education that top colleges offer.  But, these higher-quality facilities were allocated for the brightest of our society.  For example, teachers flock to these institutions because they want to teach the brightest.  It's a misallocation of resources by focusing attention on people who aren't qualified to receive that education.

Don't get me wrong.  I do believe that *some* consideration should be given to the difficulties that a student had to face in order to learn.  But, that consideration should be offset by proof that the student works harder than other students.  In other words, after a few semesters, the less-qualified candidate will likely catch up to their peers.

Diversity across our society is important but it should be a secondary criterion.  Merit is, by far, more important.  For example, would you choose a surgeon to replace your heart based on his merit or his skin color?  What if you selected a surgeon because they graduated from Harvard Medical School?  And, what if it happens that this surgeon actually turned out to be terrible and only got into Harvard because of their skin color?

Or, consider Obama.  Due to affirmative action, he got a lot of grief because there were questions about his competency.  Did he get into Harvard because of his skin color?  There was no way to know.  I was hesitant to vote for him.

Affirmative action derails the efficiency of the system.  Resources are supposed to be allocated based on merit, not skin color.  Diversity is something we should consider when all factors of merit are equal.

\*By the way, they shouldn't only get rid of affirmative action.  They need to stop admitting students due to their celebrity or money.  George Bush and Yale.  Jared Kushner and Harvard.  It hurts our society when this occurs because it similarly misallocates resources.  People believe that Jared must be a genius but it's not true.  Jared's high school classmates say that he's an idiot.  They were shocked to learn that he got into Harvard.  He was initially rejected but then his father called the admissions office and made a donation.  It's funny but Jared's high school is called Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy.  I guess his father made a small donation there as well.","5_6"

Its interesting that you want peoples difficulties in life to be considered but you dont see how people of color are disproportionately subject to those difficulties. Why do you think AA began in the first place?

There is a great story of two school districts next to each other. One is like 90% black, the other 90% white. They have an exchange where a group of kids go to the other school for like a month. 

The number one shock to the white kids is the utter lack of computers in the classroom. Each classroom in the black school had only 1 computer, while the white student had like 10-20 per classroom. 

These are two schools in the same county and same state, but the money spent is vastly different due to how they raise funds for the local schools. 

&gt;To your point it sometimes means a more qualified white person is rejected for a less qualified person of color.

This is also a completely misunderstanding of AA. You cannot skip over a qualified candidate to hire a non-qualified candidate. What you can do is have two people who both qualify, so you pick the minority. But if you had 100% white people qualify, and 100% black qualify, you can pick a 100% white school. AA only kicks in when you are hiring someone not qualified over someone who is.

I do think college admissions should consider ones background but it should be a minor consideration.  A students intelligence and competency are far more important.  Background should only come into play if the student shows tremendous drive and it is likely the student would catch up to their peers within a few semesters.  As you would expect, such students would only be slightly less competent than their counterparts.

I was initially a proponent of affirmative action when I first read about it 2 decades ago.  The Supreme Court ruled for affirmative action because a research study determined that people of color had excelled in their careers despite being less qualified than their counterparts in college.  When hearing this, I believed that these people had caught up.  I was all on board with affirmative action!  And, I gave it a chance.  I even would go out of my way to hire minorities who had the correct pedigree.  However, my anecdotal experience these past 20 years has convinced me that that study was wrong.  
  
Less-qualified people who get into top colleges may make just as much money as their peers but its a sham.  They may succeed due to their degree but they arent as competent as their peers.  Ive seen it countless times.  Ive experienced it directly as well.  Ive come to realize that affirmative action dilutes the meaning of that degree.  That degree means nothing when it doesnt stand for anything.

Consider Clarence Thomas.  Due to affirmative action, he's now on the Supreme Court.  So, his skin color helped him succeed but consider his legacy.  He's the most conservative out of the conservative judges.  He's the most corrupt.  And, his legal work is mediocre.

Now, consider Ketanji Brown Jackson.  I don't think she was the beneficiary of affirmative action.  She's probably the most qualified judge out of all the justices.  The quality of her work is superb.  But, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering if she got to where she is due to her skin color.  Consider these two examples, what does that say about affirmative action?

Finally, consider Stuyvesant High School.  For decades, admissions was determined solely by an entrance exam.  Last year, only 7 black and 20 Hispanic students were offered a spot out of 762.  So, recently, Mayor Blasio tried to get rid of this entrance exam.  He wanted to make it more fair and give 2/3 of the spots to black and Hispanic students.  Unfortunately, his proposal failed at the state level.  I said unfortunately because I think it would be a good case study illustrating why affirmative action doesnt work.  Just imagine what would have happened if he succeeded.  There would have been hundreds of students who would have been completely unprepared to compete with the other hundreds of students who were far more competent.  There would have also been a mass exodus of teachers who threatened to leave because they wanted to teach the brightest students.  Imagine how the reputation of the school would have been quickly destroyed; whenever you meet someone from Stuyvesant, you know that student has been taught well.  Do you agree with Blasio that diversity would have been the correct choice here?

I agree that diversity is important.  Its extremely important.  However, this isnt the way.  It completely derails and corrupts the system.  Corruption?  Yes, if you really think about it, affirmative action is corruption.  Corruption is when people, due to some outside factor like nepotism, end up with positions they arent qualified to be in.  This is what affirmative action is doing.  You are awarding people a title of competency when they arent.  Thats the real reason that people want to get into top colleges.  The degree gets you through doors because its supposed to tell people that the person is intelligent and competent.  But, with affirmative action, it becomes a lie.  
  
The answer isnt affirmative action because you're corrupting the entire system to benefit a few minorities.  The solution isnt also putting more resources into low-income areas.  That doesnt work either.  Mark Zuckerburg donated $200 MM to Newark school and the money just disappeared 5 years later.  Nobody stole it.  The system just swallowed it up and student grades didnt improve.  So, whats the solution?  Nobody wants to talk about the big elephant in the room.  The problem is culture.  Parents from certain ethnic groups simply do not emphasize education enough.  Thats it.  Its that simple.

I tutor kids from different backgrounds.  I can tell you that the true problem is the mentality of parents.  Parents in districts with better schools are psychotic about education.  They force their kids to go to learning centers and have private tutors.  Yes, money helps but it's not the overriding factor as you see Asian parents in low-income areas use their last dollar so their kids have extra sessions with a tutor.

I hope my little rant here will help you reconsider your stance.  I see most of the comments in this forum and it saddens me.  People are misguided here.

The Supreme Court ruled for affirmative action because a research study determined that people of color had excelled in their careers despite being less qualified than their counterparts in college. When hearing this, I believed that these people had caught up. I was all on board with affirmative action! And, I gave it a chance. I even would go out of my way to hire minorities who had the correct pedigree. However, my anecdotal experience these past 20 years has convinced me that that study was wrong.  
  
Less-qualified people who get into top colleges may make just as much money as their peers (just as the study suggested) but its a sham. They may succeed due to their degree but they arent as competent as their peers. Ive seen it countless times. Ive experienced it directly as well. Ive come to realize that affirmative action dilutes the meaning of that degree. That degree means nothing when it doesnt stand for anything.  
  
Consider Clarence Thomas. Due to affirmative action, he's now on the Supreme Court. So, his skin color helped him succeed but consider his legacy. He's the most conservative out of the conservative judges. He's the most corrupt. And, his legal work is mediocre.  
  
Now, consider Ketanji Brown Jackson. I don't think she was the beneficiary of affirmative action. She's probably the most qualified judge out of all the justices. The quality of her work is superb. But, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering if she got to where she is due to her skin color. Consider these two examples, what does that say about affirmative action?  
  
Finally, consider Stuyvesant High School. For decades, admissions was determined solely by an entrance exam. Last year, only 7 black and 20 Hispanic students were offered a spot out of 762. So, recently, Mayor Blasio tried to get rid of this entrance exam. He wanted to make it more fair and give 2/3 of the spots to black and Hispanic students. Unfortunately, his proposal failed at the state level. I said unfortunately because I think it would be a good case study illustrating why affirmative action doesnt work. Just imagine what would have happened if he succeeded. There would have been hundreds of students who would have been completely unprepared to compete with the other hundreds of students who were far more competent. There would have also been a mass exodus of teachers who threatened to leave because they wanted to teach the brightest students. Imagine how the reputation of the school would have been quickly destroyed; whenever you meet someone from Stuyvesant, you know that student has been taught well. Do you agree with Blasio that diversity would have been the correct choice here?

It wouldn't surprise me that whites are more likely to get in to college with equal grades because whites tend to outperform blacks on standardized tests. So what the blog calls ""equally qualified"" isn't really equal.

You'd also want to consider that American public schools are very homogenous and majority black schools tend to be worse schools than majority white schools. So a student with a 3.8 from Greenwich High School is probably more competitive than a student with a 3.8 from a Title I school.","2_2_1"

I know that, that was the point. The graph includes CalTech as a comparison group, where Asian enrollment increased roughly proportionally with overall enrollment. It could have also included Stanford, UC Berkeley, University of Washington, UCLA, etc and a similar upward slope in Asian enrollment would emerge. [Here](http://priceonomics.com/post/48794283011/do-elite-colleges-discriminate-against-asians) is a summary of the research on the subject.


&gt;This might be explained by the fact that population growth might be driven by new immigrants or southeast asians, two groups that tend to underperform. 

[Southeast &amp; Pacific Islanders are still a small percentage of Asian population in the US](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/asianamericans-graphics/smaller-groups/). All other evidence leads to the contrary: Asians have been increasing, not decreasing, in competitiveness. Just one example from the Priceonomics article: ""Asians were less than 10 percent of U.S. Math Olympiad winners during the 1980s, but rose to a striking 58 percent of the total during the last thirteen years 20002012."" Gonna go ahead and mark this:

&gt;Therefore the new asian applicants are not as competitive.

as completely untrue.


&gt; Despite being about 6% of the American population, the graph shows asian americans making up about 15% of ivy league student bodies.

And, like I said, Asians overperform the norm. If competitiveness were race-blind, Asians *should* be overrepresented in the samples, or at least rising in enrollment numbers. The downward slope in the Ivies is unexplained.","2_2_1_1_1_1"

If you read the article linked above, they are claiming that Harvard could still have very high standards and admit a similar proportion of minority students under a system of low-SES preferences.

There's a lot of complications around this issue, but I think it's possible for elite schools to do without racial/ethnic discrimination. ","3_1"

This is indicative of the poorer quality of education in lower SES schools, among other factors. My suggestion is that by improving the quality of education in lower SES schools, and conditions that create concentrations of poor SES in the first place, there wouldnt have to be this kind of weighting in college admissions.

Richard Kahlenberg, the author of the article, [writes extensively on](https://tcf.org/experts/richard-d-kahlenberg/?session=1&amp;session=1) how we might achieve some of these goals. 

One of the most interesting points Ive come across as Ive been following this issue for the last several months, is the fact that one of the factors that impacts the rate of Asian students who apply vs. Asian student who are accepted to Harvard, is that their parents (mostly those in the Chinese American community) *make them* apply. This is in contrast to the data in Kahlenbergs report that suggests that there are many highly qualified students of other demographics (mostly Hispanic and African American) who do not even apply to highly competitive schools. It would be interesting to examine the variety of factors that prevent highly qualified lower SES students from applying in the first place.

Ive also found some relevant nuance about this issue by reading some conversation about it on the [Asian American subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9meo0b/the_rise_and_fall_of_affirmative_action/), if anyone is interested. 

While Kahlenberg seems reputable and sincere in his efforts to maintain ethnic/racial diversity and improve the overall quality of our education system for more *economically* diverse students, I cant help be extremely apprehensive and skeptical of the goals of the guy that hired him to produce this particular report. The Students for Fair Admissions, is basically just this guy [Edward Blum](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher) who seems to have an ax to grind because he lost a Congressional election in the 90s, which he attributed to gerrymandering that he claimed favored African Americans and Latinx voters. I worry that Kahlenberg may have taken up with Blum in a sort of devils bargain among people with goals that seem more similar on the surface, but are radically different once you do a bit of investigating. 

Blum helped bring the case that gutted the Voting Rights Act. This case against Harvard is just a vehicle to move toward a purely meritocratic system that would *bolster* existing ethnic and racial SES disparities. Blum isnt interested in remediating the conditions that underly the need for Affirmative Action policies, whether they are race/ethnicity based or SES based, or based on other factors. He just thinks that white people are being oppressed in the name of diversity. It wouldnt be the first time white men [used Asian people as pawns](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks) in their attempt to disenfranchise other minority populations.

Your own article you linked below disputes this claim:

*Besides, University lawyers argue, Harvard is already pursuing race-neutral programs that help achieve a diverse student body. Attorneys pointed to the schools generous financial aid program, its wide-ranging recruitment efforts, and its special consideration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, among other things.*

*Harvards efforts to promote diversity go far beyond its consideration of race in the admissions process, lawyers wrote in a June court filing.*

Also, see the [Harvard Financial Aid Initiative](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/hear-our-students/economic-diversity) started in 2004:

*This is simple: anyone can afford Harvard.*

*We have a long tradition of removing economic barriers for students who want to attend Harvard. Announced in 2004, The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) is a continuation of this tradition and greatly expands financial aid to families who earn less than $80,000. And, if your family earns less than $65,000 per year, your parents pay nothing for you to attend Harvard. It is simply our effort to make sure you and your family know you can afford to attend Harvard.*

*There is no special application or qualification necessaryjust apply for financial aid when you apply for admission. Applying for financial aid does not hinder your chances for admission.*","7_1_1"

Here's some quotes from the lawsuit yesterday, with SFFA lawyer Mortara questioning Harvard's Dean Khurana:

&gt;Dont you actually think that Harvards class should have a socioeconomic makeup that looks a lot more like America, provided the students were academically qualified to be at Harvard? Mortara asked Khurana. Your personal opinion, sir?

&gt;I dont, Khurana replied.

&gt;What is special about wealthy people that Harvard needs to have them overrepresented by a factor of six on its campus? Mortara asked later.

&gt;In response, Khurana said Mortara was missing the point.

&gt;Were not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States, Khurana said. What were trying to do is identify talent and make it possible for them to come to a place like Harvard.

From Alito's dissent in Fisher v. Texas:

&gt;On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument. UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority minority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the University would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11 345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit [t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas)

And he continues:
&gt;Moreover, although
UT reframes its argument, it continues to assert
that it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities.
For instance, UTs brief highlights its interest in
admitting [t]he black student with high grades from
Andover. Brief for Respondents 33. Similarly, at oral
argument, UT claimed that its interests in the educational
benefits of diversity would not be met if all of [the]
minority students were . . . coming from depressed socioeconomic
backgrounds.

You are moving the goalposts. Your original claim was that Harvard (and also UT from 2016) *dont care about socioeconomic diversity.* That is demostrably untrue, based on the initiaitives they have taken to seek out students from economically disadvantaged schools and areas. Do they still have more work they could do to improve admissions of highly qualified students from lower SES backgrounds? Most certainly! Heres an article from Harvard Magazine that takes a look at the issue, and discusses both the efforts and shortcomings toward [recruiting for more economic diversity](https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/08/admissions-office-strategies-low-income). 

Just because they dont set quotas for student diversity, whether it is related to race/ethnicity, or economics, or anything else, doesnt mean their admission process is devoid of efforts to attract and admit students from lower SES communities and schools. Just because they dont aim to have their student body be an exact reflection of the socio-economic breakdown of the country, doesnt mean they *dont care about* socio-economic diversity of inclusion.

One of the data points Richard Kahlenberg, who wrote the article posted by the OP, mentions in his report is that highly qualified students with lower SES who could gain admissions to highly competitive schools, apply to these schools at much lower rates than comparable students with higher SES. It would be good to examine why this is. Im sure there are things Harvard could do to improve recruitment among this pool of students, but my sense is that the reasons students dont apply are more complicated and are also related to other constraints people of lower SES have in general (travel expenses, need to contribute to household income, lack of savings, etc, etc.) 

Regardless, the question in the lawsuit isnt whether Harvard does the best it could at promoting economic diversity; it is whether considering factors like race/ethnicity should be permitted **at all**. Again, your own article is proof positive that it is necessary:

*Kahlenberg presented four variations of this admissions scenario Monday. All predicted an increased percentage of Asian-American admits. Three of the four scenarios led to increased Hispanic enrollment and decreased white enrollment.* **Every single one of the simulations predicted a decreased percentage of African-American admits.**

*But Harvard has its own experts.*

*Relying on analysis from University of California Economics Professor David E. Card, the University argued ahead of the trial that ending race-conscious admissions would severely drive down minority enrollment. Card, who was paid by Harvard for his work, projected that a* **race-blind admissions process would reduce the number of College students who identify as African-American, Hispanic, or Other by roughly 50 percent.**

Which brings us back to the main reason [Edward Blum brought this lawsuit in the first place](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher): it serves as a vehicle to disenfranchise African American and Lantix people in broader ways that serve his pro-white agenda.

If you really think Edward Blum gives a flying f**k about how many Asian people get into Harvard, then I have a bridge Id like to sell you. His main concern is reducing African American and Latinx access to representation in government, and jobs, and other spheres of life that he believes diminishes the power of the white majority. He is trying to establish legal precedent for the removal of race and ethnicity based Affirmative Action, that he can use to degrade protections for minoroties in other spheres of social and economic and governmental life.

Is that *reverse racism* youre talking about? Whats your username for your alt right account so we can all read your positions on this matter when you talk among your friends?

Remember folks, they are saying that the ACLU are the racists here. This is exactly what I am talking about when it comes to Blum. Read the articles I posted.

Here an excerpt:

&gt;After losing a congressional election in the early 1990s, Blum, who is white, challenged the Texas redistricting process as discriminating in favor of African-American and Latinx voters. While his success in that case, Bush v. Vera, was limited to particular districts, among his other challenges to the voting rights, Blum was behind Shelby v. Holder. That case gutted important protections in the Voting Rights Act with drastic effects for voters of color. His attacks on laws and policies designed to promote the equality of people of color are not limited to voting rights. Blum also crafted the unsuccessful challenge to race-conscious college admissions programs in Fisher v. University of Texas.

&gt;Failing in Fisher, Blum baldly strategized that he needed Asian plaintiffs. He formed Students for Fair Admissions as a vehicle to file litigation. The organizations leadership consists solely of Mr. Blum, Abagail Fisher, and Richard Fisher, her father. Through Students for Fair Admissions, Blum recruited members and filed his challenge to college admissions against Harvard with a twist. This time, Blum claims that the consideration of race discriminates against Asian-Americans.

&gt;While Blum now purports to represent the interests of Asian-Americans, none of his goals in litigation have changed. Blum isnt seeking to ensure that Harvard adequately addresses any implicit biases against Asian-Americans in its admissions practices, nor is he asking Harvard to take other affirmative steps to recognize the value of Asian-American applicants.

&gt;The relief Blum seeks is narrowly focused on what has always been his objective: a prohibition on any awareness of race in college admissions. If Blum gets his wish, statistical projections show that white applicants will be the primary beneficiaries. Not talking about race doesnt erase discrimination; it reinforces the privileges of white applicants by ignoring the ways in which deep-seeded structural racial inequality impacts individuals.

&gt;Blums cynical attempt to use members of the Asian-American community seeks to pit people of color against one another.","7_1_1_1_1_1_1"

It may be more reasonable to claim that the pool of applicants to Oxford is not representative of British demographics, and thus Oxford's population can only be representative through quotas. **But the problem is not in the quotas - it's the applicant pool.** If minority students are discouraged from applying to Oxford (systematically or programmatically) then Oxford would do well to engage more vigorously in outreach and prep programs - I hear they have good teachers, distinguished alumni, and plenty of money at Oxford, yeah?

We both agree that it's absurd that people who are looking for high-performing universities haven't heard of Oxford. You're right - it takes a 2-second google to figure out that, if you're a highly-qualified university-bound student, whatever your racial background, you definitely want to consider applying to Oxford.

I'm assuming that the demographics of people who do these 2-second google searches are representative, i.e. that students perform that search regardless of ethnicity. 

**Yet Oxford claims that they don't receive enough qualified minority applicants** (QMAs for short). Why is that? Logically, either: 

1. QMAs have never heard of Oxford, and thus don't apply... easy explanation, but as you noted, kind of absurd.
2. QMAs have heard of Oxford but don't apply because they don't think they can get it, can't afford it, or know/feel/intuit that they won't feel welcome because of their ethnicity.
3. QMAs have heard of Oxford and do apply, but don't get accepted because Oxford admissions are secretly a cabal of racists and bigots.

Only in case 1 is this situation not a problem for Oxford. But again, what's the likelihood that minority kids with stellar grades and amazing extracurriculars have never typed ""best universities in the world"" into Google?

Of course, you could sidestep this whole argument by claiming that demographic representativeness in institutional membership (especially in highly visible institutions like Oxford) in highly plural societies (like Great Britain) is not a more just or desirable goal than the status quo. That's a separate issue.

On top of that, having a top-notch university is not just about undergraduate education. Once you get into upper levels, students are contributing on research teams, doing projects that get published and advance collective knowledge. And some of them become professors. And so it goes.

edit: one more point, while I'm at it - Your implication that the people with lower grades coming in are going to be the weaker students is a huge assumption. The best students in university are the ones who aren't taking their education for granted, the ones who are self-motivated, open-minded and able to learn from their failures... this has a lot more to do with life experience than admissions standing.

There were no alternatives mentioned as to a replacement for the SAT. Moving away from research results to just my personal opinion, I think it will be difficult to design an assessment that will ever be superior to GPA in predicting college success. A test may be able to gauge preparation, and some might argue you can test for intelligence, but neither of those two is sufficient for college success.  Success in college, as defined by graduating GPA, obviously requires a minimum level of intellect, but it also requires perseverance, dedication, and, the ability to complete tasks that you do not always agree with, or understand the validity of. A simple exam can be gamed, and doesn't necessarily evaluate any of that (outside of preparation for that one exam). What better way to predict future success, then the authentic assessment of four years of classroom experience.

I think there are a few problems using financial success as a metric for evaluating college success for the purposes of college acceptance. First, as you say, the data is much more difficult to obtain. But more than that, I'm not sure how valuable it is to the college itself (only with respect to admissions, I'll clarify where it is valuable down below). The college's main priority when selecting students is to choose students that will be successful in *their* programs. If a student is successful and graduates, it really shouldn't matter much to the college what the student chooses to pursue with that degree afterward. Given two identical students, I don't think the college should institutionalize preference for the student who they believe is more likely to work in industry over education, since the pay is better, for instance. Even given your example, in a perfect world, I'm not sure I agree that Bill Gates should have been accepted if they knew he would drop right out. He obviously didn't need the degree to pursue what he wanted, it hurt the college's graduation rate, took a spot from another student who may have actually benefited from the degree - and the only positive they get out of it is they can say Bill Gates spent some time on our campus. That's a rather self-serving reason.

All that said, of course financial success does play an important part in the overall evaluation of a college, I just think, in general, it's a better metric to evaluate entire programs with, not individual students. If I have a computer science program, and most of my graduates are earning well below the median, that likely says more about the training they are receiving within my program than it does about the individual student's high school preparation.

I don't think he necessarily *should* have, but I have no doubt he *would* have. Colleges, as institutions, love having their name attached to successful people. From a business perspective, colleges prefer financially successful graduates because they'll be more likely to donate as alumni. It's not a perfect system, but it's the way things work. 

That doesn't mean that we'll measure the success of a middle school teacher by their salary. But it means that the college would absolutely prefer to have a teacher-turned-entrepreneur in their graduating class than just a school teacher. It's a business decision, and colleges love to stick their brand on successful, high-profile grads because it pays the bills.","5_1_1_2_1_1"

2. If the problem really exists, what if we also consider other disadvantages, like parents' highest education, lack of a parent, family income/asset per child etc, that we find relevant to academic performance?

I would support this measure. If we started giving financial aid based on parental income and net worth per child, it would stop incentivizing high IQ, educated, upper middle income married couples from having only one kid.

Poor Americans have plenty of kids. Billionaires like Elon Musk have plenty of kids. But something is seriously wrong when couples who make $150,000 a year can't afford to have more than one kid because they don't qualify for government help and they can't afford sticker price education for multiple kids like Elon Musk can.

When people talk about Socioeconomic status, it tends to mean a crapload of things that people generally understand it simply by income, but it's a fuckload more than just that.

Number of generations of siblings in college, mother/father's income, Free Reduced Lunch, Homelessness, the district they live in, school they went to, population density, disability, family job status, and everything you can even bear to imagine under the sun about your identity all used in an analysis to generate a profile of everything you are under the sun except race, can only explain a mere fraction.

Under the Diversity Lottery in SFUSD that used these factors, as many did in California post banned affirmative action in admissions, rapidly re-segregated the district in just a few short years. 

The court, disgusted by the failure of the decree to desegregate, decided after 30 years to allow the city to determine a better student assignment system, and that attempt allowed parents to choose a school anywhere in the district, and made it even worse.

This same fate also belies the University of California system, for the same above reasons, and more so with the problem of the SAT, which was proven in Court by Saul Geiser that the SAT discriminated against students of color as a poorer predictor than other socioeconomic metrics, and ever since its introduction into the UC system, was problematic over many administrations.

At the UC level, imagine all the socioeconomic things calculated to the best of the ability of the most renown minds of the California UC system, and absolutely failing to fix it.

Because nearly nothing can fix decades of housing and household tax policy that segregates schools by BOTH income and race.

Local household income funds local public schools, and if the neighborhood is poor, school might as well be a joke with people quitting by the week or month with how much they're paid.

And centuries of housing policy enforced it, and we haven't undone it.

The only way you're going to fix a race and socioeconomic problem is being able to ""see"" race and socioeconomic problems down to the student level. 

But seeing race by geographical level is allowed, which makes some difference, but limited depending on school district to school district to ineffective if it's so segregated that it's unsavable.

Think of anywhere where people in income and race live separately, like the suburbs and the city, all can easily fall into the unsavable category.

Even socialeconomic is limited, in SFUSD, the only one that really made a big difference was Free Reduced Lunch by individual.

By the time the kids get to the college level, they are already fucked by our housing and household income tax policies, super segregated by race and socialeconomic status, then a school assignment system with chockfull of loopholes and bullshit to make it doubly worse.","3_2"

For years (and not that long ago) women, and for longer, dark skinned folks (regardless of actual race) were literally barred from the education world altogether or were given intentionally worse education access. So just saying, ""hey we messed up, let's just not account for race or color at all anymore"" doesn't fix any problems, it just pretends they didn't have lingering effects. The average white family in America has had several generations of high school or higher educated persons up to this point. That is not true for many people of color, meaning that some systems (explicitly but not only including legacy systems) still unintentionally benefit whites and/or males moreso. I agree that there are downsides to affirmative action as it was in place, but in spirit, it's attempting to offset some of that discrimination, which in my opinion is better than nothing.

Assuming that the pool of accepted students is at all representative of the people who apply, this means about 10,000 candidates of the class of 2025 should apply with a perfect Math SAT score (and about that much missed exactly 2 or so questions on the verbal).

94% of students are ranked in the top tenth of their high school classes and the the average GPA is 4.18.

Is it impossible, or even unlikely, for a typical URM student to fit this profile? Not at all, after all, they're competing with fairly mediocre wealthy trust fund kids, who presumably don't care if they go to Yale or Drexel instead. However, the problem is one of proportions. There simply are *vastly more* middle to upper class white and asian kids in the United States, and these students often are able to afford Kaplan and other resources to augment their studies, as well as avoid the factors that inhibit retention and learning in lower SES school districts.

As such, the deck is massively stacked against a URM for joining this rarified pool of 10,000 ""flawless SAT, GPA, Essay, and ECs + recommendations"" applicants. For every one of them who manage, there are 200 of the overrepresented students, being conservative, by definition (that's why they're overrepresented).

So the problem is not that admissions looking at merit would be a problem, it's that their current means of standardized merit assessment (SAT+GPA+EC's+Reccs) is completely invalid, inconsistent, and incoherent.

Let's look at NY for instance. In 2017 the mean and SD of SAT scores of [high school seniors](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_226.40.asp) in NY were 1052 and 188 respectively. Assuming a similar distribution in the 2021-2022 school year in the 67% of students that took the test (124,366[HS seniors](https://data.nysed.gov/enrollment.php?year=2022&amp;state=yes)), \~.18% of them should have scored above a 1600 (22,385 students).   


Of course, the SAT graders do not use a simple Z-score to normalize the test, the grading mechanisms are a lot more complex and weighted, but you can see pretty easily that a good portion score above 1600, whether this is actually reported to them, though, is as yet unknown as far as I understand. 

&gt;Same could be argued about Planned Parenthood. Doesn't mean we abolish the organization. It means we evaluate the utility outside of its original intention. And there is a significant body of academic literature on the utility of the SAT.

Planned Parenthood did not invent a form of abortion that does not work and kills the patient. Yerkes invented an intelligence test that is based on an IQ test which the creator (Binet) told him in writing does not work for measuring intelligence, but Yerkes decided to use it for that, resulting in thousands of unnecessary deaths (from a lack of URM doctors and scientists, and increased poverty and inequality). Recall that he did that by *designing the test* in a way that causes these outcomes, whereas planned parenthood did not actually intend to design *abortion* that way, since again, abortion was not invented by them. 

&gt;Plus, you're saying that organizations that were explicitly focusing on race in order to enroll more black and people of color (except Asians) are suddenly going to invert and try to keep blacks out by focusing on achievements and scholarship? That's a huge leap.

I mean, I'm certainly optimistic that Reed or Portland State University will have the sense to strengthen holistic admissions rather than weaken them, but places like Stanford, University of Sussex, Harvard, and UPenn, who have employed eugenicists as recently as a few months ago and whose faculty is 81% white? Not holding my breath. 

&gt;They do all of that now when you write essays and fill out background information. They frequently accept students that have slightly less overall scores but appear to show the intelligence and work ethic to succeed. And going forward they will do all of that except focusing on race and ethnicity.

What exactly do you think race and ethnicity are? It might be helpful to start there, since you seem to think they are divorced from how to interpret a student's upbringing. 

&gt;Out of curiosity, because you sound like someone I had a similar discussion with recently, do you feel that such backgrounds, race/ethnicity, opportunities (or lack thereof) should also be taken into account when evaluating academic performance once accepted into Harvard? That is, should a black student from a low income background with a father who died and a single mother working multiple jobs to keep her 3 kids fed (and thus no money for tutors or such), be granted a more generous grading curve in their classes than a white student from a 2 parent upper class background who had personal tutors?

Well you see at less barbaric universities, e.g. Brown University, there is a thing called ""pass fail grading"". It means there are two grades, pass and fail. The reason for that is that Brown scientists realized at around the same time McGraw Hill and Pearson did that grades and test scores do not actually tell you anything about a students academic performance, or their knowledge of subject matter, because it is mathematically impossible for them to since they are 2-3 digit numbers, and student knowledge cannot be encoded in 2-3 digits (if it could, your computer would not need 16 GB of RAM, it would only need about 1 MB of it). 

What they decided to do instead was what Binet did when he actually wanted to measure intelligence, as opposed to IQ (which is used for diagnosing things and studying cognition). He used an adaptive learning approach to analyze the difficulty of items and see how well students became proficient at them. 

This later became [Item Response Theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6745011/) in the 50s and 60's, and the field of student modeling was born. The idea was to model student knowledge, learning, and retention using a graph or some other data structure, which more accurately tells you what they know and how they are thinking about it. 

This eventually led to the field of [cognitive architecture](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9780203780954/language-memory-thought-john-anderson) and something called [Knowledge Space Theory](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Knowledge-Space-Theory-Stahl-Meyer/045190623bf6e2ef99ec79d909302cf6e6ba5a50), which is what [ALEKS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022249621000134), a commonly used adaptive learning platform in colleges, uses to create a ""knowledge pie"" of what a student is proficient in. This is why brown university professors don't actually care what grade their students have, they can simply look at what areas they are proficient in as opposed to not, as well as how fast they are forgetting it. 

There are now deep learning approaches to student modeling that go even further, and use a student's actual body language or other characteristics to measure learning. [Squirrel AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHab0NvT8FQ) in China is at the forefront of this kind of modeling. The US is [slowly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2X4dIyaxxU) catching up to their insights into modeling thoughts.

This is part of why standardized tests are being fazed out. We knew around the 1980s that they were pretty useless and pointlessly causing negative outcomes, but they were fast and profitable for the same companies whose researchers *developed* many of the better ways, and it is hard to change a giant bureaucracy and explain to parents that the SAT they invested a bunch of time and money on taking themselves and helping their children prepare for is based on a bunch of made up justifications for treating URM soldiers like shit and trying to remove URMs from the gene pool. So they kind of ran with it until 2020 or so.","2_1_3_1_1_1"

Same could be argued about Planned Parenthood. Doesn't mean we abolish the organization. It means we evaluate the utility outside of its original intention. And there is a significant body of academic literature on the utility of the SAT.

Plus, you're saying that organizations that were explicitly focusing on race in order to enroll more black and people of color (except Asians) are suddenly going to invert and try to keep blacks out by focusing on achievements and scholarship? That's a huge leap.

&gt; another 25% scored 800 and above on the math

Um... **above** 800? citation needed.

&gt; Thus they need to rely on more holistic considerations, like campus life, student history and background, beliefs, and race and ethnicity.

They do all of that now when you write essays and fill out background information. They frequently accept students that have slightly less overall scores but appear to show the intelligence and work ethic to succeed. And going forward they will do all of that except focusing on race and ethnicity.

Out of curiosity, because you sound like someone I had a similar discussion with recently, do you feel that such backgrounds, race/ethnicity, opportunities (or lack thereof) should also be taken into account when evaluating academic performance once accepted into Harvard? That is, should a black student from a low income background with a father who died and a single mother working multiple jobs to keep her 3 kids fed (and thus no money for tutors or such), be granted a more generous grading curve in their classes than a white student from a 2 parent upper class background who had personal tutors?","2_1_3_1_2"

It's always interesting how people complain about affirmative action much more than legacy.

That said, I am not sure how I feel about the overall idea of how academic 'merit' is measured. Clearly, legacy is pointless in that it only decides who to make exceptions for based on who you're born to. But things like recruiting athletes with lower merit statistics, as well as using affirmative action to admit more underrepresented minorities with less academic 'merit', or even legacy admits that may have lower qualifications (although it says in the article that most have higher qualifications)-- these people who are recruited likely aren't failing out of all of their classes or bringing the rest of the school down (I'm fairly certain some studies have shown aff action recipients often end up taking leadership roles, for what that's worth).

&gt;sports at elite schools are a quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids, and play a big role in keeping these institutions so stubbornly white

Harvard, Yale, Prinston are all around ~ 46% white. (Same applies to MIT, CalTech, Stanford and so on - all majority nonwhite). I am too lazy to look for links, but I have looked for these numbers recently since the topic came up here in another thread, so I am pretty sure of the numbers - all elite schools are well below 50%. While the US population is, what? 70%? I have no idea of the precise number, and I am not going to bother looking it up, but definitely over 50% white. 
  
In light of these numbers, the choice of words *so stubbrornly* in ""keeping these institutions so stubbornly white"" takes a very curious bend. They are not majority white, and the US population is, so who is being stubborn here, uh? And how would a regular/everyday Joe-type person react to the fact that whites are already underrepresented, but the Atlantic writers are still not satisfied and call those (already lower than their share of population) numbers ""stubborn""?

Anyway, college sports shouldn't take priority over academics. So absolutley, sports participation shouldn't have such a significant role in admissions. 

And race should have no place in consideration either - only merit. Then you wouldn't have this toxic ""stubborn"" haggling over who gets what share unfairly - whoever did the best work and whoever had the best achievement record, gets admitted. ","2"

One, almost all applicants to ivy leagues have perfect records, including grades, transcript, and SATs. So they have to look at other info. Otherwise the school would have to increase in size tenfold.

Two, achievement record assumes everyone had equal opportunity prior to college admissions. This is not the case.

FYI the reason that whites are ""underrepresented"" is they aren't as qualified as other ethnicities, especially Asian Americans (including Indian Americans).

The point of the article is that documents related to the Harvard lawsuit brought to light the fact that athletes and legacies had lower qualification requirements for admittance, and therefore took the spots of Asian Americans who were more qualified.

These policies that favor athletes and legacies advantage white applicants because they are more likely to be in those groups than Asian-Americans.

why over Asian American students? You are showing your bias. No. They discard perfect resumes from midwestern white all-staters with ACT 36 instead, when they enroll those marginally performing athletes. As a result, the white admit stats are pretty low (with all those less than bright legacies and athletes keeping the average down).   ","2_2_3_2_1_1_1"

What came to light so far in trial is that Harvard admitted to intentionally recruiting less qualified white students from ""sparse country"" (1310 PSAT) compared to Asian Americans (1380 PSAT) from other more diverse states.

Now that was just in recruitment, but it does seem to undercut the idea that athletes are predominantly taking the spots of qualified white students in the Midwest, as Harvard already has a system to try to recruit more white students from Midwestern states.

This isn't my bias. Asian Americans, as a demographic group, outperform white students in academic achievement. In 2015, 60% of students scoring 1500+ were Asian American, 33% were white.

In raw numbers, 53,000 Asian-Americans scored above 700, 48,000 whites. 30,000 Asian-Americans scored above 750, 16,000 whites.

Given this, the fact that Asian-Americans are 19% of the student body at Harvard and whites are 44% seems off.

Using SAT scores as an indicator of merit, one would expect white students to be 27% of the student population and Asian-American students to be 35%. I think I did the math correctly, it's late.

Even taking into account that SAT isn't the only measure of merit, the disconnect from the expected results slightly more Asian American students, and the actual results of more than twice as many white students is remarkable.","2_2_3_2_1_1_1_1"

I mean if the logic is that the most qualified students should get in it shouldn't matter if they are poor either.

If they have lesser grades then they should go to lesser schools. All the arguments people make against affirmative action should still apply:

A. Students mismatched in school fit.

B. Higher achieving students losing spots to less qualified students. 

C. Certain groups disproportionately harmed relative to their actual competitive standing. 

I don't see how using wealth or lack thereof changes the gripes that people have especially since socio-economic status is often used as proxy for race anyway. 

If you are going to strive for egalitarian admissions process that people claim they want then do it for real. ","2_1"

I guess my concern is that if you ignore someone's background completely, students who could do well in college might be shut out of academic opportunities completely. The college admissions process weights a lot of factors that not everyone has an equal chance of doing: elite schools focus heavily on things like community service (poorer students often have to work for money and can't build houses in Haiti on Spring Break), legacy status, etc. Even state schools often focus heavily on things like AP courses (a lot of schools charge for things like that, so if you're poor you're less likely to even be able to take the exams even if you would have done well on them) and SAT/ACT testing (which again costs a lot of money and advantages richer students who can not only afford tutoring but can also afford to take the test over and over and only submit their best scores from each section). 

But I agree, if the goal is a 100% egalitarian admissions process then we should probably not have any form of affirmative action. However, if the goal is 100% egalitarian admissions process then we should strip away the holistic admissions criteria in their entirety -- not just affirmative action, but preferences for legacy admits, developmental preferences, and we should take a hard look at any aspect of the academic selection criteria that can be gamed by wealthier people. 

If a poor student can only afford to take the SAT once but a rich student can take it 5 times and mix and match their best scores, is that really 'fair'? The poor student's singular attempt might have been superior to all of the rich student's attempts, but the rich student gets to submit a better overall composite score solely because they were able to take the exam over and over.

It's a complicated system, and you make a great point above. I do think that if we are going to change it then we should also keep going about all of the inequities in the system instead of focusing *exclusively* on the parts that are specifically unfair to white students. ","2_1_1"

Actually, if you drop the affirmative action, the white demographic will remain unchanged, based on many statistical models. I can look up some papers if interested. 

The ultimate cruelty of affirmative action admissions is that it swaps the asian students that fell into the white-asian qualifications gap for the extra ""underrepresented"" minority students. The white share remains the same. ","3"

Affirmative action programs can be as benign as recruiting more minorities to apply... to as heavy-handed a mandating a quota. Most of the time it is framed as the latter even if that's not the particular way that institution does it. (Like the Texas case recently)

In reality, the supreme court has already neutered the original law with the 2007 and 2009 decisions that essentially held you can't use race qoutas to force diversity and you cant explicitly penalize another race because of poor perfromance from another. And many states like California, have banned it all together on their own.

When most people say they hate affirmative action. They really hate quota's. They don't hate the intention of creating more diversity.

This new 5-4 conservative court will probably not strike down affirmative action all together. They will likely just continue down the path they have been the last 20 years which is to slowly remove things from it they don't like. 

Me presonally, I want them to get rid of it. Because even if they neuter it to the point of 0 power... people of color will still have the stigma of being underqualified and affirmative action products in competetive arenas. ","4"

""Creamy layer"" is a term used in Indian politics to refer to the relatively wealthier and better educated members of the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) who are not eligible for government sponsored educational and professional benefit programs. The term was introduced by the Sattanathan Commission in 1971, which directed that the ""creamy layer"" should be excluded from the reservations (quotas) of civil posts and services granted to the OBCs.

The creamy layer criteria was defined as Annual family income from all sources (excluding salaries &amp; income from agricultural land)more than 100,000 rupees (¹ or INR, together abbreviated Rs 1 lakh) per annum in 1993, and revised to ¹ 2.5 lakh (2004), then ¹ 4.5 lakh (2008), Rs 6 lakh (2013)and Rs 8 lakh (2017). In October 2015, the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) proposed that a person belonging to OBC with an annual family income of up to Rs 15 lakh should be considered as minimum ceiling for OBC. The NCBC also recommended the sub-division of OBCs into 'backward', 'more backward,' and 'extremely backward' blocs and divide 27% quota amongst them in proportion to their population, to ensure that stronger OBCs don't corner the quota benefits.

The Top 10% rule is complete bullshit.  I can guarantee that the top 10% of my high school class was not on par with the top 10% of the high school down the road.  I had a 3.7 GPA in high school (not bragging - it's nothing to brag about - just illustrating) and was top 12% in my class.  Down the road, a 3.3 GPA got you into the top 10%.  It didn't really affect me as I got into the school I wanted without being top 10% but it's just one of the problems with the system. 

Additionally, some schools have weighted GPAs while others are straight up systems.  Both schools in the above example were weighted (grade inflation, if you prefer that term) on a 5.0 scale (assuming you took all AP classes) but some schools are only on a 4.0 scale, so a B in an advanced class is still a B where as a B in the former example was an A.  So if you don't take the advanced classes in a weighted school, you haven't a shot at being in the top 10% because you can't break the 4.0 barrier.  Or, if you're like me and take dual-credit classes that aren't weighted (only AP classes were weighted), then you're also fucked, though slightly less so as you're getting college credit at the same time (finished a semester of college in high school).  

Then there's the big school/small school problem.  Some of the larger schools will have a top 10% of 300.  Mine had a top 10% of 30.  Some schools have a top 10% of 1.  

Top 10% never fixed jack shit to do with racism except put a band aid on a gash.  I don't think race is as big of an issue as some would like you to think though.  You can still get in automatically via pure academic prowess at a lot of colleges (mine was either a 1300 SAT or 30 ACT for automatic admit if you were in the top 50% of your class).   Additionally, some colleges outright limit the number of people that can come in on Top 10% because else wise they'd just fill up with just Top 10ers, a lot of which don't deserve to be there at all, they just got lucky in where they were and then they fail out.  

Anyhow, just wanted to clear up some things as I've seen the Top 10% Rule spoken of in skewed lights before on the web.  I know, I know, ""someone's wrong on the internet?!""","1"

Why would a country that has universal healthcare, kindergarten, child care, and almost free university need to deal with the inequities that arise from not having those things?  
Moreover, feminist analyses of many European countries find they are much more gender equitable than the United States.  

Of course, this fails to account for the wide variety of countries in Europe. Portugal is extremely different than Norway. Same with the United Kingdom and Greece.

Even for other schools, there do exist such things as scholarships - including athletic scholarships which, as another NPR article noted, give preferential treatment to wealthier, whiter students (because a huge number of such scholarships are actually for sports like fencing, rowing, and lacrosse, even if sports like football and basketball get all the attention.)","1_2"

For years she had consistently found that most Asian Americans supported affirmative action, but in 2014, something **surprised her**: A fledgling network of politically savvy Asian Americans had derailed a Democrat-backed ballot initiative in California that wouldve rescinded the states long-standing ban on race-conscious admissions. These activists (...) had **materialized unexpectedly**, at least to Poon.

You have got to be kidding?! 

Just how clueless and unprofessional you have to be to not be aware of these sentiments? 

Jesus Christ, this issue (with discrimination against Asian Americans and the wide-spread resentment) was around since at least the late 90s. ","1"
