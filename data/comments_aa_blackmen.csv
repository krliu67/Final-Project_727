&gt;Fearless Fund was launched in 2019 by three prominent Black women - actress Keshia Knight Pulliam, entrepreneur Arian Simone and corporate executive Ayana Parsons - and counts as investors Bank of America, Costco Wholesale, General Mills, Mastercard,and JPMorgan Chase.

&gt;Arian Simone, CEO and co-founder of the Fearless Fund, said the fund has invested in more than 40 businesses over the past four years. She said it has deployed over $26.5 million in investments and awarded hundreds of grants that total more than $3 million.

&gt;The lawsuit centers on Fearless Fund's Fearless Strivers Grant Contest, which awards Black women who own small businesses $20,000 in grants, digital tools to help them grow their businesses and mentorship opportunities provided in conjunction with Mastercard.

&gt;Blum claims that approximately 60 members of his group, who are white and Asian American, have been excluded from the grant program due to their race. He also warned that the current lawsuit against the Fearless Fund is the first of many that he aims to pursue through his American Alliance for Equal Rights organization against private corporations.","3"

Depending on how you count it, only 20-30% of black people have any college experience. So the overwhelming majority of black people, particularly the poorest, were never able to directly benefit from Affirmative Action (theres of course the indirect benefit of more elite black lawyers civil rights lawyers and pro-black business black venture capitalists).","2"

People that complained about affirmative just choose to bury their heads in the sand about it because they feel better knowing their educational opportunities are back to being prioritized over others (especially certain white people, cuz they *passionately hate* being restricted to something that others are allowed to do).

Also just read a university is going to eliminate legacy admissions which could open up more spots for Black applicants. The dust is still settling. 

One concern to me though is how this has opened the flood gates. The architect behind the decision to strike down AA, Edward Blum, is now going after companies with diversity programs. Black women make up 0.35 percent of funding from Venture Capital firms. A group of Black women got together and formed a group to try and get Black women funding. Edward Blum is suing them now.

This won't go away. Because its cultural to presume Black people in a space, need a qualifier. Meaning, standing around means you might be loitering, and not simply waiting for something in the minds of racists and American culture. The ideas of *this one does not belong* or *let me make sure this one belongs* will not go away.

But to the broader question.

I don't think good things will come about it until primary education is funded equitably and legacy admissions eliminated at college and university level. Because it's all systematic, changing one thing usually means something else also has to change to reach a desired outcome.","8"

The actual problem is *drained pool politics.* The problem was less desegregation and more what the majority yt population did once it was instituted. The reaction to desegregation was/is a problem, not desegregation in itself.

This is easy to see, because looking at how schools are funded, all that needs to happen is schools being funded both *more* in the aggregate, but also equitably. Whether nearby houses are valued at $200k or $1.8m should not have bearing on the quality of the school zoned for those neighborhoods. This is an example of how desegregation is not the issue, but the other policies put in place or maintained in response to it.

To me, the irony is that it's the racists that champion policies and political outcomes that leave schools in poor or black neighborhoods in bad shape, but having bad schools is what makes some Black families want their kids to go to these white schools *in the first place*. What's interesting to me is that if I were racist, I would just not  want you near me Â so I'd opt for you to have your own good school, so you stay where you are and don't come to *my school*. But I realize that framing doesn't hold up to our racist culture because I didn't consider *hate* as a vector in my original analogy. The reason the racist wants to both ""keep their school"" and leave other schools in shambles is because they hate us, and want to hurt us. There's a brutality mechanism to it and desire to maim.","8_1_1"

Well still be diversity hires or diversity admissions, or whatever else they can pull together to dogwhistle that they assume were less-than. 

Meanwhile, the actual (&amp; I imagine marginal) impact itll have on usdecreasing the number of completely qualified students that successfully matriculate to the schools their white &amp; Asian counterparts more readily accesswill only hurt us, though not by any incredible stretch since the same or maybe even greater demand for tokens will continue to exist in the workforce. In the midst of this debate, everyone forgot that diversity is a market demand which affirmative action formed to help the government meet, and even if you unconstitutional the aid away, you cant unconstitutional the demand itself.
