In fact, affirmative action in college admissions can do more harm than good by piling debt on black and Hispanic students who have several times the non-completion rate of white students.  For example, [black students accumulate student debt 3 times as fast as white students at all types of institutions](https://www.brookings.edu/research/race-student-debt-and-for-profit-graduate-schools/).  Part of this is because the supreme court's position is that affirmative action can be used to benefit institutions, but not intentionally favor one race over another.

In other words, it's legal to use affirmative action to admit minorities so that white students get the benefit of a diverse student body, but it is illegal to use affirmative action to try to help historically disadvantaged groups move up the socio-economic ladder by favoring them over white students.  Of course it doesn't really work this way, but that's the legal reasoning.  

That said, many politicians who oppose affirmative action are not interested in doing the work the correct the deeper systemic problems like primary school funding.  Charter schools are actually popular with under-served communities and can work, but poorly regulated charter schools just drain money from public schools and provide inferior education so the extremist policies like in Arizona or like proposed by DeVos are also bad policy.  This is an area where I think even Democrats could and should do better, but Republicans are actively trying to do harm so we're not able to move forward.  ","2"

I don't think it's a coincidence that they now want to shift the topics of discussion to affirmative action, transgender rights, and immigration.

We should be careful about letting them control the narrative.  I fear that the more we get sucked into defending affirmative action, a divisive practice that only affects a tiny percentage of the population (really, how many people apply to Ivy League schools) and isn't even the product of legislation, the harder it will be for us to promote the Better Deal platform and other issues that have mass appeal, like healthcare reform.  

Note that Sessions hasn't actually done anything yet, just like Trump's tweet about banning trans people from the military didn't change the military's policy.  They are all talk and no action at this point, but the more they can shift the discussion away from their unpopular healthcare ideas and the Russia investigation and towards racial/nativist/evangelical identity politics, the less demoralized their base will be.
