"Forget about Affirmative Action, eliminating SAT scores is what will bring equality and boost black student enrollment in higher education","2022-02-03",1643917108,"Forget about Affirmative Action, eliminating SAT scores is what will bring equality and boost black student enrollment in higher education","The conservative Supreme court is likely to outlaw Affirmative action soon,  but behind the scenes, activists have been pushing for other methods to boost minority enrollment in colleges. SAT and ACT have been thought to favor rich students and give them a leg up in the college admission process. Test preps, academic support, ability to redo the SAT many times are some privileges enjoyed by wealthier students. 
 California State University has now permanently stopped using standardized SAT scores for admissions across all its campuses. More than two thirds of colleges in the US including Harvard have paused the  use of SAT. This has increased the number of black student admitted already. 

Colleges that have already axed the SATs are seeing more diversity. For example, 
Temple University student of color community grew to 45%up from 42% just a year ago and 39% the year before that. Both Black and Latinx students were admitted in record numbers.

My feeling is that even if they outlaw Affirmative Acton, and I think they will, we will be alright. The deck is stuck against us but black folk are never asleep at the switch. We already saw the inevitable end of Affirmative Action and started fighting for other ways to help ourselves. California State University had to be sued for discrimination which led to them axing the unfair standardized tests. I think once Affirmative Action is overturned by this conservative Supreme court, colleges will permanently stop using SAT, ACT for admissions.","blackladies",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/sjs5qi/forget_about_affirmative_action_eliminating_sat/"

"Defeating ignorant people with their own facts is a different kind of satisfaction","2020-07-02",1593667296,"Defeating ignorant people with their own facts is a different kind of satisfaction","Yesterday I uploaded a youtube video about anti-black racism and discrimination my sister and I have experienced and I guess it pissed of some really ignorant people. The comment thread is kinda long so I'll just copy and paste it instead of inserting screenshots. Am I tripping or do all these statistics and articles he keeps mentioning have nothing to do with proving that white people are marginalized? Like just because minority populations are increasing in the West doesn't mean that white people are becoming marginalized...

Angry Guy:  No worries, soon Whites will be so marginalized that they may as well be extinct. And then there will be no more racism or hate, amirite?

Me:  Can you explain to me how white people are marginalized? 

Angry Guy:  That report from the United Nations Population Division explained it. Here's a current example from south of the border.  [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/21/u-s-counties-majority-nonwhite/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgwSZf8b53hGUy4yMNR4AaABAg.9AaOcuBJaAn9AaSDOYnSnl&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXd0c0JlWkNvWmZCUkpHYm5QR3Zpc1o4X2p0d3xBQ3Jtc0ttYWdyUlRWM01YMVhkNEk3b1VSbzFQdmRSWk5TLVVHenktYmRWNGpUR3NPT1NUY2Y5ZmVtanFvelFvY3BBRzg5OE14ZndXWXNRdGRUdGJkWUxxTWcyeFZLdmcyUnNkV1lIRW1haVBHUkpfRzlBZTl4OA%3D%3D&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Ffact-tank%2F2019%2F08%2F21%2Fu-s-counties-majority-nonwhite%2F&amp;html_redirect=1&amp;event=comments) I suspect that's why people in the Identity Politics industry are starting to use a new term called ""racialized"" instead of ""minorities."". 

Me:  First of all, the article is about is the shifting demographics in the USA. The article suggests that white people are no longer the majority in various counties. However, if you pay close attention to the wording used, they were comparing white demographics to nonwhite demographics. This means that they lumped all minority populations (black, east asian, south asian, hispanic, middle eastern, etc.) within a county together and compared it to the population of one single race (white). The majority race in the counties mentioned may be (and probably are) still white, but when compared to the ENTIRE nonwhite population they are seen as the minority.  Second of all, marginalization is ""(of a person, group, or concept) treated as insignificant or peripheral."" This article only touches upon the changing demographics of the USA and does not explain how white people are being treated as insignificant in society. Minority is not synonymous with marginalized. Although minority groups are often marginalized, this does not automatically mean that every single minority group will face marginalization. Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority, can you give me an example of how white people are being marginalized? If you are a white person yourself, perhaps you could give me an example of how you have been marginalized in the past? 

Angry Guy:  "" Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority"" I didn't say anything. I merely quoted a U.N. demographic report.   "" give me an example of how white people are being marginalized?"" Again, that U.N. report is a forecast. A forecast that they have already had to projects upwards, There will be no population plateau or stabilization. It will continue to grow exponentially.  If 10% of the global population isn't a minority, I don't know whats is.  And that 10% includes non-Whites already living in the West, which is why I included that Pew research report.  Oh btw, I'm a Native living on a Indian reserve. Go ahead, ask me anything. I just tell it like it is.

Me:  Lol I'll ask again can you give me an example of how white people are treated as insignificant in society since you believe that they are marginalized? The article clearly has nothing to do with marginalization.  Also, in regards to when you said ""and then there will be no more racism or hate, amirite?"" If you had watched the whole video you would know that we talked about colourism and receiving hate within our race. We addressed the fact that there is work to be done within our own community as well and never claimed that all racism and hate comes from white people. 

Angry Guy:  I'll point out once again that the U.N. report I quoted is a \*forecast\*, something soon to be. So ask me in 2050 how White people will be marginalized.

Me:  I don't think you understand that being the minority is not the same as being marginalized. No where in the UN report does it say that white people will be marginalized. Where is the assumption that white people will be marginalized coming from because you're evidence has nothing to do with marginalization. 

Angry Guy:  No, of course the U.N. would make no such admission, lol. It's simple math really. The White population, and by White I mean Europeans and their descendants, aka ""the West"",  has been in steady decline since the 1960's and the advent of Feminism and ""the Pill"". Countries where Feminism has no inroad have seen their populations explode. Sadly, in many nations females have no say over their bodies. It's their parents who decide who they marry and how many babies to have. Sad.   So, it's just a matter of time before Whites are about rare as unicorns. 

Me:  I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall so I'm disengaging from this conversation.","blackladies",4,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/hjqzhn/defeating_ignorant_people_with_their_own_facts_is/"
"Imposter Syndrome Kicking In","2023-08-11",1691724088,"Imposter Syndrome Kicking In","Hello my beautiful melanin queens! So, after 9 months of waiting, I have finally been accepted as a transfer to my dream law school. Its a T-20 school, so its very prestigious. 

The first school I went to was completely traumatizing. Ive dealt with overt discrimination my entire life, but this school was wild. All of the black law studentsdeeplydepressed. The white law students made it clear we werent welcomed. One of the professors even sued the law school for trying to implement diversity and inclusion *and he won*!

Anyone, so the school I will be attending this fall is truly nothing like that. Ive been on the campus quite a bit and met with various deans and admissions reps. The students are all smiling, admissions are all extremely helpful and kind. Like if Hallmark made a law school, itd be this place lol

So, whats the problem right? I come from a low income background and have always been made to feel inadequate academically (I didnt know until my 3rd year of college that I have ADHD and dyslexia). Majority of these students at my new school come from wealthy backgrounds. Like, their parents pay for their $65K a year tuition out of pocket. Idky, but Im equal parts excited and ready, but terrified and overwhelmed. The admissions committee and scholarship committee have high expectations of my performance during and post law school. 

I worked really hard and worked up to such a big moment and now idk how to feel. I mentally prepared myself for if I got rejected, but wasnt prepared for getting accepted lol. Has anyone else had a similar experience, and/or general advice on how to even process this next big step in my life?>t=O<ý","blackladies",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/15nxayb/imposter_syndrome_kicking_in/"
