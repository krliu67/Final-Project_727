Even after serving their time, they have to put whether or not theyve been to prison in job apps, have reduced rights, and others. I just think that once you have served your time, that should be the end of it. You should have all of your rights restored and shouldnt have to tell anyone including employers that you were a convicted felon. This would probably bring down the recidivism rate.","1_1"

Yes, among african americans this rate is the highest. However the modern day culture does not largely view out of wedlock births as the stigma it once was. Out of wedlock births *are* a result of irresponsibility, *but* they are by and large *not* carried out on purpose. Rather, unplanned pregnancies are generally accidents.

Additionally, the vast majority of african americans are working people. I dont know why so many people on here constantly correlate welfare with african americans. Most african americans are not on welfare, and among those that do receive government assistance, the majority of those folks are the working poor. 

You mention how most african americans do not try to improve their lives and how most do not go to college. Many conservatives tend to have this sentiment. If that is the case in your opinion, then why are so many threatened by affirmative action? After all, if we are so lazy and dont work, then that would mean hardly any of us would be benefiting from affirmative action anyways, right?

I think the problem is that many people do not know african americans personally and form their opinion on what they see on television. Therein lies one of the problems.","22_2_2"

Single parent households disproportionately contribute criminals. About 1/4 of all African Americans are on Food Stamps, so around 10 million people, I would say thats a big number.

What do you mean threatened by Affirmative Action, the fact is that in a population of 40 million, some will obviously benefit, but the vast majority of African Americans dont go to college, and the ones that do (on Affirmative Action) essentially take someone elses spot.

Affirmative Action literally states that the color of you skin determines the value of your hard work, how valuable you are is a factor of not your talents, but how many colors a college can show on their brochure. The people benefiting from it today rely on the mistreatment of their ancestors to sidestep real requirements, and ultimately reduce the standards of all colleges.","22_2_2_1"

I think a major problem with ""slavery ending 140 years ago, segregation nearly 60 years ago"" is you are ignoring that generational wealth is a thing.  60 years means that a grandparent wasn't given the same education and opportunity which then translates to their kids not having the same opportunity.  When most black people's grandparents lived through segregation and then had nothing for their kids, the generations after will take a while to catch up to other races that did not have that setback.  That does not mean that there are no poor white people in the U.S. or that it is somehow the fault of a white person today.  It just means that when a country has set up so many roadblocks for a group of people, you can't just remove the roadblock and say all is fair.

Just an fyi, I am someone who believes that if extra opportunities are to be given, it should be given based on the kid's families income and not race based.  However, that doesn't mean that I don't believe that African Americans have not suffered in America through history.","22_2_3"

I think one problem is how its being presented. The way its being talked about makes it sound like parents and grandparents are writing large checks that give the younger generations a jump start and an advantage and while that may happen from time to time, for the majority of people its more subtle than that. 

You mentioned that its fair to say historical practices have influenced the paths of black Americans today. So looking back through history but particularly around the 1960s civil rights era, there are countless articles detailing various programs that put black families at a disadvantage. Some policies and programs intentionally targeted black families, others the people enforcing them found ways to take advantage. One of the most talked about was the practice of redlining, but there are others too.

Redlining made it difficult for black families to get approved for home loans in desirable areas even if they were just as or more qualified than white families. It wasnt that they didnt want to move, they were being denied based off of policies that were being used against them. Another event that hurt these communities was when factory jobs moved out of the cities and into the suburbs, where they werent being allowed to move. This loss of jobs put a lot of families on the path to poverty. Today, approximately 3 in 4 neighborhoods74 percentthat the HOLC deemed hazardous in the 1930s remain low to moderate income, and more than 60 percent are predominantly nonwhite. This shows how a practice from the 1930s is still influencing those areas today. 

This is where generational wealth normally comes in. Most wealth comes from property value. The properties in the suburbs have higher property values than the redlined areas. Plus, now the people living in the redlined areas have less job and income opportunities which makes it harder for them to be able to move out of these areas even as policies change to become less discriminatory. And over time the wealth gap has increased. What a lot of people dont think about though is that the increasing wealth gap affects us all. And its becoming more pronounced. But it does affect black families disproportionately because they started off at a disadvantage.

[Wealth Gap is Wider then the 1960s](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/todays-racial-wealth-gap-is-wider-than-in-the-1960s) 

Property values also play a role in school funding and there are studies showing how school funding affects education and opportunities for students. 

While the millionaires from your article may not have been given an inheritance, what opportunities did they have? Starting in grade school, how was the school funding and rating? If they started working at 15/16/17, were they able to keep their earnings to start saving? Going to college, did they have any contributions from family to help pay so they could focus on their studies? While they might not have bought brand new or luxury cars, what cars did they buy? I read in a similar article that the millionaires said you should live below your means and save 20% or more of your take home pay. How do you expect someone living in poverty, making $20,000 a year to realistically put away 20%? 

People growing up in low income areas tend go to schools that perform poorer. They tend to start working younger to help bring in extra income for the house, not for their savings. When thinking about college they may not have a way to pay or have to apply for massive student loans that they may not get approved for or will they have to work the whole time theyre going to school which could affect their studies. Looking at purchasing cars, buying a used car is a smart choice but theres a huge differences between used cars. I dont think theres many people living in low income areas are buying new or luxury cars, theyre buying cars that they get for a few grand but breaks down constantly which becomes a cycle of needing transportation to work but spending a lot of your money earned on your means of transportation. Where people who come from an advantaged place can get a car thats a few years old but still reliable. 

This is how history and the wealth gap is still affecting these communities today.

Personally, I believe poverty is the underlying issue. The statistics being cited apply to white people living in poverty too. I think that the wealth gap between poor, rich and middle class will continue to widen. And I believe that the reason black people are being disproportionately affected is due to the elements of history that have put them at a disadvantage.","22_2_3_1_1"

Schools are a valid point, and we fix that by allowing people to choose which school they want their children to attend, not forcing them into their district. Something democrats tend to be against.

As I conceded history has certainly altered the path of black america, but I do believe we are a point where those systemic disadvantages no longer exist or at the very least have not been occurring for some time and thus can be overcome. Even if we are to say ""Sure African americans got the short stick and as a result some white households ended up ahead"" what more can we do other than recognize our wrongs and ensure it doesnt happen again?

I know my experience seems to not matter much these days as a white male but I came up in a single parent violent household, did not inherit a dime, did not complete high school, did not attend college. I educated myself with the skills I would need to find success. There was not a single thing handed to me and yet I ended up in a higher earning bracket. Did I have to work harder than the kids who got handed everything? Sure. However it did not change the outcome.

This is why I firmly believe hard work trumps all, or according to the media it's likely just because of my white privilege.

This is not to downplay disadvantages African americans have been at historically but to say the best thing you can do is rise above it rather than continue a cycle of feeling like a victim. I absolutely believe that younger generations such as myself have equal opportunity free of systemic racism.

If anything we have classism in America, which one could argue has roots from racism. However it effects all colors. I simply do not believe ""racism"" is the answer to all woes in the modern day.","22_2_3_1_1_1"

But is this program addressing the problem?

It seem to be recognizing that not all schools offer equal opportunities but isn't correcting that inequality. If anything, I feel the success stories highlight that the problem with schools is a lack of resources and not a lack of potential in the kids. That's why I don't think school choice is the best answer. 

I agree that, for the most part, we are at a point where the systemic disadvantages of the past no longer exist but there are effects from that past that are even outside of the economic disadvantages in the black communities, primarily biases. You can see the effects of racism in our history in studies today that show that white job applicants are 36% more likely to be called for an interview over a black candidate even when the study controlled for each candidates qualifications. While I don't think the majority of the people in this country are racist, I do firmly believe that every single person regardless of color, background or education holds biases that we might not realize. Some of these biases are rooted in the past, some are rooted in how the past affected certain communities today. 

Thank you for sharing your story and don't ever feel like your experience doesn't matter. Everyone's story is important and I feel there's something we can learn from everyone's experiences.  

Words like racism and white privilege are thrown around a lot lately and I think it takes away from the points of the arguments. White privilege doesn't mean that a white person is handed everything, just that the color of their skin didn't make their circumstances harder. So when people use the phrase white privilege, it's not intended to say that no white people have suffered or struggled and I think that gets lost a lot. 

There's also this kind of story that has been created around the disadvantages black communities face to make it out to be a matter of character. I've heard so many different versions where they are labelled as lazy, lacking values, playing victims, etc. But I think you would find that the majority of people in those communities are people who are trying to break the cycle of poverty, who are working hard to provide food for their family and a roof over their head. I think you'll find there are more people like you who are trying to do more. The reason they are arguing systemic racism is that even when they do try to break that cycle they're met with bias that makes it harder for them to get an interview or to buy a house (even today). I'd be happy to locate some of the articles I found on the differences in traffic stops without a cause, the job applicant statistic or the breakdown of homeowners. 

But I feel you bring up the best point of all about classism in America. There is a huge wealth gap that is only getting larger. And as more people move closer and closer to poverty, I think we'll find many of the statistics disproportionately affecting black people will start to affect other races in larger proportions as the number of people in poverty grows larger. I think that's exactly why we need to address these issues today. I feel that one of the primary reasons these inequalities are being labeled an issue of race is that racism accelerated these issues for black communities. I worry that making it about race is distracting from the actual issue. Poverty, classism and the wealth gap are going to effect everyone.","22_2_3_1_1_1_1"

In terms of schools while I'm for school choice I'd agree it doesn't address underlying issues but I also dont think the usual idea of pouring more money into it does either. Providing a failed school district with more funds does not make it better, it's now just a well funded failed school district. Admittedly I'm not well versed enough on the various facets in play to propose better ideas but reevaluating teachers unions may be a start (and that goes for all unions for consistency). Of course when I say more funding doesnt solve anything I do not mean schools that are clearly lacking essential supplies.


I absolutely agree that to an extent everyone holds some degree of bias. Which is why I believe it's so important that groups who seek to change that bias do so through the correct avenues. The way we have seen things unfold does nothing but cause more division and as you said which I could not agree more with distracting from the real underlying issues. This is good for noone. 

I have never once thought as a generalization black communities are lazy or lacking values. When I see violent rioters, I believe they are lacking values. I understand the underlying sentiment but it is so far lost in translation. Shouting racism at everything or trying to make anyone who is white feel guilty for being simply being born white accomplishs nothing. Ignorance doesnt solve ignorance and discrimination does not solve discrimination. I'm far more likely to align myself and listen to any individual who despite potential challenges and hardship have a taken a level of personal responsibility to create the change they want to see by being law abiding citizens, working hard and overcoming obstacles to break bias. Unfortunately the media does not like to portray hard working Americans.

I do still believe though change needs to come from both sides, within the minds of Americans and from the black communities themselves. Completely ancedotal but my godfather who is black man, also a man whom I regard as a man of extreme character grew up in a lower income black neighborhood and still lives within his community to this day as a home owner. He has always told me one of the biggest challenges he had growing up was not neccesarily that of discrimination but from within his own community. Fleeing from gang violence, being physically threatened due to his refusal to be involved with gangs and so on. He made the choices to overcome the cycle and despite his surroundings made a respectable life for himself contributing to society as a firefighter. The plight of one whom overcomes adversity through hard work is always a message I can better relate to. Environments such as this must be fixed both from the outside and within.

As a nation we should always strive to be better, I just wish the message wasnt so muddled by further intolerance, anger and hatred and frankly stupidity that the real issues are left undiscussed. We get stuck spinning our wheels on race when in reality racism in it's TRUE sense does not explain most the issues communities face as they are present today. When we should be figuring out how we can fix broken systems that are failing the people at large.

The media is largely complicit in keeping us divided. I truly wish more civilized discussion could take place on actionable solutions.  

Anyhow thank you, I found this conversation thought provoking which is always beneficial in keeping myself grounded. It's easy these days to turn on the TV and let yourself become angry and at times misdirected.

Based on the research I've done, I believe that the issues black communities are facing are a combination of things. Racism, particularly in policy, have put black people at a disadvantage the effects of which we can see today. I also believe that bias, not necessarily racism, is impacting black people today, more than we realize. The past policies and current biases have led to an increased rate of poverty among black people that is worsening as the wealth gap increases and I think it's these two things that we need to address. 

Many of the statistics mentioned about increased crime, lack of education, more out of wedlock births etc. are found in low-income areas regardless of the makeup of the people living in the area. I feel that the reason these statistics appear to be higher in black communities is because the policies and actions of the past have accelerated the issues of poverty and the wealth gap for black communities. These issues are affecting all people in America, but we're noticing it in the black communities first because of this acceleration. 

I worry that looking at these issues solely through the lens of race is distracting from the root of the issue. Poverty, classism and the wealth gap are going to effect everyone and I believe that solving for those things, coupled with educational opportunities to learn how to recognize and overcome biases, is what will solve the issues we're seeing in black communities and prevent them from spreading to more Americans. By saying this I'm not trying to say that racism has been eradicated but I do think this is the path to a solution for the current problems.

Also 36% is not the same as being denied jobs, trying 36% harder is essential if people are to lift themselves from poverty.

Of course it is. Racist societies do not teach their children about systemic racism and the same goes for sexist societies. It's easy to see why. Teaching the truth about these things would be a direct threat to the status quo, so they aren't taught. If you never learn about systemic racism or sexism, then the status quo never has to worry about you fighting against them: you become an unconscious pawn in various systems of oppression through ignorance. Then you use your ignorance of the fact to claim the absence of the fact.","22_2_5_1_1_2_1"

It's common knowledge that America has a racial caste system that stretches back to its founding. It's also common knowledge that systemic racism exists in America. The Civil Rights Movement, and numerous Black and white scholars,  proved that obvious fact. MLK didn't retire peacefully after vanquishing systemic racism in America once and for all: he was murdered.

Just like this Reddit, they frog-in-boiling-water you with the idea that everything is already equal and racism is dead. Google ""gerrymandering"" for some systemic racism. How about suburbanites? In the late 1900s, black soldiers returning from WW2 were either straight up denied the benefits they served for (GI Bill, housing, respect from serving) and when they did get that sweet new house in Suburbia, real estate agents and disgruntled neighbors would start selling the nearby houses to only black people, creating segregated neighborhoods. This fueled the cycle of segregation in schools, lack of opportunity in the newly majority-black neighborhoods, and a normalizing if the cultural idea that black and white people could not share a community.

It is very difficult, if not impossible, to repair the damage done by those who desire to pervert the course of justice and convolute reason, when individuals do not believe any damage was done. The pendulum cannot correct its course when someone stops it midway, as it only bounces and swings further to the left. You also cannot prove a theorem by stating it is only half correct.

Why is ""healing the nation"" more important than reinforcing a nation that is built upon values and principles of liberty and justice?

Compromising is counterproductive, as it requires sacrificing a correct course of action in exchange for a less correct or incorrect course of action. This strategy of compromising requires that no matter how extreme one party swings, the other party must compromise their position, regardless of where the current middle ground is perceived. 

The act of compromising does not reinforce the current perceived middle ground, this is a fallacy, but rather the act of compromising completely redefines the middle ground. Thus, with every compromise to the left, both parties are then pulled toward the left, and any reference to what was once perceived as the former middle ground is lost.","2_1_1_1_2_2_1_1"

99% percent of parents still do this. Once again the fucking democrats are kowtowing to the whims of a minority. A minority of less than 1% of 1%. Your parents just weren't a bunch of woketards, they were real parents that respected you for you.","1_1"

I shunned pink and girly things and told my parents I thought I shouldve been a boy. They rightly told me that was silly. I also really, really wanted to be a horse, but that didnt happen either lol. 

I think a lot of us girls went through that phase because we felt like we had to choose between being a girly-girl or doing cool boy stuff. When I matured a little and got over my not like other girls mindset, I grew out of the tomboy behavior and embraced more feminine things. I finally started wearing makeup and stuff in high school. Theres nothing wrong with a girl or woman never being into more feminine things like wearing makeup or dresses (I still go back and forth between getting all dolled up and just throwing on tshirt and jeans with a bare face) but it does not make that woman into a man. 

The way TRAs behave now only reinforces the strict gender roles and ideals of the past and they make gender and sex into a mockery and a costume to be worn. And I firmly believe theres no such thing as a transgender child, any decisions about assuming a different gender should not be made until after theyre fully adults. Hormone therapy, gender affirming therapy, etc. is all child abuse and I expect that in another decade well begin to see the real damage this trend will cause to thousands of kids. Thank god I was able to grow up and into myself without the pressures of social media and my parents and The Discourse^tm influencing all of it and being on display for all to see.","1_2"

&gt; WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear challenges to the admissions process at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, presenting the most serious threat in decades to the use of affirmative action by the nation&amp;#039;s public and private colleges and universities.

&gt; The Supreme Court has long barred racial quotas in admissions.

&gt; If the Supreme Court did overrule its 2003 precedent, affirmative action programs would be in serious jeopardy nationwide.

I disagree that we should set quotas for immigration status for school attendance. Such regulations would be in direct violation of the free market and arbitrarily preventing private universities in particular the freedom of their own self-determination. A meritocracy is incomplete and farcical if it is regulated to deny talent.

The free market sometimes has to take a back seat to what is best for the nation.  Allowing our best universities to be attended by mostly foreign nationals (particularly in the STEM fields) just because the universities can charge them more hurts the US in terms of having fewer qualified US citizens to do the jobs here, and in making our geopolitical foes more capable.

Several of her arguments were based on this idea that the federal government should control all construction permitting everywhere.  She is saying that anyone who wants to build a home should have to call the army to come and check if their property is a wetland even if said property isn't connected in any way to a wetland.  And she gives presumptive guilt to land owners if they don't make such consultation under the reasoning that if a process exists, no matter how burdensome or opaque, then the land owner should known about it and go through it.  

Those aren't simple judicial disagreements.  Her arguments really are problematic on multiple levels and are flatly unintelligent.","3_1"

The solicitor for the EPA said this was possible and would be at no cost to the owner.

Her statement of what an owner should do is more a general statement that if you are making an investment in land it is assumed you would take the effort to verify the land you are purchasing. 

The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland. Chantell and Michael Sacket had recieved local permits, and started to build on it. That was back in 2007 which they were notified to stop building and contact the Army Corps of Engineers to obtain the necessary permits. They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

In 2012 the supreme court overturned that verdict. Back to the US District court, which they lost. It was determined they did fill the land without the appropriate permits. 

We are back in court to settle the standing of the Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which determine the scope and responsibility of a federal agencies actions. In 2006 another court case amended the precedence for how to apply the APA. Using that case as a foundation Sackets brought the case up again. And here we are.

A simplification of the history to now.

The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity. How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland? That is what the APA covers. Who and to what level are federal agencies required to notify the larger public. Would it be sufficient to offer a process to verify? That is the point she is making. Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify. Sackets are holding the side that it isn't them and really the local officials. Once they had the permit they were good to go. 

I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review. I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit. That stars with going to a community that has land available to use as you see fit. 

The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area. 

I am not a fan of someone building adjacent to where I hunt or fish. It can not be a free for all. They are from Spokane and found a beautiful lake.

It should never be assumed a land owner will participate in or even be aware of an opaque or overly burdensome process, which this is.  We are not going to go down the road of demanding everyone in the country call the army to find out if they can build their home.

&gt;The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland.

That's your opinion, and I vehemently disagree with it.  Even if that were the core issue of the case, you seem to presume that simply because someone says it is a wetland that it must be a wetland.  It is not.

&gt;They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

That in and of itself is rather ludicrous since they are the damaged party.  And that's a big part of what I was referencing earlier, the fact that Jackson and judges like her argue that the EPA's judgment is beyond reproach or appeal.  It's a ludicrous argument, and that judgment was rightly overturned.

&gt;The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity.

This touches on the core of my analysis of Jackson's arguments.  If the local permitting doesn't matter whatsoever and is made void by even an arbitrary or erroneous decisions from a federal bureaucracy, then the power of states and local governments to zone and construct is utterly null and void.  That is the start of a serious separation of powers debate.

&gt;How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland?

That is a very good question, and I think it speaks well of you that would ask it.  What I find problematic is that Jackson did **not** ask it and is blithely unconcerned by it.  She presumes the landowner's guilt with a dismissive ""shoulda known"" argument that ignores the fact that lawful governmental authority permitted the construction.  

&gt;Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify.

You are now making the same egregious argument Jackon makes.  The landowner contacted the government.  The government said it was okay to build and issued a permit.  There is no reasonable expectation that homeowner would know otherwise when the lawful governing authority certified the construction.  If there is a fault to be laid on anyone in that case, it is to be laid on the local government, not the landowner. 

&gt;I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review.

Nobody said it was.  What it being said, to put it in crude prose, is that Jackson showed her ass and brought her knowledge of law into serious question.  And she did.  She had several outbursts where she interrupted justices trying to ask their own questions of the litigants, and that is a serious breach of decorum in the high court.

&gt;I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit.

There we agree, and I also support the preservation of certain lands for environmental reasons.  But as you rightly pointed out, that's not really the issue brought up by this article.

&gt;The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area.

Colloquial use of the term is not the same as the legal or technical use of the term.  Advertising language is not binding or indicative of legal liability unless it is an intentional lie meant to deceive consumers.  

&gt;with all of that what was flatly unintelligent about her questions?

As I said previously in another reply, there are multiple unintelligent aspects to her comments.

First is the presumption of guilt she hoists on the landowner when the landowner received a certification from the government to construct.  This is beyond being an unreasonable argument.  It is unintelligent.  To hold anyone legally accountable you would have to prove they intended to flaunt the law, and that is literally impossible if they can produce a permit showing that the government authorized their actions.  

Secondly, she made reference to the issue of standing in such a way that, if she is to be literally interpreted, says the federal bureaucracy is beyond reproach or appeal and that their judgments are final.  It allows for no checks and balances on federal power or abuses whatsoever, and we all know that is a faulty argument on its face.  How she could think otherwise is a mystery... unless she's just that unintelligent.

Thirdly, she makes the argument that if any process exists, no matter how arbitrary or opaque, then the public is adequately serviced and the government is absolved of all responsibility or liability.  Again, there's more case law stating otherwise than one could possibly post on Reddit.  Just think about the implications of this for a moment.  If this were in fact the case, then how could Trump have ever been stopped from doing any of his administrative actions the way he was?  Take ending DACA, for example.  The courts have stated that there has to be a reasonable and clearly expressed process and ruleset for making decisions on such actions.  The government is not presumptively right in all of its judgments.  Jackson, though, seems to think otherwise, at least as far as the EPA is concerned.

The reason this case made it this far is precisely because of the multiple legal reasoning problems with it.  Multiple courts at this point have issued rulings that have serious and sometimes dubious legal problems.  That is not a problem necessarily with those courts.  It's a problem with the core legal reasonings behind the laws that establish and govern agencies like the EPA.  And now SCOTUS will hopefully clarify some of these issues.","3_1_1_1"

I touched on this particular aspect of her statements in another post.  It is troubling that she even thought that this was a valid line of questioning to begin with.  The litigants have in hand a permit issued by the local government.  At that point, whether or not it is a wetland is immaterial.  They literally went to the government and got approval to build.  It is not on the landowner to settle disagreements the government has with itself.

She made several assertions in her arguments that were factually wrong and even a couple that are legally dubious.  Granted, we are not in the courtroom and can't hear everything she said in its full context.

The crux of her argument was this.  If it was somehow possible for you to find out if a puddle in your yard was a wetland, no matter how hidden or convoluted that method may be, then the government should go after you with the full force of the law for not figuring it out.

I mean, this doesn't even make sense on the most basic level.  This is over land plots that are disconnected from wetlands, not waterways themselves.  We're not talking rivers, swamps, ponds, lakes, etc.  We're talking about a residential property on the other side of a highway from a waterway that has no water on it unless it rains and makes a puddle.  The EPA tried to claim it to be ""wetlands"" and prohibited any kind of construction on it.  And here Jackson is saying that the EPA shouldn't have its judgment questioned at all and that the property owner should go to jail for not assuming that a property within an unknown distance of water was potentially a wetland.

She made an absolutely unintelligible argument that is wholly inconsistent with the law and did so repeatedly never tweaking or even clarififying that argument. Instead, she just repeatedly interrupted the other justices to essentially say the EPA cannot be questioned and cannot be wrong in their judgment. 

Let me just lay out really quick why her argument is so puzzling and so horrendously ignorant.  Construction permits are handled locally, not federally.  But the EPA inserted itself into the process in some places by claiming lands that are not connected to wetlands at all fall under their jurisdiction and cannot be used for any construction purposes.  This specific case centers around a plot of land on the other side of a highway from a waterway.  It's not a wetland.  It has no water on it at all and is not in any way connected to a waterway.  It was zoned for residential use.

Now, Jackson says the property owner should have known or sought out a process to find out if the land was a wetland.  Again, there's no water on this land, and it is separated from waterways by a major highway.  There's no reasonable thought process for anyone to believe it would be a wetland.  But she says that since you can call... the army... that you are expected to call for **any** construction project anywhere and that if you don't you should be jailed.  

Now, this is unintelligent for multiple reasons.  First, it means that the federal government now holds the power of permitting over all land and that everyone everywhere has to consult... the military... to undergo construction projects.  That alone is a violation of the separation of powers between the state and federal governments.  Secondly, it means that there is a presumption of guilt on the part of land owners as there is no appeal process for the EPA's judgment, even in a case as ridiculous as this.  Jackson says no, if the EPA says it, you go to jail.  Thirdly, and most idiotic, is her argument that no matter how opaque a process may be, the fact that one exists at all in any form absolved the government of any fault whatsoever.  

These are just terrible legal arguments that a first year law student would see problems with and wouldn't dare attempt.  But she was so brazenly confident in these arguments that she thought it appropriate to talk over the other justices as they asked questions of the litigants.  She really caused a lot of head scratching with these little outbursts.  It seems in its face like an argument for total supremacy for all levels of federal bureaucracy.  That's not a smart case to make given the structure of our country.","8_1"

Yes permits are local, but when it comes to waters of the US, that is a federal issue that is managed by the EPA and army corps, who issue permits for anything around fill material and dredge around navigate or waters, which the court has ruled to include wetlands that are adjacent to navigable waters.

Affirmative action was a necessary part but now I feel it's just too heavily applied at the detriment of everyone involved.  The ones it's supposed to help, it hurts, because it sets them up for failure in the workforce because they didn't (necessarily) have to work as hard as their peers to get there.  And for everyone else it hurts them because they may be more qualified but get passed over because it's better to hire a minority with slightly less qualifications.

I'm all for giving people an equal shot, but it needs to BE equal.  And I'm fully aware that it is overwhelmingly difficult to ""get out of the ghetto"".  But I think that is more to do with the war on drugs' systemic racism than employers not wanting to hire black people. 

Now let's discuss the article

&gt;  If we are admitting more black students, Latino students, and female students, the assumption is that fewer white, Asian, and male students are being admitted into college all across the country

There was an interesting study recently discussing how there are far more women completing college than men I'll see if I can find it (on mobile).  In it, it showed while men and women have been entering college around the same rate, women are more likely to compete it.  One of the suggested reasons for this is it far easier for a minority to get a scholarship these days than a white male.

Now, I can't say I agree that affirmative action started out a reparations for Jim Crow laws, to be frank I actually think affirmative action really did help people at the beginning.  But these days, I can't say that it's as necessary as it was and the longer it sticks around the more and more it is quickly becoming reparations instead of just trying to give people an equal shot.  


Honestly, I think it's more about criminal justice reform and dealing with the war on drugs in a different manner than employment BTMO.","1"

Personally, I think the problem is that when it was enacted certain minority groups had a more difficult time obtaining a good education and good career than their white counterpart due to institutionalize racism, etc. However, I dont think that the difficulties were the same then as they are now and when its still applied so broadly its no longer as beneficial. For example, there are blacks and hispanics who come from affluent enough families where they may not need to benefit from it but do. And at the other end you have whites born to poverty who face similar challenges and don't have similar help. 

I do agree that we should be trying to address the root of the problem, like ending the war on drugs, rather than trying to fix it at the back end. As partisan as the two parties are though, I really don't see this being addressed anytime soon.

But when you look at the actual policy of affirmative action, and the way colleges implement it, it doesn't strictly matter *how many* minorities are wealthy; they're going to benefit either way (with a few notable demographic exceptions). 

So insofar as blacks are poorer than the rest of America, AA helps. But why wouldn't we adjust the policy to actually correct for wealth, regardless of race?

Also, as a side-note, there are conservative arguments in support of reparations.  I recommend [this take](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/taking-reparations-seriously/).

All that said, I am personally skeptical of affirmative action as a good way to achieve racial equality (or implement reparations if that's something you want to do).  I've seen affirmative action abused in a particularly harmful way: contracts given to ""minority-owned"" businesses that are run by super-wealthy members of racial minorities who are relatively recent immigrants from foreign countries, where they were part of those countries' elites...competing against, taking these contracts away from locally-owned businesses that could be providing those same services, and that are probably more likely to actually employ and/or be owned by racial minorities of lower to modest socioeconomic status.","2_1"

Examples:

* We could work to eliminate racially-charged Gerrymandering in the south, especially Mississippi, but also states like North Carolina.   This might attract more black voters to the GOP.  White racism in the deep south is a scourge to society and I think it's particularly disturbing and shameful that in some localities the GOP has allowed Democrats to ""own"" the anti-racist efforts.  There are black conservatives and as soon as we start stepping up and thoroughly rooting out racism, we're going to start appealing to them.
* We could work to address inequalities in school funding that disenfranchise black people.  In some states, such as Ohio, these even pose constitutional problems, with the state constitution.  The typical setup is that a black district has a weaker tax base so it faces higher tax rates but lower tax revenues.  I'm not 100% sure what the best fix would be, but some sort of equalizing of funding at the state level might help.  I think this is a conservative issue because the racial wealth disparities often go hand-in-hand with astronomical local tax rates.  These rates are something that I think any conservative would care about or be troubled by, if they knew about them.  In some cases, black communities are plagued by greater corruption in municipal government: addressing this corruption could directly help these communities, helping them to lower tax rates as their funds are better used.
* Restructuring the tax code so as to increase wealth mobility could go a long way to helping to erase past power disparities that have been passed down through generations.  This is why, in spite of agreeing with *most* of the proposed tax reforms that libertarians and conseratives advocate (moving away from income tax, hugely simplifying the tax code, lowering tax across the board, shifting more towards consumption-based taxes and use taxes), I still support progressive taxation and estate tax.
* Doing something to address police brutality might be good too.  Police violence against unarmed people disproportionately affects black and hispanic people in the U.S., and they're a key issue in particular that the black community cares about...look at how it's a focus of the black lives matter movement.  I think there is a lot of common ground for conservatives to share concern with the police brutality issues affecting black people: a lot of these cases have to do with police over-reaction to legal gun ownership, like the [Philando Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) case.  There are examples of successful reforms to address these issues, Dallas, TX ([source](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/07/09/dallas-took-action-to-reform-police-force/)) is a particularly good one.  [Here is a general piece](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/252969-calling-all-mayors-this-is-what-police-reform-should-look) with some recommendations.

I think if we started taking racial issues more seriously, we would have more political capital for eliminating affirmative action.  And I personally think this would be hugely beneficial: affirmative action is problematic on many levels.  It can be abused, and it can create or reinforce a perception of racial minorities as being less competent than their white coworkers or peers.  I think it would be strongly preferable for us to address racial power and economic disparities through other means.  But there are serious inequalities, and I think merely calling to remove affirmative action without addressing the deeper problems is politically infeasible, and is likely to feed into the stereotype of Republicans being racist and not caring about racial minorities.

I want us to step up and start addressing these problems.  We can best prove that we care about racial minorities by successfully addressing the issues disproportionately affecting their communities.","4"

&gt; His poor performance in office reinforces the view of those who think that he made it to the White House because his race provided him with an advantage that offset his lack of qualifications

The thing is, from an objective point of view, he's done quite well in office.  He's achieved a lot.  Granted, most of what he's achieved hasn't been good for the country, and a lot of it has been anything but what he campaigned on - but you can't say much different about most presidents.

I think he's achieved a lot of his actual agenda (which is different than the campaign promises he made).  Heck, he even managed to get a national healthcare plan that most Americans don't want passed (never mind that pesky Constitution).  We'll see a lot more of his actual agenda if he wins a second term, since he won't have to worry about re-election then.  

He's also been very good at controlling the media by controlling access (if you don't toe the line, you don't get access), and he's got a top notch spin team across the whole government.  If he thought it helped his re-election campaign, your house could be on fire and he'd be able to produce charts from government departments that proved why that was a good thing (just don't look too hard at the numbers).

The only thing preventing him from being a shoo-in in November is the poor economic numbers - and he's got government departments doing everything they can to convince people that it is a good thing that people are leaving the workforce in unprecedented numbers yet the employment rate isn't changing, and that the national debt is 50% higher than when he took office.

His re-election hinges on Americans believing the economy is improving - and he's in a unique position to make that happen (at least in the extreme short term before the election - never mind about what happens in the long term, he won't be running for office then).  

*If you want to let your inner paranoid play for a bit, you can even imagine that he's planning for the coming financial collapse to happen during his second term, so that he can declare a national emergency and postpone elections in 2016.*

So on that basis, its really hard to say his performance has been poor.  It just hasn't been good for the country.","1"

Sad but true. The novelty factor of his racial status is a big factor here. A presidential candidate with a *complete and utter lack of meaningful experience* would have been laughed at if he/she were white - hell Palin got and still gets tons of flak and she even had govt experience.

It was, though. It was pure novelty - I'd be thrilled to vote for a black conservative too, so I can understand where they are coming from. 

But regarding your friends I'm surprised - the left is really big on accusing the right of racism being the factor behind dislike of Obama, whereas the right only brings up race to point out the fact that we elected someone with zero experience running *anything* because of race.

No, he is considered black.

Half-white/half-minority people are only considered 'white' when they do something wrong - ie. George Zimmerman. Otherwise they are called black/hispanic/whatever.

I don't thinks it's racist for you to talk about his race, and I never said it was, but I consider that your position won't gain much empathy, assuming you're white. You can hold me to the same standard because I am white. I am also an independent voter who has no choice but to put up with both the Republicans' and the Democrats' shit in order to get my viewpoint across, and trust me, I get pissed whenever Democrats pull the racist card against Republicans.

To clarify myself, I don't think this rhetoric, largely shared by Republicans and independent conservatives, that ""Obama only got elected because he's black"", is *racist*. What this says is that everything sucks about Obama *except* that he's black. The reason that I'm offended by this statement is because the largest voting group in the U.S. is independents, most of whom found a good reason to vote for Obama, and whose goal is not to take down the Republicans whenever they can. And by saying that all of these people supported Obama without reading his books, examining his character, or watching him during his campaign, you are not insulting black voters, but anyone who supports Obama for what kind of man he is inside.

I think you can talk objectively about him being black, but I don't think your analysis is free from dislike for Obama's policies, and therefore is not objective. I'm certain that his race had in impact on the election in that it has had an impact on who he is. Character is what really defines an election, not experience or qualification. We elect people who appear to have reached a high level of self actualization. It's well known, if not easily inferred that Obama has had struggles with his identity, which propelled him into having to find answers to deep questions of self from a unusually early age. I've seen videos of him from Harvard 20 years ago, and there's an eerie feeling even then that would be president, which is the same case for a lot of presidents, and it's a personality thing. Objectively, whatever path he has been lead on (in his case, his racial struggles and lack of a father figure; in Reagan's case, being a Hollywood actor and a Democrat; in Bush's case, being an alcoholic to a born-again Christian, and so on), has granted him some spiritual wisdom. In other words, he seems like a really nice, likable gentleman (maybe not to you, but that's beside the point). With this, he gained the respect of a lot of people before his campaign, before he was scripted or had teleprompters, who were actually the ones who pressured him into running before he had finished his term as senator, which perhaps he ought not to have. This could also be because the Democrats had no one better to run, but that says more about the National Democratic Party than about the majority of voters. The fact about his campaign is that it alone inspired a movement of altruism and political efficacy, and he has been a role model for the black community, and another fact is that it did not increase membership in the Democratic party, which is actually on the decline. Whether all Obama supporters are misguided is a matter of opinion. I'm not endorsing his policies, because like you I have real hold-ups about many of them; this should go beyond political belief. So, while I have to respect all opinions, it is absurd, both rhetorically and politically, to blame his *entire* election on the electorate's will to have a black president. And in this election, now that we've already elected a black president, who now has a substantial presidential resume, we have a lot more to talk about than that. I'd be interested to read a rebuttal to my sentiments, and you can match me in length if necessary.

* When I say Obama won because of his race I don't mean every single person voted for him exclusively based on that. What I mean is that he won the election - persuaded a lot of additional voters needed to swing it in his favor - because of the novelty in electing a first black president. I say this because, like many other white people, I see the appeal in being able to 'prove' that I'm not racist by supporting a black man (in my case it was Herman Caine).

* This novelty factor is what allowed him to become president with his severe lack of experience in any kind of official governing position, which would otherwise cripple other candidates

* His race also required his opponents to walk on egg-shells with attacks lest they be seen as racist. Too much aggression would be seen as 'white man keeping a black man down'

(some supporting evidence not directly tied to the election, but relevant)

Additionally, the sheer adoration of Obama by the media was partly due to the celebration of electing a black man. For quite some time he was literally seen as the messiah - which there isn't anything inherently wrong with except for the fact that he *hadn't even done anything yet*. He won a freakin' nobel prize without having done anything yet. I just can't see any of those things happening to a white man, no matter what political party he was affiliated with.

Lastly, Obama is half white. We never hear about this - he is referred to as black. George Zimmerman, the guy that shot Trayvon Martin, was also half white and half hispanic. He isn't referred to as hispanic - he was referred to, initially, as white...and then later 'white-hispanic' once the media had been corrected. I only bring this up to further illustrate the obsession with propping up minorities and demonizing white people in leftwing politics.","2_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

For example, a student who would perform solidly well in a state school gets accepted into a much more rigorous school for which they are unsuited, and then proceed to fail out of. 

I see the Obama presidency in very much the same light. There is no way that a white person, whose only qualifications amounted to a 1/2 term in the Senate and holding the position of ""Community Organizer"", would have been placed in the position of running the country. A person like that is just simply unprepared for the job. They have no experience, and no track record. 

Very predictably, we end up with the mess that we see today. ","3"

Precisely - the novelty factor played into the last election big time, and continues to play into it (with the addition of so many sources of media projecting his greatness like propaganda).

You also have to realize that Obama isn't the driving force behind his own success - he was picked, groomed, and hoisted by the leftwing machine - and they were very effective at it. ","3_1"

Of course, there are white kids who work their asses off too, but they don't get into the same schools as people like Sotomayor or Obama, they go to state schools.  With so many spots guaranteed for old money white kids, affirmative action has cut out the ivy league spots for high achieving white kids, and replaced them with high-achieving minorities.

Sotomayor can talk about the privilege of rich, white Americans because she's seen it, but she lacks the life experiences to talk about affirmative action because she herself has been too privileged to see the downsides to poor and middle class white Americans.","2"

In my opinion, from studying the recent history of the GOP, religion has played a huge part in how the party has become what it currently is. People like Ralph Reed, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson were successful in hitching millions of Christians to the GOP wagon through the Moral Majority. One cannot have a complete picture of the change in the GOP over the past thirty years without studying this movement. Understanding the Moral Majority is essential to understanding the current base of the GOP. 

Here is a decent write up on this topic that I found after a cursory Google search.

http://www.theocracywatch.org/taking_over.htm

And I'm not sure if you are implying that I am slandering Christians, but if so, please know that slander is not my intent. I am, if fact, a Christian myself. I am Texan born and raised, and I take my heritage and spiritual convictions very seriously. This is also why I am so firmly against the mixture of politics and religion that the current GOP not only promotes and cultivates, but relies on to win elections. The role of government is to protect the civil rights of all citizens regardless of faith, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Any law that infringes on these civil rights is morally wrong, especially if the rationale for limiting rights is a particular interpretation of the bible. If we allow scripture to guide our laws, we inevitably reach a point where the interpretation and understanding of the bible begins to vary wildly from denomination to denomination. If the goal is to use the bible as the basis for our laws, who's interpretation forms that basis? Catholicism? Babtist? Mormon? 

This type of theocracy threatens to restrict my ability to practice my faith how I see fit. For evidence, please look no further than the Anglican Church in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. The Pilgrim's migration was brought upon by the Church and the State becoming one. So in a sense, the overwhelmingly significant basis for the US's creation was for the Pilgrims to settle a land where religion is kept in churches and politics is left in the capitol halls. 

But please don't think I find no place for faith in politics. My faith guides my political ideology, but what I do not do is use the Bible as justification for implementing my political agenda. If I do not believe in gay marriage, I will not get gay married. If I do not believe in abortion, I will not suggest my wife get an abortion. If I believe fornication is corrupting, I will teach this to my children and hope they make wise decisions. What I will not do is use the law to codify my beliefs into the laws of the land. There is no *secular* rationale, in my opinion, (and in the California circuit court's opinion) for denying homosexuals the right to marry. Absent religion, homosexuals would have had marriage rights decades ago. I will not deny a woman the right to make healthcare decisions that best suit her needs as a human. Same with abstinence only education. If I am against abortion, it would make sense to promote the use of contraceptives, would it not? Anyone that is pro-life and anti-contraception is guided by their interpretation of the bible and not by secular reasoning of civil rights. My faith stops where someone else's faith or lack of faith begins.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, but I guess I needed to clarify my point. My ideology boils down to one thing. Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. Render unto god that which is god's. Jesus did not instruct us to bring forth His kingdom through the federal government of the Unites States. The kingdom is brought forth through His Church, which is subject only to the head, Christ. I obey the laws of the land and let the Spirit guide my faith. 

If Christians want to make America a Christian nation, they should do so through their church by preaching the Gospel. Christians should not attempt to make America Christian or serve God by way of the federal government. ","2_1_2_1"

Though they get a ton of donations from these corporations, so you will see a lot of their greed and fear ads, and dumb people are easily drawn in giving them their base. 

 They pretend to care about the deficit when it suits them, in order to close programs for the poor.  Then are fine with spending more than 25% of our tax dollar on military operations, and spending more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are allies.  They are fine with keeping medicare as it is and paying vastly more than any other country on earth, because they all know a voucher system with a finite amount of medical coverage attached wont be fair or moral.  They are fine with tax breaks for people that dont deserve or need them.

I don't have data, and I doubt that anyone outside of MIT admissions really knows, but there's a perception among Asians at MIT that they are heavily discriminated *against*.

[Here](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-it-is-harder-for-Asian-Americans-to-get-into-top-colleges) is a discussion with lots of charts arguing that Asians have higher admission rates at top schools because they come from backgrounds that have higher admission rates, e.g. they're disproportionately from households with two working parents of high education producing high income. And while total admissions of Asians is rising (in California), the admission *rate* is unchanged; the rise is due to the larger number of Asians applying.

I benefitted from legacy admissions, but I don't think it is fair nor do I think it makes sense from an admissions standpoint, although I do think there can be a degree to which it makes some sense: if a school has seen a strong track record of good performance by people from a certain family, it is probably a pretty good sign that further people from this family will continue to perform well.  Academic skills are directly passed down through families.

I do wonder though if colleges accept legacy students because of a direct financial interest; as an example, both my parents stopped giving to their alma mater when my brother was rejected from them.

So like, even if colleges act in the best interest of admissions, it might have a negative consequence in terms of the college's finances, which could actually drive up tuition costs for other students in the long-run, and/or take away funding which could be used for need-based scholarships.  Colleges effectively subsidize low-socioeconomic-status students with tuition from high socioeconomic-status students and donors.  Eliminating legacy admissions could remove one of the ways this operates, and thus adversely affect students of low or even average socioeconomic status.","3_2"

This is less a race issue than it is a poverty issue. The challenge is that our society sees poverty and race as being inextricably intertwined such that you cannot have a conversation about one without the other. 

Poor communities cannot afford to throw the same amount of resources at education as wealthier communities. Thats just a fact. And the students of those poor communities suffer. And as a result they are behind the power curve when it comes to things like college. What you end up having is a system where the majority of those who test better are those who had the resources (schooling, home life, extracurricular, etc) to put them on a better footing.

What we need is a way to bring those who are stuck in that impoverished state up to par with those who have the resources behind them. I have no idea how we do that, but thats the challenge.

One of the reforms Finland did, a few decades ago when their schools were ranked internationally about the same as US schools, was change to national funding of schools. School funding became based on the number of students attending the school, rather than on the local tax base, with extra funding for schools that have students with special needs (disability, large immigrant populations that need extra resources to catch up, and so on).

Since then, the US has stayed about where it was in rankings, and Finland is near the top.

Republicans are adverse at making a tailored made solution to fit the voter. That's called identity politics. Republicans prefer to create a one size fit all solution and try to convince everyone of the same message. For example, trying to convince a voter that lives in a rent control apartment that he is better getting rid of rent control. Let the market set rent prices and in the long run he will be better off.

Yes, among african americans this rate is the highest. However the modern day culture does not largely view out of wedlock births as the stigma it once was. Out of wedlock births *are* a result of irresponsibility, *but* they are by and large *not* carried out on purpose. Rather, unplanned pregnancies are generally accidents.

Additionally, the vast majority of african americans are working people. I dont know why so many people on here constantly correlate welfare with african americans. Most african americans are not on welfare, and among those that do receive government assistance, the majority of those folks are the working poor. 

You mention how most african americans do not try to improve their lives and how most do not go to college. Many conservatives tend to have this sentiment. If that is the case in your opinion, then why are so many threatened by affirmative action? After all, if we are so lazy and dont work, then that would mean hardly any of us would be benefiting from affirmative action anyways, right?

I think the problem is that many people do not know african americans personally and form their opinion on what they see on television. Therein lies one of the problems.","22_2_2"

Single parent households disproportionately contribute criminals. About 1/4 of all African Americans are on Food Stamps, so around 10 million people, I would say thats a big number.

What do you mean threatened by Affirmative Action, the fact is that in a population of 40 million, some will obviously benefit, but the vast majority of African Americans dont go to college, and the ones that do (on Affirmative Action) essentially take someone elses spot.

Affirmative Action literally states that the color of you skin determines the value of your hard work, how valuable you are is a factor of not your talents, but how many colors a college can show on their brochure. The people benefiting from it today rely on the mistreatment of their ancestors to sidestep real requirements, and ultimately reduce the standards of all colleges.","22_2_2_1"

I think a major problem with ""slavery ending 140 years ago, segregation nearly 60 years ago"" is you are ignoring that generational wealth is a thing.  60 years means that a grandparent wasn't given the same education and opportunity which then translates to their kids not having the same opportunity.  When most black people's grandparents lived through segregation and then had nothing for their kids, the generations after will take a while to catch up to other races that did not have that setback.  That does not mean that there are no poor white people in the U.S. or that it is somehow the fault of a white person today.  It just means that when a country has set up so many roadblocks for a group of people, you can't just remove the roadblock and say all is fair.

Just an fyi, I am someone who believes that if extra opportunities are to be given, it should be given based on the kid's families income and not race based.  However, that doesn't mean that I don't believe that African Americans have not suffered in America through history.","22_2_3"

I think one problem is how its being presented. The way its being talked about makes it sound like parents and grandparents are writing large checks that give the younger generations a jump start and an advantage and while that may happen from time to time, for the majority of people its more subtle than that. 

You mentioned that its fair to say historical practices have influenced the paths of black Americans today. So looking back through history but particularly around the 1960s civil rights era, there are countless articles detailing various programs that put black families at a disadvantage. Some policies and programs intentionally targeted black families, others the people enforcing them found ways to take advantage. One of the most talked about was the practice of redlining, but there are others too.

Redlining made it difficult for black families to get approved for home loans in desirable areas even if they were just as or more qualified than white families. It wasnt that they didnt want to move, they were being denied based off of policies that were being used against them. Another event that hurt these communities was when factory jobs moved out of the cities and into the suburbs, where they werent being allowed to move. This loss of jobs put a lot of families on the path to poverty. Today, approximately 3 in 4 neighborhoods74 percentthat the HOLC deemed hazardous in the 1930s remain low to moderate income, and more than 60 percent are predominantly nonwhite. This shows how a practice from the 1930s is still influencing those areas today. 

This is where generational wealth normally comes in. Most wealth comes from property value. The properties in the suburbs have higher property values than the redlined areas. Plus, now the people living in the redlined areas have less job and income opportunities which makes it harder for them to be able to move out of these areas even as policies change to become less discriminatory. And over time the wealth gap has increased. What a lot of people dont think about though is that the increasing wealth gap affects us all. And its becoming more pronounced. But it does affect black families disproportionately because they started off at a disadvantage.

[Wealth Gap is Wider then the 1960s](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/todays-racial-wealth-gap-is-wider-than-in-the-1960s) 

Property values also play a role in school funding and there are studies showing how school funding affects education and opportunities for students. 

While the millionaires from your article may not have been given an inheritance, what opportunities did they have? Starting in grade school, how was the school funding and rating? If they started working at 15/16/17, were they able to keep their earnings to start saving? Going to college, did they have any contributions from family to help pay so they could focus on their studies? While they might not have bought brand new or luxury cars, what cars did they buy? I read in a similar article that the millionaires said you should live below your means and save 20% or more of your take home pay. How do you expect someone living in poverty, making $20,000 a year to realistically put away 20%? 

People growing up in low income areas tend go to schools that perform poorer. They tend to start working younger to help bring in extra income for the house, not for their savings. When thinking about college they may not have a way to pay or have to apply for massive student loans that they may not get approved for or will they have to work the whole time theyre going to school which could affect their studies. Looking at purchasing cars, buying a used car is a smart choice but theres a huge differences between used cars. I dont think theres many people living in low income areas are buying new or luxury cars, theyre buying cars that they get for a few grand but breaks down constantly which becomes a cycle of needing transportation to work but spending a lot of your money earned on your means of transportation. Where people who come from an advantaged place can get a car thats a few years old but still reliable. 

This is how history and the wealth gap is still affecting these communities today.

Personally, I believe poverty is the underlying issue. The statistics being cited apply to white people living in poverty too. I think that the wealth gap between poor, rich and middle class will continue to widen. And I believe that the reason black people are being disproportionately affected is due to the elements of history that have put them at a disadvantage.","22_2_3_1_1"

Schools are a valid point, and we fix that by allowing people to choose which school they want their children to attend, not forcing them into their district. Something democrats tend to be against.

As I conceded history has certainly altered the path of black america, but I do believe we are a point where those systemic disadvantages no longer exist or at the very least have not been occurring for some time and thus can be overcome. Even if we are to say ""Sure African americans got the short stick and as a result some white households ended up ahead"" what more can we do other than recognize our wrongs and ensure it doesnt happen again?

I know my experience seems to not matter much these days as a white male but I came up in a single parent violent household, did not inherit a dime, did not complete high school, did not attend college. I educated myself with the skills I would need to find success. There was not a single thing handed to me and yet I ended up in a higher earning bracket. Did I have to work harder than the kids who got handed everything? Sure. However it did not change the outcome.

This is why I firmly believe hard work trumps all, or according to the media it's likely just because of my white privilege.

This is not to downplay disadvantages African americans have been at historically but to say the best thing you can do is rise above it rather than continue a cycle of feeling like a victim. I absolutely believe that younger generations such as myself have equal opportunity free of systemic racism.

If anything we have classism in America, which one could argue has roots from racism. However it effects all colors. I simply do not believe ""racism"" is the answer to all woes in the modern day.","22_2_3_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/hjky8w/no_system_is_targeting_minorities_in_america/","SamwiseIsAHero","2020-07-02",1593710579,2,2,0,0,"In regards to school choice, I think it's great that some kids are receiving an opportunity to attend a school outside of their district and I have heard some heartwarming success stories. 

But is this program addressing the problem?

It seem to be recognizing that not all schools offer equal opportunities but isn't correcting that inequality. If anything, I feel the success stories highlight that the problem with schools is a lack of resources and not a lack of potential in the kids. That's why I don't think school choice is the best answer. 

I agree that, for the most part, we are at a point where the systemic disadvantages of the past no longer exist but there are effects from that past that are even outside of the economic disadvantages in the black communities, primarily biases. You can see the effects of racism in our history in studies today that show that white job applicants are 36% more likely to be called for an interview over a black candidate even when the study controlled for each candidates qualifications. While I don't think the majority of the people in this country are racist, I do firmly believe that every single person regardless of color, background or education holds biases that we might not realize. Some of these biases are rooted in the past, some are rooted in how the past affected certain communities today. 

Thank you for sharing your story and don't ever feel like your experience doesn't matter. Everyone's story is important and I feel there's something we can learn from everyone's experiences.  

Words like racism and white privilege are thrown around a lot lately and I think it takes away from the points of the arguments. White privilege doesn't mean that a white person is handed everything, just that the color of their skin didn't make their circumstances harder. So when people use the phrase white privilege, it's not intended to say that no white people have suffered or struggled and I think that gets lost a lot. 

There's also this kind of story that has been created around the disadvantages black communities face to make it out to be a matter of character. I've heard so many different versions where they are labelled as lazy, lacking values, playing victims, etc. But I think you would find that the majority of people in those communities are people who are trying to break the cycle of poverty, who are working hard to provide food for their family and a roof over their head. I think you'll find there are more people like you who are trying to do more. The reason they are arguing systemic racism is that even when they do try to break that cycle they're met with bias that makes it harder for them to get an interview or to buy a house (even today). I'd be happy to locate some of the articles I found on the differences in traffic stops without a cause, the job applicant statistic or the breakdown of homeowners. 

But I feel you bring up the best point of all about classism in America. There is a huge wealth gap that is only getting larger. And as more people move closer and closer to poverty, I think we'll find many of the statistics disproportionately affecting black people will start to affect other races in larger proportions as the number of people in poverty grows larger. I think that's exactly why we need to address these issues today. I feel that one of the primary reasons these inequalities are being labeled an issue of race is that racism accelerated these issues for black communities. I worry that making it about race is distracting from the actual issue. Poverty, classism and the wealth gap are going to effect everyone.","22_2_3_1_1_1_1"

In terms of schools while I'm for school choice I'd agree it doesn't address underlying issues but I also dont think the usual idea of pouring more money into it does either. Providing a failed school district with more funds does not make it better, it's now just a well funded failed school district. Admittedly I'm not well versed enough on the various facets in play to propose better ideas but reevaluating teachers unions may be a start (and that goes for all unions for consistency). Of course when I say more funding doesnt solve anything I do not mean schools that are clearly lacking essential supplies.


I absolutely agree that to an extent everyone holds some degree of bias. Which is why I believe it's so important that groups who seek to change that bias do so through the correct avenues. The way we have seen things unfold does nothing but cause more division and as you said which I could not agree more with distracting from the real underlying issues. This is good for noone. 

I have never once thought as a generalization black communities are lazy or lacking values. When I see violent rioters, I believe they are lacking values. I understand the underlying sentiment but it is so far lost in translation. Shouting racism at everything or trying to make anyone who is white feel guilty for being simply being born white accomplishs nothing. Ignorance doesnt solve ignorance and discrimination does not solve discrimination. I'm far more likely to align myself and listen to any individual who despite potential challenges and hardship have a taken a level of personal responsibility to create the change they want to see by being law abiding citizens, working hard and overcoming obstacles to break bias. Unfortunately the media does not like to portray hard working Americans.

I do still believe though change needs to come from both sides, within the minds of Americans and from the black communities themselves. Completely ancedotal but my godfather who is black man, also a man whom I regard as a man of extreme character grew up in a lower income black neighborhood and still lives within his community to this day as a home owner. He has always told me one of the biggest challenges he had growing up was not neccesarily that of discrimination but from within his own community. Fleeing from gang violence, being physically threatened due to his refusal to be involved with gangs and so on. He made the choices to overcome the cycle and despite his surroundings made a respectable life for himself contributing to society as a firefighter. The plight of one whom overcomes adversity through hard work is always a message I can better relate to. Environments such as this must be fixed both from the outside and within.

As a nation we should always strive to be better, I just wish the message wasnt so muddled by further intolerance, anger and hatred and frankly stupidity that the real issues are left undiscussed. We get stuck spinning our wheels on race when in reality racism in it's TRUE sense does not explain most the issues communities face as they are present today. When we should be figuring out how we can fix broken systems that are failing the people at large.

The media is largely complicit in keeping us divided. I truly wish more civilized discussion could take place on actionable solutions.  

Anyhow thank you, I found this conversation thought provoking which is always beneficial in keeping myself grounded. It's easy these days to turn on the TV and let yourself become angry and at times misdirected.

Based on the research I've done, I believe that the issues black communities are facing are a combination of things. Racism, particularly in policy, have put black people at a disadvantage the effects of which we can see today. I also believe that bias, not necessarily racism, is impacting black people today, more than we realize. The past policies and current biases have led to an increased rate of poverty among black people that is worsening as the wealth gap increases and I think it's these two things that we need to address. 

Many of the statistics mentioned about increased crime, lack of education, more out of wedlock births etc. are found in low-income areas regardless of the makeup of the people living in the area. I feel that the reason these statistics appear to be higher in black communities is because the policies and actions of the past have accelerated the issues of poverty and the wealth gap for black communities. These issues are affecting all people in America, but we're noticing it in the black communities first because of this acceleration. 

I worry that looking at these issues solely through the lens of race is distracting from the root of the issue. Poverty, classism and the wealth gap are going to effect everyone and I believe that solving for those things, coupled with educational opportunities to learn how to recognize and overcome biases, is what will solve the issues we're seeing in black communities and prevent them from spreading to more Americans. By saying this I'm not trying to say that racism has been eradicated but I do think this is the path to a solution for the current problems.

Also 36% is not the same as being denied jobs, trying 36% harder is essential if people are to lift themselves from poverty.

Of course it is. Racist societies do not teach their children about systemic racism and the same goes for sexist societies. It's easy to see why. Teaching the truth about these things would be a direct threat to the status quo, so they aren't taught. If you never learn about systemic racism or sexism, then the status quo never has to worry about you fighting against them: you become an unconscious pawn in various systems of oppression through ignorance. Then you use your ignorance of the fact to claim the absence of the fact.","22_2_5_1_1_2_1"

It's common knowledge that America has a racial caste system that stretches back to its founding. It's also common knowledge that systemic racism exists in America. The Civil Rights Movement, and numerous Black and white scholars,  proved that obvious fact.

Just like this Reddit, they frog-in-boiling-water you with the idea that everything is already equal and racism is dead. Google ""gerrymandering"" for some systemic racism. How about suburbanites? In the late 1900s, black soldiers returning from WW2 were either straight up denied the benefits they served for (GI Bill, housing, respect from serving) and when they did get that sweet new house in Suburbia, real estate agents and disgruntled neighbors would start selling the nearby houses to only black people, creating segregated neighborhoods. This fueled the cycle of segregation in schools, lack of opportunity in the newly majority-black neighborhoods, and a normalizing if the cultural idea that black and white people could not share a community.

It is very difficult, if not impossible, to repair the damage done by those who desire to pervert the course of justice and convolute reason, when individuals do not believe any damage was done.

Compromising is counterproductive, as it requires sacrificing a correct course of action in exchange for a less correct or incorrect course of action. This strategy of compromising requires that no matter how extreme one party swings, the other party must compromise their position, regardless of where the current middle ground is perceived. 

The act of compromising does not reinforce the current perceived middle ground, this is a fallacy, but rather the act of compromising completely redefines the middle ground. Thus, with every compromise to the left, both parties are then pulled toward the left, and any reference to what was once perceived as the former middle ground is lost.","2_1_1_1_2_2_1_1"

99% percent of parents still do this. Once again the fucking democrats are kowtowing to the whims of a minority. A minority of less than 1% of 1%. Your parents just weren't a bunch of woketards, they were real parents that respected you for you.","1_1"

I shunned pink and girly things and told my parents I thought I shouldve been a boy. They rightly told me that was silly. I also really, really wanted to be a horse, but that didnt happen either lol. 

I think a lot of us girls went through that phase because we felt like we had to choose between being a girly-girl or doing cool boy stuff. When I matured a little and got over my not like other girls mindset, I grew out of the tomboy behavior and embraced more feminine things. I finally started wearing makeup and stuff in high school. Theres nothing wrong with a girl or woman never being into more feminine things like wearing makeup or dresses (I still go back and forth between getting all dolled up and just throwing on tshirt and jeans with a bare face) but it does not make that woman into a man. 

The way TRAs behave now only reinforces the strict gender roles and ideals of the past and they make gender and sex into a mockery and a costume to be worn. And I firmly believe theres no such thing as a transgender child, any decisions about assuming a different gender should not be made until after theyre fully adults. Hormone therapy, gender affirming therapy, etc. is all child abuse and I expect that in another decade well begin to see the real damage this trend will cause to thousands of kids. Thank god I was able to grow up and into myself without the pressures of social media and my parents and The Discourse^tm influencing all of it and being on display for all to see.","1_2"

&gt; WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court agreed Monday to hear challenges to the admissions process at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, presenting the most serious threat in decades to the use of affirmative action by the nation&amp;#039;s public and private colleges and universities.

&gt; The Supreme Court has long barred racial quotas in admissions.

&gt; If the Supreme Court did overrule its 2003 precedent, affirmative action programs would be in serious jeopardy nationwide.

I disagree that we should set quotas for immigration status for school attendance. Such regulations would be in direct violation of the free market and arbitrarily preventing private universities in particular the freedom of their own self-determination. A meritocracy is incomplete and farcical if it is regulated to deny talent.

The free market sometimes has to take a back seat to what is best for the nation.  Allowing our best universities to be attended by mostly foreign nationals (particularly in the STEM fields) just because the universities can charge them more hurts the US in terms of having fewer qualified US citizens to do the jobs here, and in making our geopolitical foes more capable.

Several of her arguments were based on this idea that the federal government should control all construction permitting everywhere.  She is saying that anyone who wants to build a home should have to call the army to come and check if their property is a wetland even if said property isn't connected in any way to a wetland.  And she gives presumptive guilt to land owners if they don't make such consultation under the reasoning that if a process exists, no matter how burdensome or opaque, then the land owner should known about it and go through it.  

Those aren't simple judicial disagreements.  Her arguments really are problematic on multiple levels and are flatly unintelligent.","3_1"

The solicitor for the EPA said this was possible and would be at no cost to the owner.

Her statement of what an owner should do is more a general statement that if you are making an investment in land it is assumed you would take the effort to verify the land you are purchasing. 

The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland. Chantell and Michael Sacket had recieved local permits, and started to build on it. That was back in 2007 which they were notified to stop building and contact the Army Corps of Engineers to obtain the necessary permits. They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

In 2012 the supreme court overturned that verdict. Back to the US District court, which they lost. It was determined they did fill the land without the appropriate permits. 

We are back in court to settle the standing of the Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which determine the scope and responsibility of a federal agencies actions. In 2006 another court case amended the precedence for how to apply the APA. Using that case as a foundation Sackets brought the case up again. And here we are.

A simplification of the history to now.

The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity. How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland? That is what the APA covers. Who and to what level are federal agencies required to notify the larger public. Would it be sufficient to offer a process to verify? That is the point she is making. Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify. Sackets are holding the side that it isn't them and really the local officials. Once they had the permit they were good to go. 

I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review. I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit. That stars with going to a community that has land available to use as you see fit. 

The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area. 

I am not a fan of someone building adjacent to where I hunt or fish. It can not be a free for all. They are from Spokane and found a beautiful lake.

It should never be assumed a land owner will participate in or even be aware of an opaque or overly burdensome process, which this is.  We are not going to go down the road of demanding everyone in the country call the army to find out if they can build their home.

&gt;The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland.

That's your opinion, and I vehemently disagree with it.  Even if that were the core issue of the case, you seem to presume that simply because someone says it is a wetland that it must be a wetland.  It is not.

&gt;They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

That in and of itself is rather ludicrous since they are the damaged party.  And that's a big part of what I was referencing earlier, the fact that Jackson and judges like her argue that the EPA's judgment is beyond reproach or appeal.  It's a ludicrous argument, and that judgment was rightly overturned.

&gt;The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity.

This touches on the core of my analysis of Jackson's arguments.  If the local permitting doesn't matter whatsoever and is made void by even an arbitrary or erroneous decisions from a federal bureaucracy, then the power of states and local governments to zone and construct is utterly null and void.  That is the start of a serious separation of powers debate.

&gt;How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland?

That is a very good question, and I think it speaks well of you that would ask it.  What I find problematic is that Jackson did **not** ask it and is blithely unconcerned by it.  She presumes the landowner's guilt with a dismissive ""shoulda known"" argument that ignores the fact that lawful governmental authority permitted the construction.  

&gt;Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify.

You are now making the same egregious argument Jackon makes.  The landowner contacted the government.  The government said it was okay to build and issued a permit.  There is no reasonable expectation that homeowner would know otherwise when the lawful governing authority certified the construction.  If there is a fault to be laid on anyone in that case, it is to be laid on the local government, not the landowner. 

&gt;I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review.

Nobody said it was.  What it being said, to put it in crude prose, is that Jackson showed her ass and brought her knowledge of law into serious question.  And she did.  She had several outbursts where she interrupted justices trying to ask their own questions of the litigants, and that is a serious breach of decorum in the high court.

&gt;I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit.

There we agree, and I also support the preservation of certain lands for environmental reasons.  But as you rightly pointed out, that's not really the issue brought up by this article.

&gt;The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area.

Colloquial use of the term is not the same as the legal or technical use of the term.  Advertising language is not binding or indicative of legal liability unless it is an intentional lie meant to deceive consumers.  

&gt;with all of that what was flatly unintelligent about her questions?

As I said previously in another reply, there are multiple unintelligent aspects to her comments.

First is the presumption of guilt she hoists on the landowner when the landowner received a certification from the government to construct.  This is beyond being an unreasonable argument.  It is unintelligent.  To hold anyone legally accountable you would have to prove they intended to flaunt the law, and that is literally impossible if they can produce a permit showing that the government authorized their actions.  

Secondly, she made reference to the issue of standing in such a way that, if she is to be literally interpreted, says the federal bureaucracy is beyond reproach or appeal and that their judgments are final.  It allows for no checks and balances on federal power or abuses whatsoever, and we all know that is a faulty argument on its face.  How she could think otherwise is a mystery... unless she's just that unintelligent.

Thirdly, she makes the argument that if any process exists, no matter how arbitrary or opaque, then the public is adequately serviced and the government is absolved of all responsibility or liability.  Again, there's more case law stating otherwise than one could possibly post on Reddit.  Just think about the implications of this for a moment.  If this were in fact the case, then how could Trump have ever been stopped from doing any of his administrative actions the way he was?  Take ending DACA, for example.  The courts have stated that there has to be a reasonable and clearly expressed process and ruleset for making decisions on such actions.  The government is not presumptively right in all of its judgments.  Jackson, though, seems to think otherwise, at least as far as the EPA is concerned.

The reason this case made it this far is precisely because of the multiple legal reasoning problems with it.  Multiple courts at this point have issued rulings that have serious and sometimes dubious legal problems.  That is not a problem necessarily with those courts.  It's a problem with the core legal reasonings behind the laws that establish and govern agencies like the EPA.  And now SCOTUS will hopefully clarify some of these issues.","3_1_1_1"

I touched on this particular aspect of her statements in another post.  It is troubling that she even thought that this was a valid line of questioning to begin with.  The litigants have in hand a permit issued by the local government.  At that point, whether or not it is a wetland is immaterial.  They literally went to the government and got approval to build.  It is not on the landowner to settle disagreements the government has with itself.

She made several assertions in her arguments that were factually wrong and even a couple that are legally dubious.  Granted, we are not in the courtroom and can't hear everything she said in its full context.

The crux of her argument was this.  If it was somehow possible for you to find out if a puddle in your yard was a wetland, no matter how hidden or convoluted that method may be, then the government should go after you with the full force of the law for not figuring it out.

I mean, this doesn't even make sense on the most basic level.  This is over land plots that are disconnected from wetlands, not waterways themselves.  We're not talking rivers, swamps, ponds, lakes, etc.  We're talking about a residential property on the other side of a highway from a waterway that has no water on it unless it rains and makes a puddle.  The EPA tried to claim it to be ""wetlands"" and prohibited any kind of construction on it.  And here Jackson is saying that the EPA shouldn't have its judgment questioned at all and that the property owner should go to jail for not assuming that a property within an unknown distance of water was potentially a wetland.

She made an absolutely unintelligible argument that is wholly inconsistent with the law and did so repeatedly never tweaking or even clarififying that argument. Instead, she just repeatedly interrupted the other justices to essentially say the EPA cannot be questioned and cannot be wrong in their judgment. 

Let me just lay out really quick why her argument is so puzzling and so horrendously ignorant.  Construction permits are handled locally, not federally.  But the EPA inserted itself into the process in some places by claiming lands that are not connected to wetlands at all fall under their jurisdiction and cannot be used for any construction purposes.  This specific case centers around a plot of land on the other side of a highway from a waterway.  It's not a wetland.  It has no water on it at all and is not in any way connected to a waterway.  It was zoned for residential use.

Now, Jackson says the property owner should have known or sought out a process to find out if the land was a wetland.  Again, there's no water on this land, and it is separated from waterways by a major highway.  There's no reasonable thought process for anyone to believe it would be a wetland.  But she says that since you can call... the army... that you are expected to call for **any** construction project anywhere and that if you don't you should be jailed.  

Now, this is unintelligent for multiple reasons.  First, it means that the federal government now holds the power of permitting over all land and that everyone everywhere has to consult... the military... to undergo construction projects.  That alone is a violation of the separation of powers between the state and federal governments.  Secondly, it means that there is a presumption of guilt on the part of land owners as there is no appeal process for the EPA's judgment, even in a case as ridiculous as this.  Jackson says no, if the EPA says it, you go to jail.  Thirdly, and most idiotic, is her argument that no matter how opaque a process may be, the fact that one exists at all in any form absolved the government of any fault whatsoever.  

These are just terrible legal arguments that a first year law student would see problems with and wouldn't dare attempt.  But she was so brazenly confident in these arguments that she thought it appropriate to talk over the other justices as they asked questions of the litigants.  She really caused a lot of head scratching with these little outbursts.  It seems in its face like an argument for total supremacy for all levels of federal bureaucracy.  That's not a smart case to make given the structure of our country.","8_1"

Yes permits are local, but when it comes to waters of the US, that is a federal issue that is managed by the EPA and army corps, who issue permits for anything around fill material and dredge around navigate or waters, which the court has ruled to include wetlands that are adjacent to navigable waters.

Affirmative action was a necessary part but now I feel it's just too heavily applied at the detriment of everyone involved.  The ones it's supposed to help, it hurts, because it sets them up for failure in the workforce because they didn't (necessarily) have to work as hard as their peers to get there.  And for everyone else it hurts them because they may be more qualified but get passed over because it's better to hire a minority with slightly less qualifications.

I'm all for giving people an equal shot, but it needs to BE equal.  And I'm fully aware that it is overwhelmingly difficult to ""get out of the ghetto"".  But I think that is more to do with the war on drugs' systemic racism than employers not wanting to hire black people. 

Now let's discuss the article

&gt;  If we are admitting more black students, Latino students, and female students, the assumption is that fewer white, Asian, and male students are being admitted into college all across the country

There was an interesting study recently discussing how there are far more women completing college than men I'll see if I can find it (on mobile).  In it, it showed while men and women have been entering college around the same rate, women are more likely to compete it.  One of the suggested reasons for this is it far easier for a minority to get a scholarship these days than a white male.

Now, I can't say I agree that affirmative action started out a reparations for Jim Crow laws, to be frank I actually think affirmative action really did help people at the beginning.  But these days, I can't say that it's as necessary as it was and the longer it sticks around the more and more it is quickly becoming reparations instead of just trying to give people an equal shot.  


Honestly, I think it's more about criminal justice reform and dealing with the war on drugs in a different manner than employment BTMO.","1"

Personally, I think the problem is that when it was enacted certain minority groups had a more difficult time obtaining a good education and good career than their white counterpart due to institutionalize racism, etc. However, I dont think that the difficulties were the same then as they are now and when its still applied so broadly its no longer as beneficial. For example, there are blacks and hispanics who come from affluent enough families where they may not need to benefit from it but do. And at the other end you have whites born to poverty who face similar challenges and don't have similar help. 

I do agree that we should be trying to address the root of the problem, like ending the war on drugs, rather than trying to fix it at the back end. As partisan as the two parties are though, I really don't see this being addressed anytime soon.

But when you look at the actual policy of affirmative action, and the way colleges implement it, it doesn't strictly matter *how many* minorities are wealthy; they're going to benefit either way (with a few notable demographic exceptions). 

So insofar as blacks are poorer than the rest of America, AA helps. But why wouldn't we adjust the policy to actually correct for wealth, regardless of race?

Also, as a side-note, there are conservative arguments in support of reparations.  I recommend [this take](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/millman/taking-reparations-seriously/).

All that said, I am personally skeptical of affirmative action as a good way to achieve racial equality (or implement reparations if that's something you want to do).  I've seen affirmative action abused in a particularly harmful way: contracts given to ""minority-owned"" businesses that are run by super-wealthy members of racial minorities who are relatively recent immigrants from foreign countries, where they were part of those countries' elites...competing against, taking these contracts away from locally-owned businesses that could be providing those same services, and that are probably more likely to actually employ and/or be owned by racial minorities of lower to modest socioeconomic status.","2_1"

Examples:

* We could work to eliminate racially-charged Gerrymandering in the south, especially Mississippi, but also states like North Carolina.   This might attract more black voters to the GOP.  White racism in the deep south is a scourge to society and I think it's particularly disturbing and shameful that in some localities the GOP has allowed Democrats to ""own"" the anti-racist efforts.  There are black conservatives and as soon as we start stepping up and thoroughly rooting out racism, we're going to start appealing to them.
* We could work to address inequalities in school funding that disenfranchise black people.  In some states, such as Ohio, these even pose constitutional problems, with the state constitution.  The typical setup is that a black district has a weaker tax base so it faces higher tax rates but lower tax revenues.  I'm not 100% sure what the best fix would be, but some sort of equalizing of funding at the state level might help.  I think this is a conservative issue because the racial wealth disparities often go hand-in-hand with astronomical local tax rates.  These rates are something that I think any conservative would care about or be troubled by, if they knew about them.  In some cases, black communities are plagued by greater corruption in municipal government: addressing this corruption could directly help these communities, helping them to lower tax rates as their funds are better used.
* Restructuring the tax code so as to increase wealth mobility could go a long way to helping to erase past power disparities that have been passed down through generations.  This is why, in spite of agreeing with *most* of the proposed tax reforms that libertarians and conseratives advocate (moving away from income tax, hugely simplifying the tax code, lowering tax across the board, shifting more towards consumption-based taxes and use taxes), I still support progressive taxation and estate tax.
* Doing something to address police brutality might be good too.  Police violence against unarmed people disproportionately affects black and hispanic people in the U.S., and they're a key issue in particular that the black community cares about...look at how it's a focus of the black lives matter movement.  I think there is a lot of common ground for conservatives to share concern with the police brutality issues affecting black people: a lot of these cases have to do with police over-reaction to legal gun ownership, like the [Philando Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Philando_Castile) case.  There are examples of successful reforms to address these issues, Dallas, TX ([source](http://www.pressherald.com/2016/07/09/dallas-took-action-to-reform-police-force/)) is a particularly good one.  [Here is a general piece](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/252969-calling-all-mayors-this-is-what-police-reform-should-look) with some recommendations.

I think if we started taking racial issues more seriously, we would have more political capital for eliminating affirmative action.  And I personally think this would be hugely beneficial: affirmative action is problematic on many levels.  It can be abused, and it can create or reinforce a perception of racial minorities as being less competent than their white coworkers or peers.  I think it would be strongly preferable for us to address racial power and economic disparities through other means.  But there are serious inequalities, and I think merely calling to remove affirmative action without addressing the deeper problems is politically infeasible, and is likely to feed into the stereotype of Republicans being racist and not caring about racial minorities.

I want us to step up and start addressing these problems.  We can best prove that we care about racial minorities by successfully addressing the issues disproportionately affecting their communities.","4"

&gt; His poor performance in office reinforces the view of those who think that he made it to the White House because his race provided him with an advantage that offset his lack of qualifications

The thing is, from an objective point of view, he's done quite well in office.  He's achieved a lot.  Granted, most of what he's achieved hasn't been good for the country, and a lot of it has been anything but what he campaigned on - but you can't say much different about most presidents.

I think he's achieved a lot of his actual agenda (which is different than the campaign promises he made).  Heck, he even managed to get a national healthcare plan that most Americans don't want passed (never mind that pesky Constitution).  We'll see a lot more of his actual agenda if he wins a second term, since he won't have to worry about re-election then.  

He's also been very good at controlling the media by controlling access (if you don't toe the line, you don't get access), and he's got a top notch spin team across the whole government.  If he thought it helped his re-election campaign, your house could be on fire and he'd be able to produce charts from government departments that proved why that was a good thing (just don't look too hard at the numbers).

The only thing preventing him from being a shoo-in in November is the poor economic numbers - and he's got government departments doing everything they can to convince people that it is a good thing that people are leaving the workforce in unprecedented numbers yet the employment rate isn't changing, and that the national debt is 50% higher than when he took office.

His re-election hinges on Americans believing the economy is improving - and he's in a unique position to make that happen (at least in the extreme short term before the election - never mind about what happens in the long term, he won't be running for office then).  

*If you want to let your inner paranoid play for a bit, you can even imagine that he's planning for the coming financial collapse to happen during his second term, so that he can declare a national emergency and postpone elections in 2016.*

So on that basis, its really hard to say his performance has been poor.  It just hasn't been good for the country.","1"

It's more than this though - the media have adored him since day 1 and protect him just like they protected Clinton except magnify that.

Sad but true. The novelty factor of his racial status is a big factor here. A presidential candidate with a *complete and utter lack of meaningful experience* would have been laughed at if he/she were white - hell Palin got and still gets tons of flak and she even had govt experience.

It was, though. It was pure novelty - I'd be thrilled to vote for a black conservative too, so I can understand where they are coming from. 

But regarding your friends I'm surprised - the left is really big on accusing the right of racism being the factor behind dislike of Obama, whereas the right only brings up race to point out the fact that we elected someone with zero experience running *anything* because of race.

No, he is considered black.

Half-white/half-minority people are only considered 'white' when they do something wrong - ie. George Zimmerman. Otherwise they are called black/hispanic/whatever.

I don't thinks it's racist for you to talk about his race, and I never said it was, but I consider that your position won't gain much empathy, assuming you're white. You can hold me to the same standard because I am white. I am also an independent voter who has no choice but to put up with both the Republicans' and the Democrats' shit in order to get my viewpoint across, and trust me, I get pissed whenever Democrats pull the racist card against Republicans.

To clarify myself, I don't think this rhetoric, largely shared by Republicans and independent conservatives, that ""Obama only got elected because he's black"", is *racist*. What this says is that everything sucks about Obama *except* that he's black. The reason that I'm offended by this statement is because the largest voting group in the U.S. is independents, most of whom found a good reason to vote for Obama, and whose goal is not to take down the Republicans whenever they can. And by saying that all of these people supported Obama without reading his books, examining his character, or watching him during his campaign, you are not insulting black voters, but anyone who supports Obama for what kind of man he is inside.

I think you can talk objectively about him being black, but I don't think your analysis is free from dislike for Obama's policies, and therefore is not objective. I'm certain that his race had in impact on the election in that it has had an impact on who he is. Character is what really defines an election, not experience or qualification. We elect people who appear to have reached a high level of self actualization. It's well known, if not easily inferred that Obama has had struggles with his identity, which propelled him into having to find answers to deep questions of self from a unusually early age. I've seen videos of him from Harvard 20 years ago, and there's an eerie feeling even then that would be president, which is the same case for a lot of presidents, and it's a personality thing. Objectively, whatever path he has been lead on (in his case, his racial struggles and lack of a father figure; in Reagan's case, being a Hollywood actor and a Democrat; in Bush's case, being an alcoholic to a born-again Christian, and so on), has granted him some spiritual wisdom. In other words, he seems like a really nice, likable gentleman (maybe not to you, but that's beside the point). With this, he gained the respect of a lot of people before his campaign, before he was scripted or had teleprompters, who were actually the ones who pressured him into running before he had finished his term as senator, which perhaps he ought not to have. This could also be because the Democrats had no one better to run, but that says more about the National Democratic Party than about the majority of voters. The fact about his campaign is that it alone inspired a movement of altruism and political efficacy, and he has been a role model for the black community, and another fact is that it did not increase membership in the Democratic party, which is actually on the decline. Whether all Obama supporters are misguided is a matter of opinion. I'm not endorsing his policies, because like you I have real hold-ups about many of them; this should go beyond political belief. So, while I have to respect all opinions, it is absurd, both rhetorically and politically, to blame his *entire* election on the electorate's will to have a black president. And in this election, now that we've already elected a black president, who now has a substantial presidential resume, we have a lot more to talk about than that. I'd be interested to read a rebuttal to my sentiments, and you can match me in length if necessary.

* When I say Obama won because of his race I don't mean every single person voted for him exclusively based on that. What I mean is that he won the election - persuaded a lot of additional voters needed to swing it in his favor - because of the novelty in electing a first black president. I say this because, like many other white people, I see the appeal in being able to 'prove' that I'm not racist by supporting a black man (in my case it was Herman Caine).

* This novelty factor is what allowed him to become president with his severe lack of experience in any kind of official governing position, which would otherwise cripple other candidates

* His race also required his opponents to walk on egg-shells with attacks lest they be seen as racist. Too much aggression would be seen as 'white man keeping a black man down'

(some supporting evidence not directly tied to the election, but relevant)

Additionally, the sheer adoration of Obama by the media was partly due to the celebration of electing a black man. For quite some time he was literally seen as the messiah - which there isn't anything inherently wrong with except for the fact that he *hadn't even done anything yet*. He won a freakin' nobel prize without having done anything yet. I just can't see any of those things happening to a white man, no matter what political party he was affiliated with.

Lastly, Obama is half white. We never hear about this - he is referred to as black. George Zimmerman, the guy that shot Trayvon Martin, was also half white and half hispanic. He isn't referred to as hispanic - he was referred to, initially, as white...and then later 'white-hispanic' once the media had been corrected. I only bring this up to further illustrate the obsession with propping up minorities and demonizing white people in leftwing politics.","2_1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1_1"

For example, a student who would perform solidly well in a state school gets accepted into a much more rigorous school for which they are unsuited, and then proceed to fail out of. 

I see the Obama presidency in very much the same light. There is no way that a white person, whose only qualifications amounted to a 1/2 term in the Senate and holding the position of ""Community Organizer"", would have been placed in the position of running the country. A person like that is just simply unprepared for the job. They have no experience, and no track record. 

Very predictably, we end up with the mess that we see today. ","3"

Precisely - the novelty factor played into the last election big time, and continues to play into it (with the addition of so many sources of media projecting his greatness like propaganda).

You also have to realize that Obama isn't the driving force behind his own success - he was picked, groomed, and hoisted by the leftwing machine - and they were very effective at it. ","3_1"
