"2023-05-28",1685300661,"How are Asians treated in America?"," Apologies if I come across as ignorant, but as a Chinese Indonesian studying in America, I've always gotten the impression that Asian Americans (AA) have always been historically treated as second class citizens. Although thankfully, the interactions I've had with society have been 99% of the time pleasant and cordial, I've always noticed that AAs are always screwed over by entities and policies that are sometimes even designed to curb discrimination. I've always for some unknown reason feel that, just us Asians in general need to do a great deal to ""prove"" ourselves before society can accept us. I don't know if I'm too indulgent on victim mentality but allow me to cite a few examples off the top of my head:

1. Harvard's taking of affirmative-action to the extreme where a lot of AAs are singled out
2. Not enough pushback from people and governmental entities for crimes committed against AAs
3. Not enough coverage from MSM for racially motivated crimes against AAs
4. With relation to point 1, the fact that AA are no longer on the list of ""diversity quotas"" companies and colleges have to fulfill.

On the other side of the camp, you have actual AAs speaking very positively about their experience being American, and how they feel accepted and very much loved by the community. I've only heard bits and pieces from both sides so far, so I'd very much like to know what it's like to live as an AA because I don't know what to believe. Any input or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated.","asian",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asian/comments/13u8a96/how_are_asians_treated_in_america/"

I'm asking because there's a case pending at the scotus that may overturn affirmative action. The case was brought by a group of Asian Americans.

I'm Japanese and support affirmative action.

But I'm curious if most asian Americans support affirmative action","asian",28,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asian/comments/14ix2za/do_you_support_affirmative_action_asianamericans/"
