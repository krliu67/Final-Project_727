So we'll see how that last bit from Robert's ruling will actually be enforced.

Given how powerful and resourceful Harvard is, unless they get taken to court repeatedly and lose repeatedly in the future, their admissions can just do away with test scores entirely and weigh essays a lot more to still try and attain the level of racial balancing/diversity they want to attain.

This case directly affects 0.001% of the population, but the fact that Harvard reinforces a stereotype in its admissions process, plus the fact that this is now well documented and publicized, make it also about representation for the rest of the population (in addition to admissions fairness for the 0.001%).","2_2"

It's certainly true that at each ""top-tier"" school, there is a wide spectrum of talent, merit, etc., to the point that it is difficult to make generalizations based on someone's alma mater. The fact that the admissions process is often non-transparent makes it even more difficult.

But just because an Asian guy can be in every way more excellent than a Harvard graduate does not mean that this same guy (or his probably Asian children) should not protest a system that blatantly discriminates against his race.

You may be suggesting that since we all know the discrimination exists, any evaluator, recruiter, or anyone can essentially attribute a ""discrimination premium"" to Asian Americans relative to their educational credentials. I think that may be true to an extent. But I am not sure how beneficial this premium truly is vs. a fairer and more transparent admissions process.","2_2_1_1"

Harvard conducted an internal investigation into its admissions policies in 2013 and found a bias against Asian-American applicants. But Harvard never made the findings public or acted on them.

What crap is going on in Harvard College? There is deep animosity against East Asians, Chinese and Indians coming to Harvard and studying there.

I think that's kind of the rub,  the idea of *disproportionately* getting in if they are doing the best based on any given metric but are excluded due to the color of their skin. e.g., we would hope someone wouldn't be excluded from say, a sports team because we want the team to have specific proportions of ethnicity. It's arguably regressive and very hard to defend when metrics are right there.

If you remove the checkbox for race you have names, and even if you had some sort of blind admissions things would likelier be much *more* disproportionate because you'd be going by standardized metrics some are doing much better on. You could intentionally use metrics that aren't quantifiable and open to complete interpretation by say, the interviewer, but for a variety of reasons that isn't realistic and even a Kennedy School grad would struggle to defend it even if they'd enjoy trying.

There aren't great solutions when you're trying to weigh quantifiable metrics vs ideological outcomes and notions of fairness and starting points and it's difficult for people not to put their hand on the scale. Perhaps we'll see weighted metrics than can be pointed to, e.g., standardized test scores weighted by SES , or where a \~4.0 GPA from a wealthier family is considered a 3.5.","4_4_4_1"

This is a decent idea but it probably won't resolve the conflict - take a look at a recent attempt by boston public schools to implement this for their exam school admissions. People are big mad about that one.

Personally I think the problem is that we are here arguing about policy, but at the end of the day, policy is just the tool for achieving a desired undergraduate class composition. The thing that people disagree about the most, as you mentioned, is the proportions of that composition. 

Anti-affirmative action people think the school should admit more Asians, or more white people. Pro-affirmative action people think the school should continue to admit more of other POC groups than might otherwise get in. You can change the policy to anything you want, but these two groups will always be at odds, because they fundamentally disagree on what the ""correct"" proportions are. Their underlying reasons for holding these opinions, whether that is social justice, racism, self-interest, or something else, are really unlikely to change. I would be *very* surprised if there was a proportion that would make both sides happy. 

So if we implement a policy where scores are weighted by SES, either the weighting will be significant enough to move the needle on admissions, in which case the anti-affirmative action group will be unhappy, OR the weighting will not really matter, and the pro-affirmative action group will be unhappy. We will be arguing about this forever.","4_4_4_1_1"

We generally agree, but I take issue here. While that may be a byproduct, their goal is generally not to be discriminated against based on the color of their skin or where their ancestors were born. They view many of these things as akin to the history of blatant anti-antisemitism and policies designed to keep Jews out of the ivies by doing away with quantifiable metrics, which then became applied to them.

e.g., [for a long, long time if you passed the exams you were admitted](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/2007_asq_karabel.pdf) \-- people from ""undesirable"" backgrounds generally either couldn't afford it or had no idea how to even go about applying. After the war this changed with Columbia seeing 40% of their new class was jewish and here at H we saw 20-30%. Hence, the first admissions systems in 1910 where they started looking at other aspects like letters from headmasters, athletic ability, *geographic* diversity (bad apples aren't likely to have houses in Montana!), and arguably the two more important: whether you were the son of a legacy or what your religion was, ancestry and whether your family name had changed.

At the time exclusion based on ethnicity was considered idiotic by much of the faculty and others, so it generally wasn't advertised but it was there. ""Character"" marks was basically protestant (woe be to catholics). Yale was known to limit Jews to 10-12% of each incoming class.

Into the 60s and 70s admissions expanded but the systems were still there, except now they were also being applied to people of asian ethnicity to minimize their numbers. A Federal probe in the 1990s sparked by their limiting asians basically said Harvard didn't have a policy to exclude asians, they were just getting swept up in their ""holistic policies"" originally designed to exclude jews. e.g., we couldn't have the student body be ""too intellectual"" -- another code word for jewish -- and hence needed to be ""holistic."" When you see people saying ""holistic"" this is where it comes from and what it denotes.

For further reading on this (I'm barely scratching the surface of the backroom conversations we know about to deal with ""the problem"") I'd recommend *The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Jerome Karabel who's an H grad over at Berkeley, or *The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Marcia Synott.","4_4_4_1_1_1"

It actually isn't. Even here right next to Cambridge, Boston's per-pupil spending is the highest in the nation at $31,400 per pupil (up from $27k) and it's schools generally rank in the bottom of the state. MA as a whole generally does great in test score rankings, but Boston Public Schools do not.

Hence, the first admissions systems in 1910 where they started looking at other aspects like letters from headmaster letters, athletic ability, \*geographic\* diversity (less likely to be a jew if from Wyoming), and arguably the two more important: whether you were the son of a legacy or what your religion was, ancestry and whether your family name had changed.

All these new things got added to forms and we had an office to go through them. We know based on correspondence this was not about numbers -- but it was the birth of ""holistic"" admissions.

At the time exclusion based on ethnicity was considered stupid and wrong by much of the faculty and others, so it generally wasn't advertised but it was very much there. ""Character"" marks was basically protestant (woe be to catholics) and codewords bloomed -- Yale was known to limit Jews to 10-12% of each incoming class.

Into the 60s and 70s admissions expanded but the systems were still there, except now they were also being applied to people of asian ethnicity limiting their numbers. A Federal probe in the 1990s sparked by their limiting asian enrollment basically said Harvard didn't have a policy to exclude asians, they were just getting swept up in their ""holistic policies"" originally designed to exclude jews. e.g., we couldn't have the student body be ""too intellectual"" -- another code word for jewish -- and hence needed to be ""holistic.""

When you see people saying ""holistic"" this is where it comes from and what it denotes.

For further reading on this (I'm barely scratching the surface of the backroom conversations we know about to deal with ""the problem"") I'd recommend *The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Jerome Karabel who's an H grad over at Berkeley, and/or *The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Marcia Synott.","7_1_1_2"

California as a state removed Affirmative Action through referendum somewhere in 1996. So if you see all UC campuses, Asians are majority in demographics be it UCB, UCLA and so on....

There are few other states where Affirmative Action has been removed voluntarily, like Michigan and others.

This is worked in states. Where merit matters, Whites and Blacks have not caught up with Asians.

Anyways, the 21st century belongs to Asians and Asia - China and India. Be prepared.","15_1"

As if these facts werent bad enough, Harvard specifically rejected alternative, race-blind formulations that could have achieved comparable student diversity. As Justice Neil Gorsuch notes in his concurrence, the plaintiffs in the case submitted evidence that Harvard could nearly replicate the current racial composition of its student body without resorting to race-based practices, if it gave socioeconomically disadvantaged students just half the advantage it gave recruited athletes and if it eliminated preferences for the children of donors, alumni, and faculty.

Second, poor students are less likely to become future donors that the school can draw from for financial support. Therefore, there's no incentive for them to do so. 

Third, and most importantly, the whole point of going to Harvard and similar schools is to surround yourself with the wealthy elite. Low-income students benefit by meeting these kids, being brought into their circles, and forming life-long connections with them.

On the other hand, other forms of admissions preference like legacy admissions serve a valid institutional purpose, like ensuring that alumni remain loyal (which is really a rather reasonable thing for a university to want). Or you can look at athletics admissions which also tend to build loyalty and attract future donations. Harvard decided a long time ago (early 20th century) to abandon mere academic merit as a qualification for admission, and its never really been about seeking equality.

Rather, its always been a concentration of wealth and power that tries to use its resources to do good in society (enriching knowledge through research, shaping leaders for society, etc). Stuff like that is what makes makes the university what it is- selectivity, prestige, power. Affirmative action was really only window dressing, and Id argue it largely benefitted the wealthier non-white applicants anyway, not the ones that really need such a boost.

They had to work hard as hell to earn their degree.  Harvard is infamous for the fact that you can coast along for 4 years and earn honors thanks to grade inflation, a relic of the Vietnam war era where they inflated grades to keep their kids out of the draft.  That is a fact.  Someone should tell Harvard that the Vietnam war ended a while ago and there is no draft anymore, btw.  Harvard's reputation is undeserved.  Another example is Cornell where their program is so rigorous that they have a suicide problem.

Harvard is so god damned pathetic that they had a massive cheating scandal on a TAKE HOME TEST for a pathetic class that's basically an easy fucking A where 70% of the class was caught cheating:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Harvard_cheating_scandal

*Government 1310: ""Introduction to Congress"" was led by assistant professor Matthew B. Platt in Spring 2010, 2011, and 2012.[10] The course was offered to students of Harvard College and Harvard Extension School.[11][12][13] It developed a reputation as an easy course, **receiving a high proportion of ""easy"" or ""very easy"" ratings in the Q Guide**, Harvard's collection of course evaluations.*

Best and brightest, folks.

Harvard kids are so god damned lazy (and possibly stupid), they have to cheat on an easy fucking A.  

One wonders how many Jared Kushners get admitted to the school.  Google ""Harvard Z-list"".  Corrupt to its core.","1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

The 2012 Harvard cheating scandal involved approximately 125 Harvard University students who were investigated for cheating on the take-home final examination of the spring 2012 edition of Government 1310: ""Introduction to Congress"". Harvard announced the investigation publicly on August 30, 2012. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris described the case as ""unprecedented in its scope and magnitude"". The Harvard Crimson ranked the scandal as the news story most important to Harvard in 2012.A teaching fellow noticed similarities between a small number of exams during grading in May 2012.

Kahlenberg shows that pure SES based AA would maintain, if not increase, URM enrollment but that's based on increasing latino numbers while black numbers would fall.

&amp;#x200B;

After reviewing much of the literature, this isn't a URM issue. It is specifically an issue of black representation.

Alternatives to AA:

1. drop legacy
2. reduce the premium put on athletes. Shift more of the team mix to walk-on.
3. give a large boost to income and wealth deficient applicants and then couple that with hiring more admissions staff who are in those communities across the country identifying these kids and getting them to apply. ","4"

I think that's kind of the rub,  the idea of *disproportionately* getting in if they are doing the best based on any given metric but are excluded due to the color of their skin. e.g., we would hope someone wouldn't be excluded from say, a sports team because we want the team to have specific proportions of ethnicity. It's arguably regressive and very hard to defend when metrics are right there.

If you remove the checkbox for race you have names, and even if you had some sort of blind admissions things would likelier be much *more* disproportionate because you'd be going by standardized metrics some are doing much better on. You could intentionally use metrics that aren't quantifiable and open to complete interpretation by say, the interviewer, but for a variety of reasons that isn't realistic and even a Kennedy School grad would struggle to defend it even if they'd enjoy trying.

There aren't great solutions when you're trying to weigh quantifiable metrics vs ideological outcomes and notions of fairness and starting points and it's difficult for people not to put their hand on the scale. Perhaps we'll see weighted metrics than can be pointed to, e.g., standardized test scores weighted by SES , or where a \~4.0 GPA from a wealthier family is considered a 3.5.","4_4_4_1"

This is a decent idea but it probably won't resolve the conflict - take a look at a recent attempt by boston public schools to implement this for their exam school admissions. People are big mad about that one.

Personally I think the problem is that we are here arguing about policy, but at the end of the day, policy is just the tool for achieving a desired undergraduate class composition. The thing that people disagree about the most, as you mentioned, is the proportions of that composition. 

Anti-affirmative action people think the school should admit more Asians, or more white people. Pro-affirmative action people think the school should continue to admit more of other POC groups than might otherwise get in. You can change the policy to anything you want, but these two groups will always be at odds, because they fundamentally disagree on what the ""correct"" proportions are. Their underlying reasons for holding these opinions, whether that is social justice, racism, self-interest, or something else, are really unlikely to change. I would be *very* surprised if there was a proportion that would make both sides happy. 

So if we implement a policy where scores are weighted by SES, either the weighting will be significant enough to move the needle on admissions, in which case the anti-affirmative action group will be unhappy, OR the weighting will not really matter, and the pro-affirmative action group will be unhappy. We will be arguing about this forever.","4_4_4_1_1"

We generally agree, but I take issue here. While that may be a byproduct, their goal is generally not to be discriminated against based on the color of their skin or where their ancestors were born. They view many of these things as akin to the history of blatant anti-antisemitism and policies designed to keep Jews out of the ivies by doing away with quantifiable metrics, which then became applied to them.

e.g., [for a long, long time if you passed the exams you were admitted](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/2007_asq_karabel.pdf) \-- people from ""undesirable"" backgrounds generally either couldn't afford it or had no idea how to even go about applying. After the war this changed with Columbia seeing 40% of their new class was jewish and here at H we saw 20-30%. Hence, the first admissions systems in 1910 where they started looking at other aspects like letters from headmasters, athletic ability, *geographic* diversity (bad apples aren't likely to have houses in Montana!), and arguably the two more important: whether you were the son of a legacy or what your religion was, ancestry and whether your family name had changed.

At the time exclusion based on ethnicity was considered idiotic by much of the faculty and others, so it generally wasn't advertised but it was there. ""Character"" marks was basically protestant (woe be to catholics). Yale was known to limit Jews to 10-12% of each incoming class.

Into the 60s and 70s admissions expanded but the systems were still there, except now they were also being applied to people of asian ethnicity to minimize their numbers. A Federal probe in the 1990s sparked by their limiting asians basically said Harvard didn't have a policy to exclude asians, they were just getting swept up in their ""holistic policies"" originally designed to exclude jews. e.g., we couldn't have the student body be ""too intellectual"" -- another code word for jewish -- and hence needed to be ""holistic."" When you see people saying ""holistic"" this is where it comes from and what it denotes.

For further reading on this (I'm barely scratching the surface of the backroom conversations we know about to deal with ""the problem"") I'd recommend *The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Jerome Karabel who's an H grad over at Berkeley, or *The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Marcia Synott.","4_4_4_1_1_1"

&gt;AA based on socioeconomic status or per-pupil spending in the sending secondary school would be an even more effective and robust way to uncover academically talented students than AA based on race. The reason Harvard doesnt do this is that it is not actually optimizing for academic talent, but for alumni donations

Interesting, I guess I'd wonder by what mechanism?

It actually isn't. Even here right next to Cambridge, Boston's per-pupil spending is the highest in the nation at $31,400 per pupil (up from $27k) and it's schools generally rank in the bottom of the state. MA as a whole generally does great in test score rankings, but Boston Public Schools do not.

I'm not sure if you're aware of [the 2020 report](https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2020/03/BPS-Comprehensive-District-Review-Report-March-2020-Final.pdf) that basically laid bare just how poorly many of them were doing, and there's serious talk about it going into receivership with a state takeover. One of the major issues is chronic absenteeism (absent more than 10% of the year), and you'll want to look at page 28's chart to have a better idea as to how this is playing out by ethnicity between 2018-2019.","6_5_1_1_1_1_1_1"

I'm going to assume you aren't here in Cambridge, but ""character"" used to be code for white protestant when it came to admissions in order to accept people who were less capable but favored over other groups. Originally, [everyone who passed the exams was admitted](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/2007_asq_karabel.pdf)\-- people from ""undesirable"" backgrounds generally either couldn't afford it or had no idea how to even go about applying.

After the war this changed with Columbia seeing 40% of their new class was jewish and here at H we saw 20-30%. Hence, the first admissions systems in 1910 where they started looking at other aspects like letters from headmaster letters, athletic ability, \*geographic\* diversity (less likely to be a jew if from Wyoming), and arguably the two more important: whether you were the son of a legacy or what your religion was, ancestry and whether your family name had changed.

All these new things got added to forms and we had an office to go through them. We know based on correspondence this was not about numbers -- but it was the birth of ""holistic"" admissions.

At the time exclusion based on ethnicity was considered stupid and wrong by much of the faculty and others, so it generally wasn't advertised but it was very much there. ""Character"" marks was basically protestant (woe be to catholics) and codewords bloomed -- Yale was known to limit Jews to 10-12% of each incoming class.

Into the 60s and 70s admissions expanded but the systems were still there, except now they were also being applied to people of asian ethnicity limiting their numbers. A Federal probe in the 1990s sparked by their limiting asian enrollment basically said Harvard didn't have a policy to exclude asians, they were just getting swept up in their ""holistic policies"" originally designed to exclude jews. e.g., we couldn't have the student body be ""too intellectual"" -- another code word for jewish -- and hence needed to be ""holistic.""

When you see people saying ""holistic"" this is where it comes from and what it denotes.

For further reading on this (I'm barely scratching the surface of the backroom conversations we know about to deal with ""the problem"") I'd recommend *The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admission and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Jerome Karabel who's an H grad over at Berkeley, and/or *The Half-Opened Door: Discrimination and Admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton* by Marcia Synott.","7_1_1_2"

California as a state removed Affirmative Action through referendum somewhere in 1996. So if you see all UC campuses, Asians are majority in demographics be it UCB, UCLA and so on....

There are few other states where Affirmative Action has been removed voluntarily, like Michigan and others.

Stuff like that is what makes makes the university what it is- selectivity, prestige, power. Affirmative action was really only window dressing, and Id argue it largely benefitted the wealthier non-white applicants anyway, not the ones that really need such a boost. Harvard isnt trying to be some social engine that elevates people from disadvantaged backgrounds on the basis of merit but is trying to attract the right mix of people that will allow it to perpetuate its power and prestige.","7"

i.e., If you're a proponent of AA it's difficult when it's pointed out it's more likely to benefit a wealthy student from overseas than someone from Roxbury or Lawrence, and we know we have a real issue with it being used against Asian Americans. There are more, but it becomes difficult to rabidly argue for something that actively harms people due to their skin color or nationality when they're doing everything right.

Measuring test scores and GPAs for admissions is NOT merit based.

Minority students are not simply being gifted admissions. They have to meet the same requirements to be considered to begin with. Statistically, it is likely due to the racial wealth gap and racial inequality, that they have clearly demonstrated ability beyond any merit required.

The 2012 Harvard cheating scandal involved approximately 125 Harvard University students who were investigated for cheating on the take-home final examination of the spring 2012 edition of Government 1310: ""Introduction to Congress"". Harvard announced the investigation publicly on August 30, 2012. Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris described the case as ""unprecedented in its scope and magnitude"". The Harvard Crimson ranked the scandal as the news story most important to Harvard in 2012.A teaching fellow noticed similarities between a small number of exams during grading in May 2012.
