Hilarious fucking timeline we live in =","blackmen",23,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmen/comments/14mjqii/affirmative_action/"

I guess after affirmative actions dismantling, he's emboldened enough to go specifically after Black women. But what I see is if this works, he'd have the precedent to go after organizations that specifically help Black men as well.","blackmen",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmen/comments/15qve66/edward_blum_is_back_at_it_again_but_specifically/"

Thought this would be a good video for this sub onto in light of the conversations from a few weeks ago following the affirmative action decision. Doesnt kumbaya things, doesnt neglect whats going right, but does makes a lot of great points about the pros and cons of solidarity between us in its current form.","blackmen",13,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmen/comments/15qdudt/rush_hour_blackasian_american_relations/"

My thought is that is a great opportunity for them to attract more black students however I do think in general that have to become more customer service oriented which means better facilities and overcoming some of the negative stigmas many have had over the years regarding financial aid and housing","blackmen",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackmen/comments/15j0nie/hbcus/"
