"2020-11-10",1605029763,"POTUS litigation tracking","President Trump, the GOP, and their allies filed over 60 cases. They lost every last one of them in abysmal fashion. It's 1/8/21. This thread is coming down! But we're going to have another impeachment thread because the President tried to have a mob destroy Congress.



Let's keep a thread running of all the active and dismissed cases, the relief sought, whether it would flip the election, and maybe a brief summary of the merits or lack thereof.

What you put in the comments I'll include in the top post here.

**New Mexico**

Trump v. Secretary of State -- Active Case -- This case was filed as the Electoral College is voting and it seeks to enjoin New Mexico's electors from certifying the election/voting in the EC. It doesn't make any novel argument that hasn't been shot down by other courts. Also filing a lawsuit like this on the day the EC votes is not timely, to say the least. They also want the court to remand the case to a place it's never been: the state legislature. The state legislature is controlled by democrats. 

I'm including it up here because it's an actual Trump case and not one of his allies. Also they might get sanctioned for this. There's no purpose in filing this lawsuit except to be vexatious to a state that didn't vote for Trump and to use the court as a fundraising tool.

**Texas**

Texas v. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin -- Cert. Denied -- [Texas filed for a Preliminary Injunction to flip the election.](https://www.scribd.com/document/487348461/TX-v-State-Mpi-2020-12-07-Final#from_embed). [Trump Intervened](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163234/20201209155327055_No.%2022O155%20Original%20Motion%20to%20Intervene.pdf) Texas argues they have standing because the Vice President would be Kamala Harris, and the Constitution requires equal suffrage in the Senate. (This reads like a joke, but it's not. Texas believes that their preferred candidate not winning an election is an injury to the state. Their standing argument is that they don't like elections, basically.) Texas claims deadlines are unconstitutional. They also make a Frankenstein's monster of an argument that cobbles together claims already shot down in the other 50+ lawsuits Trump and his allies have lost in the courts challenging election protocols. [I wrote some stuff about it here in Legalish](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/legalish-election-litigation-update-rudys-big-day-out-brian-lynch/?trackingId=hqcWi%2BJFRKWkD32dwp1Mtw%3D%3D. 

Some spicy flavor notes to this glass of awful: the solicitor general of Texas is conspicuously absent. He's the designated SCOTUS attorney for the state. The person running it is Attorney General Paxton, a guy that's facing a criminal indictment from a grand jury and faced recent allegations of bribery. 

Edit: its dead. Dismissed on standing. Alito and Thomas dissented. Would have heard the case but denied relief.

**Pennsylvania** 

*[Donald J Trump v. Boockvar](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/2020-11-09-complaint-as-filed.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2220IfyKv6yE_3tG60ZtpPwYXU5oev6aar2vpBxA8ragcUw5tiaYJIi-E)* -- [dismissed with prejudice](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.202.0_1.pdf)  Trump campaign has asked the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to order the governor of Pennsylvania not to certify election results. The request stems from several complaints that vote-by-mail ballots were permitted to be corrected in some counties but not othersin other words, nothing that could possibly justify stopping the Secretary of State and Governor from certifying the results. 

This is the first serious attempt at litigation but the relief sought is a heavy ask which is to not allow PA to have an election this year.

[In Re: Canvassing Observation
Appeal of: City of Philadelphia Board of Elections](https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/DocketSheets/AppellateCourtReport.ashx?docketNumber=30+EAP+2020&amp;dnh=J0Ej52DFuhKD8zIZIJ5LMw%3d%3d) --[ Appellate court's decision is reversed. Trial court's order denying Trump campaign relief is reinstated; namely, the observation distance rules were fine.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20407623/pa-supreme-court-decision-on-election-observers.pdf)  --  [Thank you /u/OrangeInnards!]


In this case, the County of Philadelphia Board of Electors is appealing a decision about the distance observers can be to the ballot counters. An appellate court reversed a trial court saying protocols for the distance between observers and counters were fine. The County seems to want their initial protocols affirmed by the State Supreme Court even if the issue is moot. [Thank you /u/_Doctor_Teeth_ for contributing!]

[Update](https://www.dailywire.com/news/gop-win-in-pa-judge-tosses-thousands-of-ballots-without-dates-reversing-lower-court-ruling): ""2,349 absentee ballots in Allegheny County where the voter didnt date their declaration are invalid, reversing a lower court judge.""

*Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Boockvar, 20-542; Scarnati v. Pennsylvania Democratic Party, 20-574* -- Active case -- This is the case about the 4,900 or so ballots received by mail in Pennsylvania between 8 p.m. November 3 and November 6, but postmarked by Election Day. These 4,900 or so ballots are not enough to make up Trumps 45,000 vote deficit even if they all were counted his way. In any event, Republicans are asking for the opposite relief: they want these ballots not to count. Case is interesting pretty much exclusively because SCOTUS could touch it but it's doubtful they will because the outcome wouldn't affect anything.

**Georgia**

[Lin Wood  v. Raffensperger](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ta0rze1m3flzk5o/2020-11-13%20Complaint%20-%20L.%20Wood%20v.%20Raffensperger%20et%20al.pdf?dl=0) against GA SoS et. al in Northern district of GA (original filing 11/13.) -- Active case --  Edit: I previously had this listed as a dismissed case. The court dismissed a motion for TRO on lack of standing but didn't dismiss the entire lawsuit for lack of standing. Alleged is that the defendants unilaterally changed election procedures specifically with regard to absentee ballots (including curing,) improperly.  The suit asks to exclude the absentee ballots from the GA tabulation and certification, and to proscribe any certification which includes said absentee ballots.

[Brooks v. Mahoney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gasd.82897/gov.uscourts.gasd.82897.1.0.pdf) -- Active case -- Republican voters submitted a host of issues about ballots and voting issues. E.g., voters not receiving requested ballots and having to use a provisional instead or ballot counters counting ballots in secret after 10:30 pm at State Farm Arena. Relief requested is to invalidate the election results in Atlanta and some of the state's most populous suburbs. 

 In Re: Enforcement of Election Laws and Securing Ballots Cast or Received after 7:00pm on November 3, 2020, SPCV20-00982 -- Dismissed -- A Republican poll watcher went to the bathroom. When he got back 53 ballots had been processed while he was taking his evening constitutional. At an evidentiary hearing the case fell tp pieces. The relief sought wouldn't have changed the outcome anyway. Case dismissed.

**Arizona**

[Donald J Trump v. Hobbs](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/verified-complaint-with-attachments.pdf) -- Dismissed -- Plaintiffs realized relief requested would not flip the outcome of the election and voluntarily dismissed -- This is a case about overvoting in Maricopa County. This is basically Sharpiegate but repackaged and even includes declarations from people complaining about Sharpies. Trump's attorneys allege that poll workers either pushed or induced voters to push a green button to override warnings about overvoting. The relief sought mirrors the process for overvotes in the AZ Elections Manual (which has the weight of law in AZ). The relief sought will not change the outcome.

**Michigan**


[Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. v. Benson](https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/09915961445.pdf) \-- Dismissed by Plaintiffs -- Complaint filed Nov. 11.  Description from Democracy Docket:  ""*Trump lawsuit claiming fraud in Wayne County election. The suit seeks to halt the certification of election results in Wayne County and statewide*."" [Thank you /u/satanmanning !]

This case was voluntarily dismissed by the Trump campaign. They asserted that officials refused to certify the election for Biden and put this statement in their dismissal.

[Costantino v Detroit](https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf) [Credit /u/spartangrrl78! Thank you for contributing!] -- Dismissed -- plaintiffs interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible --



https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Motion-for-TRO-Brief-Order-Costantino.pdf

Of note: The law firm that is handling this is the same who represented the barber out of mid-Michigan who didn't want to follow Whitmer's stay at home order last spring and stayed open and as a result, the guy became a cult hero. 

Anyway, 3 out of the 5 affiants are political activists for the GOP. That isn't to say that means that's unusual, given that they were GOP poll watchers/advisers, But it makes you question why they all volunteered at the Detroit precinct when none of them live in Detroit. 

Patrick Colbeck ran for the gubernatorial GOP nomination in 2018 and had single-digit support, made a bunch of racist and xenophobic attacks against Abdul el Sayed and is generally not someone that I would think acts in good faith.

One of them is an attorney who seems to be a conservative activist.

Another is a former chair of a local GOP.

Another has in his LinkedIn profile that he is literally a 'political activist.'

I'm not saying that makes these guys less credible, I'm just saying that it seems like all of them signed up to work at the polls with an agenda. Its even obvious from their affidavits that they were just getting in the way and being obnoxious, or misunderstood the entire process and are trying to frame it in an underhanded way. (AKA Colbeck climbing under desks to see if a modem was connected for literally no reason, the other guy insinuating that there was something underhanded about a box of ballots arriving in a mail bin).

[Donald Trump v Secretary of State](https://www.wilx.com/2020/11/09/trump-campaign-files-appeal-on-vote-counting-ruling/) -- Appealed -- Case was dismissed at the trial court because the relief sought was moot. Trump's attorneys want access to video surveillance of voting drop off spots through the appeal anyway. They failed to file about 8 different documents though so they need to cure defects in filing before proceeding.

**Nevada**

[*Stokke cases*](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/republican-claims-of-voting-irregularities-in-nevada-flopped-before-a-federal-judge/) -- Dismissed -- An elderly woman sent in a ballot that was verified and received. She had an issue with that. Was offered the ability to sign an affidavit confirming her vote. Case dismissed in state court. Claims were repackaged for federal court in a 6-page filing with no additional evidence really. Case dismissed.

[Trump Electors v. Biden Electors](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/nov-17-doc-2.pdf) -- Active case -- Trump electors demand that Trump be announced the winner or that no one be certified the winner. The complaint seems to focus on GOTV efforts by democrats being unfair somehow but doesn't specify why. They make some noise about voting machines not functioning properly but concede they don't have evidence this would affect the outcome (""evidence will show..."" but they don't have anything in the complaint) and then construe this to be an equal protection issue because machine verification of signatures is different than visually checking them. (Note: it's kind of facially ridiculous to think that a computer would have a more difficult time than a human verifying signatures. ) Regardless of the merits the ask is gigantic here.

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the Universitys investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's],"" wrote Justice Souter, ""[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. 

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent. 

-----

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the fathers name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the fathers registration. The mother listed Baby Girls ethnicity as Hispanic instead of Native American on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an Indian Child under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couples petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a parent under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the fathers consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define parent to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. 

* CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. 

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,""Indian, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6.""

**UTSW v. Nassar** 

* *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassars productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassars presence, Middle Easterners are lazy. In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keisers presence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassars productivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar applied for a promotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levines harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a position at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding positions to be filled by faculty doctors. In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back pay and compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to support the claim of constructive discharge.

* *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive, or does the provision require only proof that the employer had mixed motives for taking an action? 

[Oral Argument.](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_484)

Due to length constraints I will recommend checking out this [post](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2013/06/sole-motives-and-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar.html) on the subject. Eyer believes this might be one of the most important civil rights cases this year along Shelby. What does the role of mixed motives play in employee discrimination? No act has a single motivator and the Court is divided.

Diamond v.  Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature, id., at 310. Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA.

(1) Whether Congresss approval of an interstate water compact that grants the contracting states equal rights to certain surface water and  using language present in almost all such compacts provides that the compact shall not be deemed . . . to interfere with each states appropriation, use, and control of water . . . not inconsistent with its obligations under this Compact, manifests unmistakably clear congressional consent to state laws that expressly burden interstate commerce in water; and (2) whether a provision of a congressionally approved multi-state compact that is designed to ensure an equal share of water among the contracting states preempts protectionist state laws that obstruct other states from accessing the water to which they are entitled by the compact.

*The Court rules that the compact does not preempt the state water laws of Oklahoma. This involves an interpretation of the Red River Compact.*

Details: **Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.**

As part of an effort to increase voter registration and turnout, in 1993 Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act.  The Act requires states to accept and use a specific federal form for voter registration; that form asks, among other things, whether the would-be voter is a citizen of the United States and over the age of eighteen.  In 2004, Arizona voters approved a law that requires election officials in that state to refuse to register any would-be voter who cannot prove that he is in fact a citizen.  Arizona residents, along with voting and civil rights groups, challenged the state law, arguing that it could not stand because it conflicted with, and was trumped by, the NVRA.  The challengers won in the lower court, and the Supreme Court granted review last fall to consider not only whether the state law can survive, but also whether the lower court used the right test in making its decision:  that court held that because the Constitution allows Congress to make or change election rules established by the states, Congress can veto any state laws relating to elections, even if it doesnt make clear that it intends to do so.

Today the Court held, in a seven-to-two decision by Justice Scalia, that Arizonas law cannot stand in the face of the NVRA. The Court first recognized that under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to dictate when, where, and how elections are held, and state election laws that conflict with federal ones are therefore preempted and without effect. The Court thus held that by requiring states to accept and use the federal form, the NVRA effectively required the states to treat the federal form as sufficient evidence of citizenship without any additional proof, so that Arizonas proof-of-citizenship requirement was contrary to the NVRA, and therefore invalid.  The Court recognized that the words accept and use do not necessarily carry such a broad meaning  they could mean only that the state was required to consider the federal form  but based on the context and the other provisions in the NVRA, the Court concluded that the requirement to accept and use the federal form has the stronger effect of requiring states to treat the federal form as sufficient. On the question of which legal test to apply, the Court made it clear that while preemption under the Supremacy Clause (which provides that federal law generally trumps contrary state law) requires Congress to clearly state its intent to preempt state requirements, preemption under the Elections Clause is more easily found because federal elections law will alwaysdisplace state law.

Finally, the Court held that in the future, Arizona can ask the federal Election Assistance Commission, which creates the federal form, to include a requirement of additional proof of citizenship in the form, and to bring different legal challenges if the EAC refuses to do so.

Justice Kennedy drafted a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment; Justices Thomas and Alito each filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that Arizonas requirement should not have been held preempted.

**Salinas v. Texas.**  

Texas CCA affirmed.  Issue: Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendments Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendants refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.  Alito opinion says the defendant did not expressly invoke his 5th Amendment rights so the prosecutor can comment on this silence to police questioning.

Details: **FTC v. Actavis**
This case is an antitrust challenge to an increasingly common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name companies faced with generic competition pay the would-be competitor an amount of money to stay out of the market.  The payment comes in the form of settling a dispute over the validity or infringement of the brand-name companys patent.  Because generic entry reduces drug prices, these pay for delay or reverse payment agreements are alleged to reduce competition and increase drug costs.  The Federal Trade Commission sued drug companies over one such deal.  The court of appeals rejected that claim, explaining that the brand names patent includes the right to exclude competitors.

Today, by a vote of five to three, the Supreme Court reversed and held that the claim can go forward.  Justice Breyer wrote the Courts opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas.  Justice Alito was recused from the case.

The Court held that the government and private parties may seek to prove that these payments violate the antitrust laws.  It refused, however, to hold them presumptively illegal.  The ruling is likely to essentially put an end to such payments in the future.  Litigation over previous deals will continue in the lower courts.

Details: **Maracich v. Spears**
A federal law, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), prohibits the use of a drivers information from a state DMV without prior permission from the driver.  In this case, lawyers sued South Carolina car dealers on behalf of four individuals who had recently bought cars, alleging that the car dealers had violated a state consumer protection law.  Using contact information from the South Carolina DMV, they then tried to find additional plaintiffs for their lawsuits so that they could form a class action lawsuit.  However, lawyers for the car dealers then filed a lawsuit on behalf of other South Carolinians who had recently bought cars, alleging that the use of the information from the DMV violated the DPPA.  At issue before the Court was whether the original lawsuit against the car dealers was allowed under a provision of the DPPA that creates a litigation exception to the laws general ban on use of driver data; that exception allows the use of driver data in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any Federal, State, or local court . . . including . . . investigation in anticipation of litigation.

Writing for a five-Justice majority, Justice Kennedys opinion for the Court held that the litigation exception does not apply to attorney solicitations of potential clients using DMV data.   Because the statute generally protects highly sensitive information, any exception should be read narrowly, the Court held.  The reference to an investigation in anticipation extends only to activities to decide whether a potential claim has sufficient merit to warrant a lawsuit, or to locate witnesses, but not activities designed to sign up clients for a case.

The Court remanded the case for the lower courts to decide whether, viewed objectively, the predominant purpose of the use of the DMV information was for client solicitation (in which case it was illegal) or for some other permissible litigation-related purposes (in which case it was legal).

Joining Justice Kennedys opinion were the Chief Justice, along with Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito.  Justices Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

**ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES.**  

Issue: Whether this Courts decision in Harris v. United States, holding that the Constitution does not require facts which increase a mandatory minimum sentence to be determined by a jury, should be overruled.  

Held: Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element that must be submitted to the jury.  Thomas went with majority.  He is into juries deciding things at least.

**Opinions-**

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

9th Circuit reversed.

Justice Alito dissents.

**2) AmEx v. Italian Colors (Scalia writes, 5-3)**

Issue: Whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts, invoking the federal substantive law of arbitrability, to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a federal-law claim. 

Decision summary: *The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiffs cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery. ""In Plain English, this means that if you have a contract with a business in which you agree to arbitrate a dispute but it says you can't get together with other plaintiffs in a ""class action,"" that contract will be enforced, even if it may be too expensive for you to pursue your own claim given what you might win.""*

2nd Circuit reversed. 

Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan dissent.

**3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes, 6-2)**

Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C. § 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.

Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program. The Policy Requirement violates the First Amendment by compelling as a condition of federal funding the affirmation of a belief that by its nature cannot be confined within the scope of the Government program.*

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-10_21p3.pdf)

2nd Circuit affirmed. 

Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

Kagan recused.

**Informed Speculation**:

- We can now confidently speculate that Shelby County v. Holder will be written by Roberts. This is due to Scalia writing the AmEx decision today. This favors the plaintiffs in Shelby County. 

- We can now confidently speculate that Koontz v. St. Johns River will be written by Alito. This is due to Kagan writing the Descamps decision today. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Alito will write the opinion in Vance v. Ball State. This favors the respondent Ball State. 

- We can confidently speculate that Kennedy will write the opinion in Fisher v. UT-Austin. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

- We can confidently speculate that Roberts and Kennedy will be writing Perry/Windsor. No consensus on what this means for the decision. 

*Speculation is based upon the monthly distribution of opinions.*

Isnt that a contradiction in the separation of powers?","From what i read it sounds like the most recent circuit court argued POTUS has the authority to rescind an executive order, but had not provided sufficiently legal basis for it (please correct me if im mischaracterising).

Since its an executive order/policy, why does POTUS need to justify discontinuing it, and to whom? Wouldnt that be a blurring of the separation of powers?

It seems a little more tricky considering that this is, as I understand it, electively enforcing a change in operational policy, and selectively deffering to act in a certain way for certain cases, which, to my knowledge, DACA itself was (the legal status of dreamers was never changed, right? Just how the office prioritized their cases)? 


To my the knowledgle point of executive actions is to allow swift action to prevent stagnation while the legislature works on the longer term position/policy, wouldn't requiring justification for discontinuing an executive policy create an undue hurdle?

Wouldnt this set precedent for the courts or legislature to micromanage the executive branches reportees? 


Even if we accept that the potus needs to justify not acting in a certain way (which is itself dubious, justify actions sure, but not acting?? Opens up pabdoras box, no?), what is the litmus test? To my knowledge the argument put forward was that the practice is illegal to begin with since there was no initial authority to enact DACA within constitutional bounds, so the legal basis would be preventing the continuation of an illegal act? When there is potentially a illegal act occurring, is it not better to halt said act and determine legality, particularly when inaction itself is not illegal? 

If the executive branch opts not to pardon someone, or a judge sets aside a conviction, the courts cant compel the executive branch to pardon an individual, or affirm a conviction, while determining whether there is legal sufficiency for not pardoning the individual or setting aside the conviction. Or is that incorrect (courts being an imperfect example since its within the same branch of governemnt; a better example might be forcing a attorneys office to trial, even tho they believe there is insufficient legal stsnding to proceed and win,  in usurpation of prosecutorial discretion)?

So even if we accpet overview from the other branches on executive policy, which im not inclined towards, wouldn't the default be nonaction to begin with? Wouldnt compelling action be akin to the other branches usurping executive authority/overstepping vested powers?

There is a difference in saying the executive can't do something and that the executive branch must do something - which isn't technically law; no?

You may be able to tell that i happen to have a certain view on the legality of this but these are honest questions, am i missing something in my logic/fundamentals? Im not a lawyer and so eager to learn!

2. The 2nd amendment seems to be at odds with most gun control laws.
3. The first amendment seems to be at odds with the existence of ""Free Speech Zones.""

My guess is that there are specific legal justifications for those apparent differences, and that it's just my ignorant and superficial reading of those that make them look contradictory.

My question is this: Is there any concern in the legal/judicial community that regular people will see what I see, and conclude that the rules are being bent or broken?  Or that the law really is inconsistent?  Or, is the focus just on getting the law right and damn what the public thinks?

Please do correct me if I'm wrong.  But effectively this is what I've gathered from it...

&gt;In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13-356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company-Conestoga Wood Specialties-a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third [*2] Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not ""engage in religious exercise"" under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity. In No. 13-354, the Greens, their children, and their companies-Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel-were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that the Greens' businesses are ""persons"" under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the ""least restrictive means"" of furthering a compelling governmental interest.

This to me says... the Third Circuit ruled that they can not practice religion and therefore can not claim the exemption from the RFRA.  Then the Tenth Circuit ""reversed"" (which I understand to mean undid that ruling?  effectively making it so they *can* get out of paying for birth control).  Then we read the conclusion...

&gt;For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

What does this mean?  I read it as ""let's undo the Tenth's undoing and make it illegal for them to be exempt from it"".  I feel like I'm very obviously misunderstanding this.  Can anyone shed some light on this topic?

"2012-04-19",1334812761,"Does Equal Protection (Con. Law) apply to a union of classes or only an intersection?","   Im writing to get a discussion going about the best way to apply equal protection analysis to a law that classifies based on two classes.
     Here is a hypo to explain: A law precludes 21 to 24 year old males from being served more than two beers at a bar. Under equal protection analysis, there are two classes Age and Sex.

I. Under the analysis I was taught, we go through each class separately. The age class supports a rational basis analysis. The government says that the goal is to reduce drunk driving or more generally promote traffic safety. At least 25% of drunk driving accidents occur from people between the ages of 21-24, but only 3% of this age group gets into accidents. The goal rationally related to the means, so the law is fine as far as age goes. The sex classification is intermediate scrutiny. The goal is the same, and traffic safety is an important purpose. Under a means analysis, the law is overinclusive because not all men drive after they have had two beers; perhaps only 20% do. Additionally the law is over inclusive because some women drink and drive (5%). Thus, the means isnt substantially connected to the goal, and the law gets booted as being unconstitutional for violating equal protection. Disclaimer  statistics are mostly made up.

II. Under at least one case (Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976)), the Court looks at the statistics for the intersection of the classes and applies the highest level of scrutiny accorded the intersection. So&
 Under intermediate scrutiny the goal is the same (traffic safety), and it is important. The means is based on the statistic that compelled the law: about 92% of drunk driving accidents between people of ages 21-24 are caused by males, but only 2% of males between the ages of 21-24 get in such accidents. Only .18% of females of that age group get into such accidents. The goal is thus not substantially connected to the means, and the law gets chucked.

  Although, in this case both analyses get the law thrown out, I think the analyses (I. and II.) would play out differently under different suspect classes. For two non-suspect classes it would give you different answers. For instance,  a law that prevents age 21-24, gay people from serving alcohol because they are more likely to serve minors (with similar statistics as above). Under the first analysis (separating the classes) the law would hold up, but probably not under the second analysis (looking at the combined). 

 Juxtapose to another hypo -- affirmative action for two suspect classes: black, female engineers get a stipend for higher education to promote diversity in school. Grutter (539 U.S. 306) provides some precedent. In that case, a similar practice was upheld because race was not the only factor in admitting students to law school. The factors could be weighted to conform to Grutter: only females with a certain GPA are eligible for the scholarship, and if there is a tie the state school can consider ethnicity as tie breaker.  Under Analysis I the state practice would probably be ok (female engineers are an important goal to promote a balanced workforce, and race is ok to consider as one factor in the compelling interest of diversity under Grutter), but under analysis II the practice would probably be considered unconstitutional (race, sex, and GPA cannot be the sole criteria for the scholarship similar to Gratz, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).

And what does mental reservation or purpose of evasion mean?

I ask this because I'm trying to draw comparisons between William Black's  notion of ""Control Fraud"" and the behavior of some of those in office that  clearly aren't working on behalf of the public like the social contract would imply they should (and didn't Locke's social contract inspire a good deal of our legal system?) If you've ever thought of this before, I'd *love* to hear your thoughts. In what way is it similar? In what way is it different? Most importantly I'm just looking at how we can conceptualize the actions of those politicians who act in opposition to the interests of the American public as a violation of the social contract - and thus, a control fraud. I have other ideas on this typed up, but I need some time to organize them and such before posting, sorry if I seem noncontributory.
