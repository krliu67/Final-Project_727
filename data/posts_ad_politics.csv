In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the high courts six-justice conservative majority found that the universities discriminated against white and Asian American applicants by using race-conscious policies that benefited applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, saying the Harvard and UNC admissions programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today. he wrote.

The three liberal justices dissented; with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the ruling closes the door of opportunity that the Courts precedents helped open to young students of every race.

The decision is expected to upend universities decadeslong efforts to create racially diverse campuses. Lets discuss what this means and [what comes next](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/school-admissions-after-scotus-affirmative-action-00104293)  ask us anything.

I'm 63 and I'm Tired
by Robert A. Hall    


I'm 63.  Except for one semester in college when jobs were scarce and a six-month period when I was between jobs, but job-hunting every day, I've worked, hard, since I was 18. Despite some health challenges, I still put in 50-hour weeks, and haven't called in sick in seven or eight years. I make a good salary, but I didn't inherit my job or my income, and I worked to get where I am. Given the economy, there's no retirement in sight, and I'm tired. Very tired.  

I'm tired of being told that I have to ""spread the wealth"" to people who don't have my work ethic. I'm tired of being told the government will take the money I earned, by force if necessary, and give it to people too lazy to earn it.  

I'm tired of being told that I have to pay more taxes to ""keep people in their homes.""  Sure, if they lost their jobs or got sick, I'm willing to help. But if they bought McMansions at three times the price of our paid-off, $250,000 condo, on one-third of my salary, then let the left-wing Congress-critters who passed Fannie and Freddie and the Community Reinvestment Act that created the bubble help them with their own money.  

I'm tired of being told how bad  America  is by left-wing millionaires like Michael Moore, George Soros and Hollywood Entertainers who live in luxury because of the opportunities  America  offers. In thirty years, if they get their way, the United States  will have the economy of  Zimbabwe , the freedom of the press of  China , the crime and violence of Mexico , the tolerance for Christian people of   Iran , and the freedom of speech of Venezuela .

I'm tired of being told that Islam is a ""Religion of Peace,"" when every day I can read dozens of stories of Muslim men killing their sisters, wives and daughters for their family ""honor""; of Muslims rioting over some slight offense; of Muslims murdering Christian and Jews because they aren't ""believers""; of Muslims burning schools for girls; of Muslims stoning teenage rape victims to death for ""adultery""; of Muslims mutilating the genitals of little girls; all in the name of Allah, because the Qur'an and Shari'a law tells them to.  

I'm tired of being told that ""race doesn't matter"" in the post-racial world of Obama, when it's all that matters in affirmative action jobs, lower college admission and graduation standards for minorities (harming them the most), government contract set-asides, tolerance for the ghetto culture of violence and fatherless children that hurts minorities more than anyone, and in the appointment of U.S. Senators from Illinois.  

I think it's very cool that we have a black president and that a black child is doing her homework at the desk where Lincoln  wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. I just wish the black president was Condi Rice, or someone who believes more in freedom and the individual and less arrogantly of an all-knowing government.  

I'm tired of a news media that thinks Bush's fundraising and inaugural expenses were obscene, but that think Obama's, at triple the cost, were wonderful; that thinks Bush exercising daily was a waste of presidential time, but Obama exercising is a great example for the public to control weight and stress; that picked over every line of Bush's military records, but never demanded that Kerry release his; that slammed Palin, with two years as governor, for being too inexperienced for VP, but touted Obama with three years as senator as potentially the best president ever. Wonder why people are dropping their subscriptions or switching to Fox News?  Get a clue. I didn't vote for Bush in 2000, but the media and Kerry drove me to his camp in 2004.  

I'm tired of being told that out of ""tolerance for other cultures"" we must let  Saudi Arabia  use our oil money to fund mosques and madrassa Islamic schools to preach hate in  America , while no American group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in  Saudi Arabia  to teach love and tolerance.  

I'm tired of being told I must lower my living standard to fight global warming, which no one is allowed to debate. My wife and I live in a two-bedroom apartment and carpool together five miles to our jobs. We also own a  three-bedroom condo where our daughter and granddaughter live. Our carbon footprint is about 5% of Al Gore's, and if you're greener than Gore, you're green enough.  

I'm tired of being told that drug addicts have a disease, and I must help support and treat them, and pay for the damage they do. Did a giant germ rush out of a dark alley, grab them, and stuff white powder up their noses while they tried to fight it off? I don't think Gay people choose to be Gay, but I damn sure think druggies chose to take drugs. And I'm tired of harassment from cool people treating me like a freak when I tell them I never tried marijuana.  

I'm tired of illegal aliens being called ""undocumented workers,"" especially the ones who aren't working, but are living on welfare or crime. What's next?  Calling drug dealers, ""Undocumented Pharmacists""?  And, no,  I'm not against Hispanics. Most of them are Catholic, and it's been a few hundred years since Catholics wanted to kill me for my religion.  I'm willing to fast track for citizenship any Hispanic person, who can speak English, doesn't have a criminal record and who is self-supporting without family on welfare, or who serves honorably for three years in our military.... Those are the citizens we need.  

I'm tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people than themselves. Do bad things happen in war?  You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave?  Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years and still are?  Not even close.  So here's the deal. I'll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims, who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we'll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear.  

I'm tired of people telling me that their party has a corner on virtue and the other party has a corner on corruption. Read the papers; bums are bipartisan. And I'm tired of people telling me we need bipartisanship. I live in  Illinois , where the ""Illinois Combine"" of Democrats has worked to loot the public for years. Not to mention the tax cheats in Obama's cabinet.  

I'm tired of hearing wealthy athletes, entertainers and politicians of both parties talking about innocent mistakes, stupid mistakes or youthful mistakes, when we all know they think their only mistake was getting caught. I'm tired of people with a sense of entitlement, rich or poor.  

Speaking of poor, I'm tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. The majority of Americans didn't have that in 1970, but we didn't know we were ""poor."" The poverty pimps have to keep changing the definition of poor to keep the dollars flowing.  

I'm real tired of people who don't take responsibility for their lives and actions. I'm tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination or big-whatever for their problems.  

Yes, I'm damn tired. But I'm also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I'm not going to have to see the world these people are making. I'm just sorry for my granddaughter.  

Robert  A. Hall is a Marine  Vietnam  veteran who served five terms in the  Massachusetts   State  Senate.

I'm not against conservative views or people who hold them. I am however against old people constantly hammering me with their ""the Mexicans are stealing our jobs"" rhetoric when I really didn't ask for it.

Speaking of poor, I'm tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. The majority of Americans didn't have that in 1970, but we didn't know we were ""poor."" The poverty pimps have to keep changing the definition of poor to keep the dollars flowing.  
 
I'm real tired of people who don't take responsibility for their lives and actions. I'm tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination or big-whatever for their problems.  
 
Yes, I'm damn tired. But I'm also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I'm not going to have to see the world these people are making. I'm just sorry for my granddaughter.

"Google and Other Personal Stalkers ","2012-01-25",1327513560,"Google and Other Personal Stalkers ","One day, in our very near future you will be denied a job or maybe a car loan, or admission to a school because you visited the wrong web site while using Google or Amazon or the other million companies who will monetize your personal information. One day very soon, you will be categorized, labeled and identified not by who you are but by the way you view the internet.

We as a country have allowed our fascination with emerging technology numb our brains in to thinking we are safe but in fact we are all lambs being led to slaughter. We don't have to go very far back in history to remind ourselves (again) that human beings are willing to murder millions of people just because they do not believe or think like those in charge. Make no mistake, Google, Amazon and the other personal stalkers are setting the stage to classify, categorize and label every American so that one day soon, we will be discriminated against, denied opportunities and even some murdered because of the web sites they have visited.

It's time to end personal stalking and data gathering on the internet.
The vast majority of us are against SOPA and Pipa meanwhile the most dangerous intrusion in to our personal liberties is being sold and resold on a daily basis and it goes completely unnoticed. These managers from Google, Amazon etc.. make Exxon &amp; Wall Street Bankers look like angels from heaven. 

Let's boycott all internet companies that track personal information and show them we will not stand to have our personal freedoms stolen and sold to the highest bidder.","politics",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/owaeu/google_and_other_personal_stalkers/"

"How Do You Feel About Bans on Private Discrimination Now?","2012-02-23",1329969378,"How Do You Feel About Bans on Private Discrimination Now?","The New York Times reports that ""a Supreme Court decision forbidding the use of race in admission at public universities would almost certainly mean that it would be barred at most private ones as well under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids racial discrimination in programs that receive federal money."" Here is another reason that progressives should not be so quick to dismiss the libertarian distinction between public and private discrimination. Two years ago Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who was then running for the Senate seat he now occupies, was pilloried for questioning the federal ban on private racial discrimination in places of ""public accommodation,"" on the assumption that anyone making such an argument must be either a naive ideologue or a closet racist. 

But the same property rights, freedom of association, and freedom of contract that allow bigoted businessmen to shun blacks make it possible for unpopular minorities to make a living, get ahead, and establish their own spheres of autonomy. These rights also would allow private institutions to pursue whatever race-conscious remedies they deemed appropriate in response to the lingering effects of slavery and institutionalized racism, no matter what the Supreme Court said.
