"2019-04-23",1556041025,"Does this sub really have a disdain for Affirmative Action?","After looking up some information about Affirmative Action, I also saw a reddit thread on this sub with many people saying AA shouldn't have been implemented to begin with. After searching ""Affirmative Action Reddit"", I came across even more posts and comments like this from this sub. I want to present an argument, and then a question based on the premise of the argument. I myself am Asian American, so I had to fill in the box when applying for schools too you know. Anyways.

Let's start with median incomes in the US

Asians - 80K  
White - 61K  
US median - 57K  
Pacific Islander - 57K  
Hispanic/Latino - 46K  
Other races - 44K  
Native American - 39K  
Black - 38K

So basically, Affirmative Action serves to be one of many, MANY initiatives aiming to get any race under the US median TO the US median. In theory, if all humans are capable of the same achievements in our civilization then discrepancies shouldn't be this great. But it's very obvious how the median incomes drop hard between Pacific Islanders and Hispanic/Latinos, and once again down to Native Americans and Blacks considered against the ""others"" option.

It may be worth it to also present these groups by per capita income as well

Asians - 34K  
White - 32K  
Pacific Islander - 21K  
Black - 20K  
Native American - 18K  
Hispanic/Latino - 16K

Amazingly, the drop off happens after White and that's it. Black Americans aren't actually at the bottom per-capita, which probably implies that there are more people poorer than the median than richer. Just to be clear, since the per-capita incomes are all less than the medians here, ALL of America's per-capita incomes have a bell curve that skews left. [An example just to be absolutely sure we're on the same page](http://jse.amstat.org/v13n2/vonhippel_figure1.gif). It's just that some skew harder or have less of a tail, implied by the re-ordering.

Back to affirmative action. Basically, Affirmative Action is a policy implemented by certain public systems, and even the private sector, to determine who is suitable for acceptance into a school, workplace, etc. when competition is present. It leads to outcomes where if two people of similar merit went for a job, but one was from a race which has a higher per-capita income, then they might be not be favoured. This is seen as controversial by many, because it can be seen as racist.

I believe that, despite being Asian American, I don't really mind Affirmative Action as a concept. I DO believe it needs reform, especially since poor whites are left behind by these programs, but it is sound in-theory simply because the different in income stats is so great that there's CLEARLY a problem that needs fixing here just due to America's history. If initiatives aren't taken to alleviate these problems in a meritocracy, then we could end up repeating the cycle that brought us to this point, as Americans.  


1. These income ratios between races would stay the same
2. After some time, the lesser income races would get profiled as uneducated, dangerous, etc. simply due to their lower average income (even when they're middle class).
3. Successful kids from lower income races succeed, and start to favour affirmative action due to these problems.
4. Affirmative Action is implemented
5. Affirmative Action is cut due to being against the idea of a perfect meritocracy
6. Repeat?  


Let me put it this way. What would you, as a person, see as more impressive? A black kid born into a low-income neighborhood with parents that value education but absolutely toxic bullies in elementary and middle school, and they don't have the means to send their kid to a private school. This black kid has to stay away from every bad influence he meets, even if that means becoming a total outcast. Also, he starts working a job while in highschool while some of his friends flunk entirely. He gets a 3.8 average in highschool regardless. He's also shown himself to have a kind heart and a passion for helping those around him. Or. A white kid born into a family where the father does Real-Estate somewhat successfully and the mother works in IT in a small company. This white kid's parents also value education, and they're able to send him to a private school as such. He gets a 3.6 there. However, colleges weigh students from that private school as 0.4 GPA higher relative to the black kid's public school. So he would effectively be a 4.0 student in public school, in their eyes. That said, he didn't really get bullied, and most bad influences were only as bad as they needed to be without actually doing bad academically. The truly bad influences, the types of guys that will flunk out, he also avoids just like the black kid, but at a private school there aren't many of those (I went to a private school and there was only 1 guy like that, period). Overall, he's a good kid with a kind heart too. Volunteers and does service all the time. Honestly, it may be hard, but I UNDERSTAND the reason AA would pick the black kid. By giving this black kid more resources than he ever had in the past, you have the potential to make a successful black kid, then a successful black adult, and then a successful black adult who also uplifts his originally low-income neighborhood if he chooses to stay around that culture. I've seen it with my own eyes too. I go to a mosque here in Atlanta in a black neighborhood occasionally, and the adults that lead this mosque are very proper and are always making strides to give back to the community. They've pretty much changed the culture in their part of Atlanta alongside the three churches and the school in that area, through what I've gathered talking to them (they're old people). I can affirm this, because going a few blocks east or west of that neighborhood brings you to uneducated Atlanta, like Pittsburgh or Lakewood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the context of AA for Asian Americans is that Asians have higher incomes and education, and it's HEAVILY due to the amount of vetting and barriers to immigration (AKA brain-drain from our ancestor countries ugh). But beyond this, I don't really see this as a big deal. I still got into the college I wanted to, a very prestigious one at that (Emory). In fact, my background of being the son of two doctors that went to a private school probably has something to do with it, considering I got a 3.2 in highschool. In the grand scheme of American civilization, I'm willing to have a slightly higher bar for success than others if it means that America as a whole is benefiting tenfold. Now, AGAIN, there are so many flaws with actual implemented AA, that I think prevents me from supporting it as it is now. I believe that it needs to be reformed so that it targets low-income situations much more than situations by race. There was a case of a low-income Asian being discriminated in Harvard admissions over a middle-income black kid that led to controversy a while back. In subsequent years, [movements](http://time.com/5425147/harvard-affirmative-action-trial-asian-american-students/) have been made to combat this problem, and I do agree with it to a certain extent. We need to target concentrated poverty, more or less. But otherwise I do support the mission it is trying to achieve. *The racial implications of AA only exist because #2 above happens, people make stereotypes of races based on the average income of that race and how people of those incomes usually act or live. And this leads to prejudice. If people weren't prone to casual racism, I do believe there'd be less support for AA. But is that reality? It's up to you to decide.*

But recently I've been noticing that East Asians are explicitly excluded from this term, while south Asians and southeast Asians are now brown.

I guess this is what POC entails now, I just wish there was some more clarity to this. 

And I can't help but admit that it does make me feel like I shouldn't even be here. It seems that the only time East Asians are really ever mentioned in the cultural, social, and racial conversation in this country is when we are asked to step aside ( affirmative action, proximity to whiteness, etc.)

Written by Steven Pinker.  He's a notable scientist and a Harvard professor, and here's his take.  Although he references Ron Unz's famous piece on Asian-American discrimination, this isn't just about Asian-Americans.  Affirmative action is a crux issue within our community, so it's nice to have one of today's great minds give us their opinion on this.

I'm pretty outspoken about how horrible holistic admissions or affirmative action are, and how meritocratic admissions is both more ethical and superior in student body.  On ethical grounds alone, I'm against systemic racism.

&gt; * It's acceptable to be racist against Asians. Most people wouldn't bat an eyelash if you say, ""Everyone knows Asian guys have small penises."" But saying, ""Everyone knows black guys are stupid"" will cause all hell to break loose. BOTH ARE IGNORANT STATEMENTS. But to people who say the first: ""How many Asian penises have you actually seen?"" Exactly.

&gt; At least you can tell people you go to [top 20 school I go to] to prove you're not stupid; you can't exactly whip out your dick.

&gt; * Affirmative action. We are a minority with very little political power and we are held to a higher standard than white people. We are fucked in college admissions, med school admissions, and job searches. Oh, and look up the bamboo ceiling.

&gt; * The media shits on us. In movie, we are unable to save our own women and the white man has to always save us. Having a preference for white guys is fine, but I've known countless Asian girls who have sworn off Asian guys just because they're ASIAN guys. That isn't right.

One of the replies was:

&gt;  OP, I am literally BLOWN that you had the audacity to compare your struggles to that of Blacks in America. I am so sorry that you are 33% of this campus compared to the less than 10% of Blacks. It must be so hard for you to strive to make a 4.0, get perfect SAT scores and be highly involved when your race has the highest salaries in this country and can afford much more private schooling and test prep. I can't imagine what it would be like to be judged off of being in a culture where your parents preach to you about working hard for economic success versus black students who are first generation college students, and have parents that would rather encourage them to get jobs to help support the family instead of spending money they don't have on college. My sincerest apologies that you have to spend so much time focusing on school work when you reside in the best neighborhoods in this country, where black students have to worry about not falling into the common trend of young, single, motherhood, or drug money. It also must be really discouraging that all of your peers of your race are working just as hard to create peer competition that leads to more economic success whereas blacks have a culture of bullying other blacks who try to get ahead academically or literally just don't see academics as a viable option because they don't see anyone of their own race doing it. And as for representation in the media, gosh I can't even imagine. Because blacks and latinos don't have just as much misrepresentation in the media or anything. You know what's even worse, If I sat next to you in an interview for an IT job, the employer would automatically be more partial to you than me because of your race. MUST BE SO HARD TO BE EXPECTED TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CAPABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

Are you fucking kidding me? Do people really think that every single Asian person is privileged like that? That assuming every single Asian person is well-off isn't harmful in the least?

How come we don't see affirmative action in government where people of color can affect the biggest change? In 2010 5.6% of the American population identified as Asian.

* Shouldn't 5.6% of senate be Asian?  Currently there is only 1 out of 100. Mazie Hirono, our 1%.

For example, how can one of us write about being for affirmative action, [while casually mentioning that a study claims that white students receive a 140 SAT bump compared to Asians](https://nyunews.com/opinion/2021/04/07/asian-americans-affirmative-action/), and not questioning that specific bump, considering all the advantages that white people have in this country?

The article says that affirmative action is not a zero-sum game, but **it's also not a binary for-or-against issue**. Is there a single advocacy group that recognizes this? In other words, is there a single advocacy group about this issue specifically and not about affirmative action in general?","asianamerican",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/rjy8ut/are_there_any_advocacy_groups_that_are_against/"

&amp;#x200B;

According to the above article, Asian Americans are the least likely group in the US to be promoted to management. I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all. Also, he mentioned that Asian Americans born and raised in America do not face any institutional discrimination other than affirmative action because they understand American culture and are good with English.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you agree with these opinions? It's kind of interesting because Asian Americans born and raised in the States generally agree that there are some kinds of bamboo ceilings but 1st generation Asian Americans tend to argue that there is no racism in the States and the Asian Americans who face racism are either 1) lack the adequate manner 2) not fluent in English 3) very unlucky or 4) should blame their lack of adequate skills rather than racism.

I'd generally give friends/strangers the benefit of the doubt until they showed otherwise.

But after years of being on Reddit, I feel like I've become pretty damn jaded. I used to think liberals were on my side; fighting for the rights of minorities and underprivileged, but Reddit seems to reinforce the idea that ideas and beliefs/actions are two separate things. 

There's so much sexist and racist shit that goes on in various topics, and the most frustrating part of it is that people actively ignore and dimiss discussion with the phrase of ""SJW"". Any article/idea that brings up white privilege or racism from whites is immediately bombareded with people claiming how difficult it is to be white, how whites are hurt from affirmative action, how being white is also just as bad as being anything else. With all of the police murders that have happened in the past year and how Reddit has turned #blacklivesmatter into a joke, I can't help but think how racist of a place this is.

For the past year or so I've subscribed to both /r/blackfellas and /r/blackladies to get more insight into the experiences of other minorities and it's been really eye opening.

"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

"2022-02-22",1645572354,"50+ years of ""Asian American"" - Has this term hurt or helped more?","""Asian American"" was coined as a term in 1968 to unite for political power, and reject the term ""oriental"". AAPI was an expansion of the term in the 1980s for the purposes of the US census. At the same time, these terms have been a contributor to the marginalization of people who aren't visible within this umbrella. With 50 years of Asian American behind us, and as a reader of r/asianamerican, do you feel like these terms have helped or harmed more?

There's significant discourse today around the disaggregation of ""Asian Americans"" within the US - especially around data. I'm pretty sold on the value of data disaggregation, but I don't have a well formed opinion about the pros and cons of umbrella terms like ""Asian American"" or ""AAPI"" when used in reference to sociopolitical issues (duly noted that data disaggregation is pretty firmly tied to these though).

[https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/](https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/)[https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/](https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/#:~:text=Data%20disaggregation%20in%20the%20AAPI,that%20certain%20AAPI%20subgroups%20face)

On one hand, I think it's incredibly valuable to be able to unite around a convenient, shared identity (say around #stopasianhate), but when talking about issues like affirmative action, economic mobility, and generally who benefits from ""Asian American exceptionalism"", I find that when I and others use those umbrella terms, it's incredibly easy to fall into harmful generalizations (i.e. the model minority myth). I often wish that I didn't have this term Asian American to lean on, or otherwise add a million caveats, in order to describe a particular phenomenon. When I read Asian American/AAPI in news, or even just within this subreddit without those specifying qualifications, I'm immediately turned off. I find that a lot of writing can be incredibly alienating to individuals who don't fall under the predominantly visible East Asian Taft-Hartley knowledge worker type immigrant families.

[https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/](https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/)

On the other hand, it's already hard enough to feel a shared identity when so many people don't share the same culture + history to unite. Would losing out on these umbrella terms make things even worse? I imagine if every AAPI organization/fellowship/etc turned into 20 different organizations/fellowships/etc, that would have its own problems.

Honestly it feels like there's no easy way to win.

My conclusion is that it never will be easy. Terms like Asian American and AAPI come with a heavy responsibility. The reason that these terms have failed us, is that those who have reaped the benefits have not invested more into uplifting those who remain the most marginalized, and are different from popular perception. Acknowledging the diversity is not enough - we need to actively include all people that these terms intentionally or unintentionally have labeled.

What do you think? Have we gained more from having these umbrella terms or do we only end up alienating more people not captured by popular perception behind?

P.S.

"2016-11-14",1479101236,"We Will Not Be Used: Are Asian-Americans the Racial Bourgeoisie?","By Mari J. Matsuda

American lawyer, activist, and law professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii. Prior to her return to Hawaii, Matsuda was a professor at the UCLA School of Law and Georgetown University Law Center, specializing in the fields of torts, constitutional law, legal history, feminist theory, critical race theory, and civil rights law.

Based on an April 1990 address to the Asian Law Caucus, first published February 1993
 
An essay I came across from Matsudas Where Is Your Body? And Other Essays on Race, Gender, and the Law.


*The Asian Law Caucus is the original public interest law firm serving the Asian-American community. It was built up from scratch by young, radical lawyers who carried files in their car trunks and stayed up all night to type their own briefs. The Asian Law Caucus has changed the lives of many-poor and working people, immigrants, and troubled youth - the least advantaged in the Asian-American community. The Caucus has also made history, successfully bringing landmark cases that have changed the law and the legal system. The supporters of the Caucus include many who participated in the civil rights and antiwar movements and who have worked all their lives in coalition with other people of color. This history is what inspired the words below, delivered at a fund-raising banquet in April 1990.*

It is a special honor to address supporters of the Asian Law Caucus. Here, before this audience, I am willing to speak in the tradition of our women warriors, to go beyond the platitudes of fundraiser formalism, and to talk of something that's been bothering me and that I need your help on. I want to speak of my fear that Asian-Americans are in danger of becoming the racial bourgeoisie, and of my resolve to resist that path. 

Marx wrote of the economic bourgeoisie -- the small merchants, the middle class, the baby capitalists--who were deeply confused about their self-interest. The bourgeoisie, he said, often emulate the manners and the ideology of the big-time capitalists. They are the wannabes of capitalism. Struggling for riches, often failing, confused about the reasons why, the economic wannabes go to their graves thinking that the big hit is right around the corner.

Living in 19th century Europe, Marx thought mostly in terms of class. Living in 20th century America, in the land where racism found a home, I am thinking about race. Is there a racial equivalent of the economic bourgeoisie? I fear there may be, and I fear it may be us.

If white, historically, is the top of the racial hierarchy in America, and black, historically, is the bottom, will yellow assume the place of the racial middle? The role of the racial middle is a critical one. It can reinforce white supremacy if the middle deludes itself into thinking it can be just like white if it tries hard enough. Conversely, the middle can dismantle white supremacy if it refuses to be the middle, if it refuses to buy into racial hierarchy, if it refuses to abandon communities of Black and Brown people, choosing instead to form alliances with them.

The theme of the unconventional fundraiser talk you are listening to is, ""we will not be used."" It is a plea to Asian-Americans to think about the ways in which our communities are particularly susceptible to playing the worst version of the racial bourgeoisie role.

In thinking this, I remember my mother's stories of growing up on a sugar plantation on Kauai. She tells of the Portuguese luna or overseer. The luna rode on a big horse and ordered the Japanese and Filipino workers around. The luna in my mother's stories is a tragic-comic figure. He thinks he is better than the other workers, but he doesn't realize that the plantation owner considers the luna sub-human, just like the other workers. The stereotype of the dumb portagee persists in Hawaii today, a holdover from the days of the luna parading around the big house, cloaked in self-delusion and false pride.

The double tragedy for the plantation nisei who hated the luna is that the sansei in Hawaii are becoming the new luna. Nice Japanese girls from Manoa Valley are going through four years of college to get degrees in Travel Industry Management, in order to sit behind a small desk in a big hotel, to dole out marching orders to brown-skinned workers and to take orders from a white man with a bigger desk and a bigger paycheck who never has to complicate his life by dealing with the brown people who make the beds and serve the food.  He need only deal with the Nice Japanese Girl, ex-Cherry Blossom Queen, eager to please, who doesn't know she will never make it to the bigger desk.

The portagee luna now has the last laugh with this new unfunny portagee joke: when the portagee was the luna, he didn't have to pay college tuition to ride that horse.

I'd like to say to my sister behind the small desk, ""remember where you came from and take this pledge: we will not be used.""

There are one hundred ways to use the racial bourgeoisie. Here are some examples:

When Asian-Americans manage to do well, their success is used against others. Internally, it is used to erase the continuing poverty and social dislocation within Asian-American communities. The media is full of stories of Asian-American whiz kids. Their successes are used to erase our problems and to disavow any responsibility for them. The dominant culture doesn't know about drug abuse in our communities, about our high school dropouts, our AIDS victims.

Suggestions that some segments of the Asian-American community need special help are greeted with suspicion and disbelief. External to our communities, our successes are used to deny racism and to put down other groups. African-Americans and Latinos and poor whites are told, ""look at those Asians--anyone can make it in this country if they really try."" The cruelty of telling this to crack babies, to workers displaced by runaway shops, and to families waiting in line at homeless shelters, is not something I want associated with my genealogy. 

Yes, my ancestors made it in this country, but they made it against the odds. In my genealogy and probably in yours, are people who went to bed hungry, who lost land to the tax collector, who worked to exhaustion and ill-health, who faced pain and relocation with the bitter stoicism we call, in Japanese, ""gaman."" Many who came the hard road of our ancestors didn't make it. Their bones are still in the mountains by the tunnels they blasted for the railroad, still in the fields where they stooped over the short-handled hoe, still in the graveyards of Europe, where they fought for a democracy that didn't include them. Asian success was success with a dark, painful price. 

To use that success to discount the hardship facing poor and working people in this country today is a sacrilege to the memory of our ancestors. It is an insult to today's Asian-American immigrants, who work the double-triple shift, who know no leisure, who crowd two and three families to a home, who put children and old-folks alike to work at struggling family businesses or at home doing piece-work until midnight. Yes, we take pride in our success, but we should also remember the cost. The success that is our pride is not to be given over as a weapon to use against other struggling communities. I hope we will not be used to blame the poor for their poverty.

Nor should we be used to deny employment or educational opportunities to others.  A recent exchange of editorials and letters in the Asian-American press reveals confusion over affirmative action.  Racist anti-Asian quotas at the universities can give quotas a bad name in our community. At the same time, quotas have been the only way we've been able to walk through the door of persistently discriminatory institutions like the San Francisco fire department.  

We need affirmative action because there are still employers who see an Asian face and see a person unfit for a leadership position. In every field where we have attained a measure of success, we are underrepresented in the real power positions. And yet, we are in danger of being manipulated into opposing affirmative action by those who say affirmative action hurts Asian-Americans. 

What's really going on here? When university administrators have secret quotas to keep down Asian admissions, this is because Asians are seen as destroying the predominantly white character of the university. Under this mentality, we can't let in all those Asian over-achievers and maintain affirmative action for other minority groups. We can't do both because that will mean either that our universities lose their predominantly white character, or that we have to fund more and better universities. To either of those prospects, I say, ""why not?"" And I condemn the voices from our own community that are translating legitimate anger at ceilings on Asian admissions into unthinking opposition to affirmative action floors needed to fight racism.

In a period when rates of educational attainment for minorities and working class Americans are going down, in a period when America is lagging behind other developed nations in literacy and learning, I hope we will not be used to deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.

Another classic way to use the racial bourgeoisie is as America's punching bag. There is a lot of rage in this country, and for good reason. Our economy is in shambles. Persistent unemployment is creating new ghost towns, new soup kitchens, from coast to coast. The symptoms of decay--the drugs, the homelessness, the violence--are everywhere. From out of this decay comes a rage looking for a scapegoat, and a traditional American scapegoat is the oriental menace. From the Workingman's Party that organized white laborers around an anti-Chinese campaign in California in 1877, to the World War II internment fueled by resentment of the success of issei farmers, to the murder of Vincent Chin, to the terrorizing of Korean merchants in ghetto communities today, there is an unbroken line of poor and working Americans turning their anger and frustration into hatred of Asian-Americans. 

Every time this happens, the real villains--the corporations and politicians who put profits before human needs--are allowed to go about their business free from public scrutiny. And the anger that could go to organizing for positive social change goes instead to Asian-bashing.

Will we be used as America's punching bag? We can prevent this by organizing to publicize and to fight racist speech and racist violence wherever we find it. More importantly, however, Asian-Americans must take a prominent role in advocating economic justice. We must show that Asian-Americans are allies of the working poor, of the unemployed, of the ghetto teenager. If we can show our commitment to ending the economic upheaval that feeds anti-Asian sentiment, the displaced rage that terrorizes Asian-Americans will turn upon more deserving targets. If we can show sensitivity to the culture and needs of other people of color when we do business in their communities, we will maintain our welcome there, as we have in the past. I hope we can do this so we can put an end to being used as America's punching bag.

The problem of displaced anger is also an internal problem for Asian- Americans. You know the story: the Japanese pick on the Okinawans; the Chinese pick on the Filipinos; the Samoans pick on the Laotians. On the plantations we scabbed on each other's strikes. In Chinatown, we've competed over space. There are Asian men who batter Asian women, Asian parents who batter their children. There is homophobia in our communities--tied to a deep fear that we are already so marginalized by white society that any additional difference is intolerable. I've heard of straight Asian men say they feel so emasculated by white society, that they cannot tolerate assertive women or sexually ambiguous men. This is a victim's mentality; the tragic symptom of a community so devoid of self respect that it brings its anger home.

I love my Asian brothers, but I've lost my patience with malingering homophobia and sexism, and especially with using white racism as an excuse to resist change. You know, the ""I have to be Bruce Lee because the white man wants me to be Tonto"" line. Yes, the J-town boys with their black leather jackets are adorable, but the pathetic need to put down straight women, gays, and lesbians is not. To anyone in our communities who wants to bring their anger home, let's say, ""cut it out."" We will not be used against each other.

If you know Hawaiian music, you know of the ha'ina line that tells of a song about to end. This speech is about to end. It will end by recalling echoes of Asian-American resistance.

In anti-eviction struggles in Chinatowns from coast to coast and in Hawaii we heard the song, ""We Shall Not Be Moved.""  For the 90's, I want to sing, ""We Shall Not Be Used."" I want to remember the times when Asian-Americans stood side-by-side with African-Americans, Latinos, and progressive whites to demand social justice. I want to remember the multi-racial ILWU (International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Workers' Union) that ended the plantation system in Hawaii.  I want to remember the multi-racial sugar beet strikes in California that brought together Japanese, Filipino and Chicano workers to fulfill their dreams of a better life.  I want to remember the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born that brought together progressive Okinawan, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and European immigrants to fight McCarthyism and deportation of political activists.  I want to remember the San Francisco State College strike, and the Asian-American students who stood their ground in a multi-racial coalition to bring about ethnic studies and lasting changes in American academic life, changes that make it possible for me, as a scholar, to tell the truth as I see it.

In remembering the San Francisco State strike, I also want to remember Dr. Hayakawa and ask what he represented.  For a variety of historical and cultural reasons, Asian-Americans are particularly susceptible to being used by the dominant society. Nonetheless, we have resisted being used; we have joined time and again in the struggle for democracy in America. The Asian Law Caucus represents that tradition. The Caucus is a concrete manifestation of the pledge to seek a better life for the least advantaged and to work in coalition with other groups. All of you who support the Caucus help keep alive a utopian vision of a world free from racism and poverty. You honor the proudest moments in our collective histories.

When I told a friend about this speech, he sent me a newsclipping from the Chronicle about Asian-Americans as the retailer's dream.  It starts out, ""[t]hey're young, [t]hey're single, [t]hey're college educated and on the whitecollar track. And they like to shop for fun."" Does that describe you? Well, it may describe me, too. But I hope there is more to Asian-American identity than that. I hope we will be known to history as a people who remembered the hard road of their ancestors, and who shared, therefore, a special commitment to social justice.

This song is now at an end, a song of my hope that we will not be used.","asianamerican",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/5cudq1/we_will_not_be_used_are_asianamericans_the_racial/"

Florida banned in 2001 but I couldn't find data for Asians.

The state of Michigan banned affirmative action in 2006, and the Asian enrollment remained relatively consistent (12-13%) at the University of Michigan.  They simply took more ""unknowns"" and other minorities while taking less African Americans.

Ultimately, It looks like it really depends on the state and area.

"2023-01-07",1673066339,"need advice and insights on traditional mother in law","hi all! I have been in this r/ for a while and you guys are super helpful with some life's commonly asked questions! Disclaimer is that I am 23 F Chinese American (upper middle class family) and my bf is 25M Vietnamese (child of refugees, working class).

I am currently in a stable relationship with a man I absolutely love. he is emotionally intelligent, does 50% and more of the housework, is smart, and has fulfilling hobbies. We currently live together with a dog. There are no issues in our relationship and if there are petty arguments, they are resolved in 30 minutes. So far I have visited his family twice and I have not sensed any fundamental moral problems in the family and they are really funny and love me as their own. 

However, his family is more traditionally minded, which means that I am policed about the way I dress, if I do less chores than him (for example, if he does the dishes after we all eat rather than me) they'll say something about it, and just general East Asian conservatism and gender roles. His mom pulled me aside several times about the way I dressed over the holidays (I was wearing baggier winter clothing during the holiday season, like a grey hoodie or an oversized sweater) and said that I need to look better or else other people will gossip about the family, or I cannot look ""bigger than him"", or that I need to dress up to keep him because men will look elsewhere if women do not dress up, or I need to dress up before I have children because ""things will sag"". One other time during the same trip she said don't come back if you are as big (body wise) as you are this year. (I am 5 7 and 150 pounds, which I guess is obese by asian standards, and most of this weight I gained due to mental health issues over the years which I did not reveal to her, and I have lost a lot of it already due to recovery from aforementioned issues). Just lectures like that which my own mom probably would never say to me in such an old schooled way, let alone someone her kid is dating.

However, his mom has also been really sweet and caring. She makes me amazing food and cares about my health, what I am doing, and make jokes with me. His entire family is very kind, hardworking, and went through some serious ish to settle down in America. As someone who is from a less traditional Asian family I am seriously kind of baffled about this contradiction between these gender role oriented comments and the lovely actions they have. Over time I have also became much closer with her just from sharing our times together, and she also tells me a lot about her past. My bf's family is also insanely tight knit and cooperative, and the kids do chores, and the guys in the family help out with chores and housework which is really amazing. 

My own mom is more ""words of affirmation"" oriented, she compliments me a lot and she is also more Western. She was also a single mom which contributed to her ""independent woman"" mindset. So I was quite surprised about my bf's mom. 

I have spoken with my boyfriend several times about this. My boyfriend apologetically explained that it's just ""the way his family has been raised, they are already more progressive than their own elders, and he has argued w them so much over the years"" and that ""in their mind, they just want you to be better, what you can do is you learn from what's good about what she said and ignore what's bad about it"" but it left a pretty uncomfortable taste in my mouth because as a woman, I feel like my experience in this situation is different from his. He probably does not have to feel the negative impact of gender roles the way I do. I also felt bad because what if I get married to this family, and the negative feelings get worse? However, is this also a normal part of any relationship? So I thought I'd ask this thread how you guys think. Is this a red flag or should I deal with it? Anybody else has a similar experience?

"2014-01-14",1389675579,"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","When I see AAs arguing against affirmative action, most immediately go with the assumption that this is a conflict between minorities. They see their opponents are other underprivileged minorities who gets all the positions that they didn't get. The proposed solution that they give is always complete abolition, which I see as unlikely, especially in more liberal states.

I think the angle of approach to this issue needs to change in order to convince more people. Don't think of this problem as a dog-eat-dog contest between minorities. There are actually fairly good arguments for helping historically disadvantaged African Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to defeat it.

Instead the really unfair part of affirmative action (for me) is the fact that AAs actually have a HARDER time than Caucasians in this system. This makes absolutely no sense. Caucasians get white privilege, pre-existing old-boy social networks and historical legacy benefits, while AAs suffered historical discrimination and higher poverty rate, AND they should be given an even harder time now compared to white people? I am really surprised and disgruntled that this is not pointed out more whenever affirmative action is brought up.

If the admission rates of Caucasians and AAs for colleges are on the same level adjusted for test score (or in some better measure of admission equality, we are equal), I would be perfectly fine with affirmative action. It is a reasonable statement that white people don't need a crutch in life over Asians, right?

This point could have been chewed to death in some AA blog circles. I haven't been in the AA activism community for too long, so it is likely that I missed it.

That combined with the need to have diverse females and males screws over Asians. I was told by a former UPenn admissions officer that the worst demographic to be is Asian Male for all the reasons you can think of.

The NYT article Little Asia on the Hill explores the little known problem of Affirmative Action that affects Asian Americans. The article begins by describing how UC Berkley had a record high for Asians in their freshman class and what it was like for a student to be among such a large population of Asian students in the university.

&gt;    But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it  specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.

There have been long running suspicions among the Asian American community that they were often denied admission or wait-listed to make room for other students considered to be disadvantaged minorities. I find it interesting that although universities pride themselves on being tolerant and diverse, their admissions office uses a combination of stereotypes and impossible standards to create what they believe to be an incoming class with perfect diversity. It seems absurd that admissions officials would assess an Asian student at a much higher standard than his White counterparts because they are a supposedly superior Model Minority while judging African-Americans and Hispanics at a much lower standard using Whites as a neutral benchmark because they are implied to be inferior disadvantaged minorities. Additionally, it is even more racist to use Whites as a neutral standard in judging which groups are superior to receive harder burdens from the admissions officers, while using a lesser standard on the other groups, which appear to reaffirm the age-old American perception that Asians are superior while Blacks/Hispanics are not.

&gt;    Asians have become the new Jews, in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, The Price of Admission: How Americas Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges  and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.

&gt;    As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent)  despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.

&gt;    To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.

&gt;    This is just a very, very egregious system, Mr. Li told me. Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.

&gt;    To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.

&gt;    Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. Im not seeking anything personally, he says. Im happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.","asianamerican",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1juzmv/affirmative_action_harming_asians_most/"

"2022-02-17",1645084351,"An observation about gun ownership and hate crimes","As Asian Americans, we are all increasingly scared to walk down the street in fear of getting stabbed, hit with a blunt object, shot at, shoved in front of a vehicle, etc. A big problem is that there are no immediate remedies to this. You could not go outside and work remotely, but you might need to go to the store or something. It is also uncertain whether the soft on crime laws will be changed or repealed. This leaves gun ownership as a readily attainable solution... You don't have a constitutional right to safety, but under Supreme Court decisions DC v Heller and McDonald v Chicago, you do have a constitutional right to home gun ownership for the purpose of self defense. Most states also have conceal carry permits that are easy to get... Don't get me wrong though. In order to end Asian hate crimes, of course this is not the sole solution, but it could be one of many things individuals can do. Gun ownership is also very political these days, but the issue of whether one should take on gun ownership in an increasingly dangerous situation, like whether affirmative action is beneficial or not, is something that should be contemplated and its merits should be scrutinized without the political perspectives sabotaging any sincere conversations that can bring us some useful insights...

For some more context about myself, I'm a college student from NYC but I go to school in Boston. So when I am at home in NYC I feel extremely unsafe. I can walk outside where I live in Boston at 2AM without a problem. But whenever I go outside in NYC which usually involves walking a distance of at least like a few blocks, taking public transportation, etc, I come across people where they should not even be where they are, and extremely often. It is not usual for like 5 homeless people to be in a crowded subway in an average neighborhood at like 3PM, and if you are an Asian person, you know what is likely to happen next. So I am thinking about applying for a gun permit and purchasing a gun. But in NYC in particular, you cannot conceal carry the gun, you can only keep it in your home. Okay, fine. But if there are like 10 threats that you face on a daily basis and you are able to deal a slight blow on the amount of danger you face, no matter how small, I feel it is very logical to take that countermeasure. Of course, even owning a gun is not a passive action. You have to go to a gun range every month and there are a lot of maintenance duties associated with owning a gun. But if you are not willing to allot some effort for self defense in this environment, theoretically, it may speak poorly on your choice of what to consume at the current time and your expectation about the future.

So here is my question to you guys:  
Do you own a gun or know someone who owns a gun? Do you take it outside or just keep it in the home?   
Do you live in a gun friendly state or a gun restrictive state? What about soft on crime or hard on crime states?  
What is your calculus in response to the rise of Asian hate crimes? What is your proposed countermeasure, especially if you are anti-gun?","asianamerican",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/sujd6e/an_observation_about_gun_ownership_and_hate_crimes/"

&gt; * Indians [post-generation] are generally politically right-wing throughout Canada/Australia/Europe. We support capitalism, globalism, social liberalism, and islamophobia. I am vocally against the socialist-left and affirmative action [as is given to Muslims and Blacks].

&gt; * Westernized South Indians generally do not find North Indains or Pakistanis attractive. A lot of racism exists between Indians and Pakistanis. A lot of us dislike Bollywoodesque racism.

&gt; * Indians generally have no reason to drop their cultural/religious heritage. A lot of Hindu organizations even supported gay marriage before it became trendy in the west, but I personally disagree with gay marriage.

&gt; * Pakistanis are racially Middle Eastern. They simply dislike the idea of being ""Muslim"" and ""Middle Eastern""; if you speak to straight Pakistanis in more liberal areas, they're happy to identify as ""Middle Eastern"". They shouldn't be used to **represent** South Asian peoples - it's racist.

&gt; * India [and Non-Muslim Asia, like Singapore] still suffers from causal homophobia dervied from colonial-christian educational morals, and it's a duty of the western countries responsbile for the regression (United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and any associated countries) to reverse the homophobia installed by their ancestors.
