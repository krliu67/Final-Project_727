Details in post.","Heres the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deans interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no ones surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission& And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isnt really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

"Affirmative action based on financials","2023-06-30",1688131960,"Affirmative action based on financials","I'm a grad student at Harvard, so not aware of how undergrad admissions works here (not American). In light of the recent supreme Court ruling, I wonder if Harvard can do AA based purely on socio economics. So a student from a financially disadvantaged background should be given precedence over a richer student, agnostic of race. Wouldn't this in any way be a more ""fair"" system than one purely based on race or other such factors. This would also help a lot of black latinx student who are disproportionately from poorer backgrounds.

For sure there's a lot of complexity around this issue; but wondering if such AA already exists/being considered as what pitfalls maybe.","Harvard",29,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/14n0jpx/affirmative_action_based_on_financials/"
"Harvard Extension School for Finance (ALM)","2020-12-27",1609048554,"Harvard Extension School for Finance (ALM)","Hello everyone. As my username suggests, I am considering obtaining my ALM in Finance from the Extension School and I had a few questions about the program before I take the last course needed for admission (I did CORe, so I only need to take Microeconomic Theory to gain admission).

(1) I would like to know about the on-campus recruiting opportunities available to extension school students. Are Extension school students able to participate in career fair/recruiting opportunities open to the college/business school?

(2) What institutional financial aid opportunities does the extension school offer if federal aid has been exhausted?

(3) Do you think that the extension ALM in Finance/Management if done entirely on-campus is comparable to a traditional MBA/MSF/MS. Management?

(4) How has the experience been overall? Did the ALM program help advance your career goals/prospects?

Thanks!","Harvard",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/kkyee8/harvard_extension_school_for_finance_alm/"
