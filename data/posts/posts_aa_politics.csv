"2014-06-08",1402196340,"Affirmative Action for Conservative Views?","It seems like every right wing/libertarian is complaining that they're views aren't getting exposed enough. They complain that it's a ""circlejerk"" and a downvote something or another.And it seems that the mods are SUPER SUPER sympathetic with their complaints.

**So I thought we should discuss it as a community. Do you really think there should be affirmative action for conservative views?**

I for one am absolutely sick of the CNN present a conservative &amp; present a liberal and have them argue both sides. It pretends as if the scientific weight of the evidence is equal on both sides. How many more times do we have to discuss climate change, or income inequality? These things exist. They're real, and the people who are experts in their field have no equivocation about them. There is already a multi-billion dollar industry tasked with helping right wing/libertarian talking points reach as wide of an audience as possible(no climate change, no income inequality, guns guns guns guns, etc). Can we really argue that not using mod authority to make these minority  (on Reddit) views more salient is some great injustice? Or as if there's some great injustice not balancing Reddit with opinions already spun from a billion dollar propaganda machine such as ""weather changes all the time""?

Lastly - I'd like to talk about the Elaboration Likelihood Model of attitude formation. It's premised on the idea that if you know very little about a very complicated subject (""Low Elaboration likelihood), like climate change, income inequality, then you will make your decisions on superficial determinants like who the speaker is, his position, his emotional posture, etc, amount of cognitive ease an argument allows you in etc etc (i.e. simple arguments that need little cognitive resources to evaluate are more likely to be believed). More importantly, you'll use these determinants instead of actual complicated things like facts, research, informed analysis from experts. This is exactly what the Mods are trying to do with Reddit. Their main focus isn't the truth of a matter. They act like politics is some realm divorced from the real world where nothing is falsifiable. And they spend all their time talking about ""bias, politeness, affirmative action of other view points, and concern trolling about the problem of a circlejerk."" And they feel these secondary considerations are the primary indicator of intelligent conversation.

I've studied a lot of research on attitude formation. And almost everything Mods and affirmative action conservatives say is so painfully based off of low information processing according to the ELM. Their arguments are mostly something along the lines of ""both parties bad."" ""OMG so liberal,"" ""OMG you disagree with different viewpoints gosh!"" Instead of actually discussing the peer reviewed evidence, scientific methods, expert opinions and factual information relevant to the discussion. They in themselves are making an argument based on cognitive ease - all viewpoints = better. This is  a simple argument to understand, takes almost 0 cognitive effort, those people who don't know the intricacies between policies decisions will likely just believe that. It's frustrating seeing people with such power follow such non logical views of how intellectual discourse should look like. 

Here's an example. If we were trying to determine the answer to 2 + 2. One party says 4 another party says 5. Instead of checking the math to see who's right, the Mods would have us check to see how many people are in unison agreement and whether we have a adequate variety of opinions. They'll carefully assess the tone of each person. Knowing that there can't possibly be a right answer, so the person who speaks with certitude and dismissal of other ideas, is probably wrong. They'll stress the importance of what the 3rd party that deviate from the two dominant views (""both side are the same evil party"") are saying since their impartiality makes them correct. If too many people are saying 4, they'll say ""It's a shame that we have people disagreeing with others for their opinions. The best forum is a place where people don't downvote others in oblivion just for ""disagreeing. (raise your hand if you've heard this talking point 10 times this week). But what they'll never do is actual math. 

While these secondary considerations have their place in fact finding, they certainly don't deserve a prime seat. And it seems almost all discussion in /r/politics dissolves into this. Low Elaboration likelihood discussions. And then they sit back with an air of worldly intelligence as if this type of discussion is intellectual and asking ""tough questions."" And marvel and how gentlemanly they are to ""view all viewpoints equally."" Even worse, the mods who have clearly never read one peer reviewed article about the science of persuasion, media manipulation, correcting misconceptions and how fact finding in public forums works, will then give others speeches about how terrible they are at understanding how policy discussion works. 

SO I honestly ask. Can we please, please end this madness of only discussing secondary considerations (i.e. whether there's enough conservative views, whether it's a circle jerk), and focus on primary considerations, like whether 2 + 2 is indeed 4 or 5. I know when you are looking at very complicated answers, it seems that there is no falsifiable answer. But this is soooo not true. Whether you like to believe it or not, some viewpoints are indeed right or wrong. We shouldn't be forced to listen to viewpoints that hve **been consistently proven to be wrong** because of a misguided view that these secondary considerations are what makes for intelligent discourse.

Nothing surprising: it's very apolitical, and a nearly identical speech could have been given by McCain if he had won. But I bet that the people who have been fearmongering about this speech, the Glenn Becks of the world, will comb through this transcript word-by-word to find something, anything, to criticize, just so they don't have to admit they were wrong.

Here, I'll do it for them!

* ""When I was young, my family lived in Indonesia for a few years..."" -- RADICAL MADRASSA!! HE WANTS TO TURN OUR SCHOOLS INTO MUSLIN ISLAMOFASCIST MADRASSAS!!!!

* ""Ive talked about your parents responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and get your homework done, and dont spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox."" -- HE'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY PARENTS' PERSONAL FREEDOM IN DECIDING HOW TO RAISE THEIR KIDS!!!!

* ""Youll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment."" -- GLOBAL WARMING IS A FAKE LIE AND AIDS IS GOD'S PUNISHMENT FOR FAGS!!!!! GOD BLESS AIDS AND OUR OIL WELLS!!!!

* ""Youll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free."" -- PEOPLE ARE POOR AND HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY! THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR HELP!! ALSO DISCRIMINATION IS OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT!!! AND ""MAKING OUR NATION MORE FAIR"" SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALIST WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION!!!!

* ""But I was fortunate. I got a lot of second chances and had the opportunity to go to college, and law school, and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didnt have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country."" -- IT WAS ALL JUST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION!! THEY TRYING TO KEEP THE WHITE MAN DOWN!!!! DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE SAID HE ONCE SAW A VIDEO WHERE MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS ""WHITEY""????!?!!

* ""Jazmin, Andoni and Shantell arent any different from any of you."" -- YES THEY ARE, THEY ALL SOUND LIKE FILTHY ILLEGAL FORRINURS!!!! THEY SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO AFRICA AND MEXICO OR WHATEVER!!!

* ""Maybe youll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community."" -- LIKE A _COMMUNITY ORGANIZER_??!?!??! OBAMA IS GOING TO MAKE ALL OF OUR KIDS JOIN ACORN AND TURN IT INTO HIS HITLER YOUTH!!!!!

* ""So find an adult you trust  a parent, grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor  and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals."" -- HE DIDN'T MENTION CLERGY AS AN OPTION THERE!!!! WHY DOES OBAMA HATE CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS AND GOOD ALL-AMERICAN PATRIOTS SUCH AS JESUS CHRIST??!?!?

* ""Im working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books, equipment and computers you need to learn. But youve got to do your part too."" -- 'DO YOUR PART TOO'????! THAT SOUNDS LIKE _FASCIST COMMUNISM_!!!!

I'll be surprised if none of these objections are seriously raised in the next few days.

Constitutional Rights Guaranteed to Natural Human Persons Only and Not Corporations; 3. Public Financing of Political Campaigns; 4. 21 Year Term Limits for All Offices.","**Four Constitutional Amendments we desperately need.**

1. Congress itself shall be subject to all the laws it makes which are binding upon the People.  Congress shall make no law granting itself or its members any special privileges, immunities, or exemptions from law other than those already provided for in this Constitution; and any such special privileges in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered null and void and entirely severable - whether embodied in statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom - immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing Congress from enacting any law or promulgating any rule which sole purpose is to guarantee or enhance the physical security or safety of the Congress, its members, employees, contractors, buildings, offices, or grounds. 

2.  The rights guaranteed to individuals, persons, and the People under this Constitution are guaranteed to natural born human persons only, and no rights whatsoever are guaranteed or granted or implied by this Constitution to corporations or other artificial legal entities. Any and every existing contrary provision of any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom purporting or affirming the embodiment of corporate personal rights in this Constitution in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered  null and void, without effect, and entirely severable immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Congress may also enact legislation to endow corporations and other legal entities with whatever rights, privileges, and responsibilities it deems suitable and fitting, provided that any such rights and privileges granted may never supersede or diminish the rights and privileges guaranteed to natural born human persons under this Constitution. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as absolving any corporation of legal accountability for its actions, forgiving any corporate debts, or nullifying any existing judgement against any corporation in suit at law or equity.

3.  All elections at every level of government in these United States shall be financed by public funding only, except that bone-fide individual natural human citizens of the United States may directly contribute an amount not to exceed an annual total of five hundred dollars to all parties combined to the candidates and issue advocacy groups of their choice. No political party or committee may have any influence over the allocation and distribution of public funds, and the requirements for eligibility to receive public funding shall be the same for all persons seeking the same office, regardless of political party affiliation or non-affiliation.  This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

4. No person shall serve in any one elected or appointed government office, including judiciary offices, for more than a total of twenty-one years in their entire lifetime. This Article amends any contrary provision of this Constitution, and renders any and every existing contrary statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom null and void and of no effect and entirely severable. This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majoritys approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens  through the democratic process  to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution  even as confined to opposite-sex relations  has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on todays social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in todays majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity, I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obamas address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times  a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether theyre marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. Its a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. Its a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. Its a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. Its why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. Its why we ended, Dont Ask, Dont Tell.  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, weve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, Americas shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome todays news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. Thats always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.  
Thats the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.  
  
Thank you.

I was already envisioning some of the jive I could throw down after I drafted Calvin Johnson for the fourth year in a row (my longest relationship ever.) It was going to be glorious. Incredible. Life changing. My moment in the sun without sunblock.  I would finally win a fantasy football championship and stop being applauded for ""trying.""

I was going to ruin everyones Sunday when I trampled his or her team. And Id remind them of said trampling on Monday, and Tuesday, and most likely Wednesday.

But then something happened.  My brother called me to wish me a happy birthday. And with that, we got into our usual political discourse. And five minutes after beginning our conversation with a happy birthday, he accused me of idolizing the values of Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx.

Which made me think about the good old days. Before Sarah Palin. Before Eric Bolling. Before Michelle Malkin. And before the Tea Party& When I could have a civil discussion over politics with someone who doesnt share any of my political ideology. Today, they say I support Communism.

And while Id love to blame Sarah Palin, Eric Bolling or Sean Hannity  all who spew hatred and barefaced disrespect toward our President  they are just a few phony entertainers trying to make a Republican dollar out of our Democratic Euros. 

Its Republican strategist Steve Schmidt who created this hullabaloo. 

Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats in Congress were all just aspiring plutocrats interested in lining their own pockets. They were greedy. But we knew this. We werent stupid. But not today.

Today, the Tea Party is the Frankenstein Schmidt created. And he should feel guilty. He was so desperate to win the Presidency for McCain - he put someone who wasnt qualified, let alone bright, on the ticket for Vice President. In his next life, Steve Schmidt should be reincarnated as a Transvaginal Ultrasound wand in a liberal-friendly county Planned Parenthood. 

But I bet he didnt expect this decision would have such a bombastic effect on the country after their losing bid for the Presidency. Most likely, Schmidt thought Palin would go back to Wasilla and say funny things about Putin rearing his head into Alaska, or nuclear weapontry, or Africa being a state, or death panels, or refudiating the media  anything that is factually incorrect, or words not found in a dictionary.

But she didn't go away. She grew. She got bigger. She developed a following.

Her Tea Party has compared President Obama to Hitler. Palin herself has accused our President of palling around with terrorists. A socialist. A man of no valor. And that's only a few. The list goes on. Donald Trump and his birther fiasco. Although in fairness, Trump invented Trump Vodka, Celebrity Apprentice and eats pizza with a fork (which is a kind of a foreign thing to do, Donald Trump.) Arizona Governor Jan Brewer pointing her finger into the face of our President. Kansas House Speaker reciting a bible verse calling for President Obama to be killed. Newt Gingrich referring to our President as the most successful food stamp President of all time and his Kenyan anti-colonial behavior. Senator Mitch McConnell publicly announcing his number one priority was making sure the President wasnt re-elected. Congressman Joe Wilson screaming out you lie during the Presidents State of the Union address. Speaker John Boehner refusing the Presidents date to speak to a joint session on jobs. Allen West saying President Obama creates economic slaves. Michele Bachmann connecting the Swine Flu to Obama. And the list goes on and on and on.

And even worse  Mitt Romney, who is a moderate at heart, has turned on Yoda, cutting every sensible bone off his body with his red lightsaber and embraced the dark side  all to appease Darth Vader and his cronies - Fox News and their impressionable disciples.

Which brings me back to my point. To them, Im a Communist. Why?

Because I want women to be left alone. Because I want to drink clean water. Because I want the rich to pay a little more in taxes. Because I believe that everyone should be entitled to healthcare. Because I believe in gay marriage. Because I believe in climate change. Because I believe in amnesty for illegal immigrants who were taken to the United States through no fault of their own. Because I believe in free and fair elections. Because I believe in human rights. Because I dont care about religion  but believe everyones religious values should be respected. Because I believe in equal pay for women. Because I believe abortion should be left up to a woman. Because I believe in stricter gun laws. Because I believe in affirmative action. And because I dont believe every conflict needs to be settled by war.

&So that makes me a Marxist?

But then there's the irony when a Republican compares me to a murderer like Joseph Stalin& When Im the one who doesnt want to fight a war and Dick Cheney, Halliburton and countless Republican Senators and Representatives make money off war.  

Which brings me back to my point - fantasy football. I will not play fantasy football this year, but rather  I will donate the $150 to the Presidents re-election campaign. And while I know $150 wont change anything  especially with Citizens United, Im hoping more people like me wont splurge on something this year and spend it on someone who will make your future brighter. Someone who will continue to clean up this mess caused by the Republicans. Someone who will fight for the middle class. Someone who doesnt care who you marry. Someone who doesn't want to utter the words - Transvaginal Ultrasound.  And someone who wants everyone to have affordable healthcare.   

That isnt Mitt Romney. He has now donned the Darth Vader armor  paid for by the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson and the like. And if Mitt Romney cant stand up to leaders of his own party now  imagine what kind of puppet hed become if elected President of the United States.

And Remember, President Obama set forth the greenlight for the Osama Bin Laden mission while embarrassing Donald Trump during the White House Correspondents Dinner  killing Trumps dignity and credibility, and icing Bin Laden, too.

Mitt Romney would need to see internal polling before making such a decision. Or change his mind half way through the mission. Or just promise to repeal ObamaCare. 

Its not Communism. Its not about fantasy football. Its just common sense. ","politics",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zj9r9/because_my_republican_brother_thinks_all/"

Finally someone has the guts to say what so many of the rest of us have been thinking....

 
BUCHANAN TO OBAMA

Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:

First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.

Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.

We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???

Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown , and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids.? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?

Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself?

As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?

Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?

We have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev. Al about Tawana Brawley, the Duke rape case and Jena . And all turned out to be hoaxes. But about the epidemic of black assaults on whites that are real, we hear nothing.

Sorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago.
We are a Christian Nation even if Mr. Obama says we are not.","politics",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9b1by/so_my_conservative_grandfather_forwarded_this/"

"2019-11-20",1574265491,"Megathread: Sondland testifies Trump ordered Ukraine quid pro quo through Giuliani","U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday that there was a quid pro quo between Ukraine conducting politically motivated investigations and getting a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sondland said the connection between these two issues was widely known throughout the administration. ""I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,"" Sondland said in his opening statement. He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on ""the presidents orders,"" confirming Trumps active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.

"2010-10-25",1287991881,"6 out of 10 propositions on my Arizona Ballot are outright lies, cleverly written to deceive voters.","There is a disturbing trend among these propositions:

1) They are written on the ballot in a style that hides their real effects. 

2) Some will permanently take away powers from the voters. 

3) The sponsors reference false threats and fears that do not really exist.

4) They attack vulnerable groups. 

5) They are sponsored by outside groups who want to gain a foothold for a cause, not improve AZ.


**Prop 107: Ending 'discrimination' by banning efforts to close racial education gaps** 

*What the ballot says:* This will make racial discrimination a state crime.

*Real effect:* Will end scholarships, classes and early-start programs designed to inform hispanics/natives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* AZ doesn't have affirmative action! Just specialized education programs.

*Outside sponsorship:* Sponsored almost entirely by Colorado group that attacks affirmative action all around the country.


**Prop 109: Tweek the AZ Constitution to take away voter control over wildlife issues**

*What the ballot says:* Make hunting a protected constitutional right regulated by the legislature.

*Real effect:* The voters will be barred from passing popular wildlife initiatives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* There is no threat to hunting rights, and they are already protected.

*Outside sponsorship:* The NRA was the original and by far the largest sponsor.


**Prop 112: Make it even more impossible for citizens to get initiatives on the ballot**

*What the ballot says:* ""A Yes vote will change the initiative filing deadline from 4 months to 6 months prior to election""

*Real effect:* The wording is almost impossible to understand in this proposition. It would shorten the time available to citizens to collect signatures for popular initiatives. There is so little time already that citizens can almost never gather the required amount. This year, the only popular initiative that was able to make it to the AZ ballot is the medical marijuana proposition. This would end choice in establishment favorites such as photo radar.


**Prop 113: Make it prohibitively complicated for groups of workers to unionize**

*What the ballot says:* Protect the workers' right to a secret ballot.

*Real effect:* Forces unions to have the most complicated form of initiation even though less complicated forms are generally considered adequate and fair.

*Baseless fear mongering:* The worker's right to privacy is not threatened currently, and unions are vehemently against this possible new, expensive requirement.

*Outside sponsorship:* Anti-union front groups. http://www.progressivestates.org/node/22564


**Prop 301: Take all the money from the Land Conservation Fund with no future repayment**

**Prop 302: Take all the money from the Early Childhood Development Fund with no future repayment** 

*What the ballot says:* Please help move the balance of these funds into the general fund.

*Real effects and motivation:*
Jan Brewer always says that she has balanced the budget. In reality, she meant that the budget is balanced if voters approve her two propositions, 301 &amp; 302. Otherwise an 800 million dollar shortfall/deficit remains. These two propositions will take money out of funds to help children. These funds were created by voters and thus need voter approval to be raided. Brewer doesn't want new taxes, except this hidden tax on POOR CHILDREN.

**Edit:** Thank you for your comments. I want to point out that there are other propositions that I do not like. These are clearly worded, however, and therefore I avoided posting them in this submission. 

I elaborate elsewhere in the comments, but here is a good alternative source provided by SporkofThor:

Whether you agree with affirmative action or not, the writers of Prop. 107 should be more honest and portray their intent truly on the ballot.

Were legal and higher education reporters at POLITICO covering the ruling. Ask us anything.","The Supreme Court on Thursday [dealt a major blow](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/supreme-court-ends-affirmative-action-in-college-admissions-00104179) to affirmative action in higher education, striking down race-conscious admissions programs at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.

In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the high courts six-justice conservative majority found that the universities discriminated against white and Asian American applicants by using race-conscious policies that benefited applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, saying the Harvard and UNC admissions programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today. he wrote.

The three liberal justices dissented; with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the ruling closes the door of opportunity that the Courts precedents helped open to young students of every race.

The decision is expected to upend universities decadeslong efforts to create racially diverse campuses. Lets discuss what this means and [what comes next](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/school-admissions-after-scotus-affirmative-action-00104293)  ask us anything.

And it was all a Republican plan, fantasized by Nixon, and realized by Reagan.","[The New Jim Crow] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow#Chapter_1:_The_Rebirth_of_Caste)

&gt;The [1970s] saw a number of issues, such as civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, busing and welfare (conservatives indirectly suggested that the blacks were refusing to work, because they preferred to live off government hand-outs) developing into intense controversies. Nixon declared illicit drugs a ""public enemy number one"" and declared a ""war on drugs"", although no specific drug enforcement policy was yet envisioned and no right wing race and social policy consensus had yet emerged.

&gt;The conservative revolution with the political focus in the Republican Party reached its mature stage when Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980. Reagan issued many implicit, but formally race-neutral appeals concerning crime, welfare, taxes and state rights and his candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by frustrated and disaffected whites; 22% of all Democrats ended up voting for him. Once elected, Reagan proceeded to fulfill his promise of enhancing the federal government's role in combating crime, which at first seemed to be no easy task, since street crime had traditionally been the area of jurisdiction and responsibility of state and local authorities. But the determination was there and the expansion of federal authority posed no difficulty for conservative politicians in this case.

&gt;The Justice Department first announced the cutting in half of the personnel assigned to the prosecution of white-collar crimes and switching its emphasis to street crime, especially the enforcement of illegal drug policies. In October 1982, President Reagan officially declared his administration's ""War on Drugs"", a political move intended to facilitate the implementation of the white right wing's informal race policies that were then assuming a definitive shape, rather than to address the (quite limited at that time) public concern about drugs.","politics",136,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ydma3/the_war_on_drugs_costs_billions_has_created_a/"

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more uniform and effective the prior patchwork of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the [i]nitial registration requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement. §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the [i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b). The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNAs enactment (pre-Act offenders), the Attorney General
shall have the authority to specify the applicability of SORNAs
registration requirements and to prescribe rules for [their] registration. §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNAs registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District
Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to specify the applicability of SORNAs registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders. 

&gt;**Held: The judgment is affirmed.**

The Clintons have a pretty disgusting history of pathological lying, dishonesty, manipulation, corruption, vindictive behavior, and dirty tricks including smearing honest credible people through [whisper campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_campaign).
They also don't mind sending out supporters and surrogates to do their dirty work.  

One of the most egregious violations so far this election involves Clinton ties to MSNBC host Chris Matthews and MSNBC contributor/WAPO editor Jonathan Capehart.

There are other documented accounts of major media organizations manipulating coverage and protecting Hillary. {[1](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/new_york_times_busted_for_anti_bernie_bias_the_iconic_clinton_endorsing_newspaper_slyly_edits_article_to_smear_sanders/)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47z286/memetics_manipulation_and_suppression_how_cnn/)}{[3](http://m.dailykos.com/stories/1499966)}{[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ag1cr/msnbcs_chris_matthews_faces_call_to_suspend_show/d109wmv)}{[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlC31eFTc0)}

Questions remain if Hillary will be indicted by the FBI for hosting a private server that exposed classified information to the internet.  Hillary's server was setup to circumvent archival requirements of the Federal Records Act and FOIA requests.  The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for pay-to-play access involving Hillary's DoS actions in exchange for ""donations.""  {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kt9u/whichhillary_twitter_trend_calls_out_clinton_for/d0dv5mh?context=1)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary is currently under six investigations, but the FBI and OIG investigations are the most severe.  

And if that isn't enough ..

[Hillary displays traits commonly attributed with APD - Psychopathy](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46lyqu/hillary_clinton_i_dont_believe_i_have_ever_lied/d06mmjb).  

But let's focus on what matters, verifiable facts.

**Re: Hillary's email server and the pending FBI investigation**

**Apr 22, 1994**:

[Hillary Clinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOMpU9RriSY&amp;t=21s): ""I've always believed in a zone of privacy and I told a friend the other day that I feel after resisting for a long time that I've been re-zoned.""

**Mar 4, 2016**:  
[Hillary Clinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L70jPvppWBM): ""I've been the most transparent public official in modern times as far as I know.""



&gt; [] /u/Randy334 184 points 1 day ago 

&gt; Wow, so it's possible there is ""No Classified Markings"", because she had her aides transcribe classified material by hand onto her server...


See post by /u/Rhamni for [a good **ELI5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/49wttd/hillarys_no_classified_markings_canard_actually/d0vm5ca)


For the **non-lazy**,

Start with the statements from the IC IG.

Then read ""Hillary's disingenuous claim that nothing was marked ""classified.""

It's also important to point out that the FBI email investigation is completely separate from a secondary FBI investigation into pay-to-play abuses that involve donations to The Clinton Foundation preceding/following actions by Hillary during her time as Secretary of State. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary and her Chief-of-Staff Cheryl Mills [did not sign OF-109 forms upon leaving State](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/16/3037241/).  This was deliberate.

&gt; That statement would have required her to affirm that she had returned all classified materials in her possession.

**Re: Jonathan Capehart (WAPO/MSNBC) smears Sanders civil rights record**  
**Re: Chris Matthews bias and conflict of interest**  

http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-jonathan-capehart-saga-or-why-progressives-hav.html

...

This is an example of the incestuous relationship between ""journalists"" and politicians.

The Clintons have [a history of using journalists to push stories](http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058).   On Thursday Feb. 11, 2016, Capehart published [an editorial in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/) and [sent out tweets](http://archive.is/BCLLM) [check the summaries] smearing Sanders civil rights record.  Capehart repeated the smear claims during a post democratic debate interview [on a special edition of Hardball on MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AshSzj0F-nU) (Feb 11).  

It should be noted that the spouse of MSNBC's Chris Matthews is [Kathleen Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Matthews) formerly of Marriott International, [who worked closely with the Clinton Foundation for four years to open a Marriott hotel in Haiti](http://news.marriott.com/2015/05/kathleen-matthews-departs-marriott-international-to-pursue-new-opportunity.html).  Kathleen Matthews, funded by Hillary donors and friends {[1](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/14/media/chris-matthews-kathleen-matthews/)}{[2](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/chris-matthewss-hardball-guests-have-given-79050-to-his-wife-kathleens-congressional-campaign/)}{[3](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/09/hillary-donors-helping-chris-matthews-wife-into-congress/)}{[4](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/13/ten-thousand-demand-chris-matthews-suspension-msnbc-silent/)}, is running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Maryland's 8th congressional district..  

Watch these vids {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuMnN4wvBY)}{[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqjp8dYOvu0)}{[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMdeXrfkmU)}, Chris Matthews is heavily biased.

This explains how Capehart's smears went unchallenged. A prominent progressive site has called for MSNBC to suspend Chris Matthews for continued shilling and bias. [link removed - it violates the rules?]

Danny Lyon the original photographer, heard of the smears and [posted additional negatives to his blog](https://dektol.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/more-bernie-civil-rights-photos-found) proving the man [in the original photo](https://dektol.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-29-at-6-49-15-pm.png) was Sanders.  On Friday Feb 12, Capeheart repeated his claims live [on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RDTOUJHY). 

Capehart failed to disclose a direct conflict of interest acknowledging [his long term romantic relationship with long time Clinton staffer Nick Schmit](http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-jonathan-capehart-and-nick-schmits-house) and refuses to print a retraction or apologize. It's a pretty transparent hit piece attempting to discredit Sanders civil rights record in the lead up to the South Carolina primary on Feb 27.

To maintain ethical integrity and standards of a news outlet and as a journalist you are supposed to disclose conflicts or avoid them entirely. 

Schmit [has worked for the Clintons in various capacities since 2004-2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20160215055916/https://twitter.com/McSquirmishes/status/699032420029337601) as an employee of the Clinton Foundation, staff on Hillary's 2008 campaign, and subsequently moved to the US State Department in 2009 under Hillary where he has remained as a GS-14 Schedule C appointment [maybe his job is in jeopardy next year if Clinton doesn't win].

Shortly after Capehart's smear campaign, the twitter account [@FauxJCapehart](https://twitter.com/FauxJCapehart/with_replies) appeared. [[archived](http://archive.is/XrGMW)] 

As outrageous and disturbing as Capehart's actions are, the conversations initiated by troll account @FauxJCapehart is probably one of the most hilarious things to come from this election cycle.

**Re: Dolores Huerta: Sanders supporters chanted ""English only!""** {debunked}

**Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHDo-uEIi4

Huerta is a surrogate of Hillary Clinton.  She is a well known hispanic political activist and founder of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. When Clinton routinely mentions support from the UFW that support is solidified by her personal and financial relationship with Dolores.

Huerta made [accusations against Obama in 2008](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/21/1488535/-Dolores-Huerta-did-the-same-thing-to-Obama-in-2008) and [received a $100,000 donation from the Clinton Foundation in 2010](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/300/300048438/300048438_201012_990PF.pdf). [page 33]

After the Nevada Caucus, Dolores Huerta and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera claimed supporters of Bernie Sanders chanted ""English only."" {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1l5SHR4GvE)}{[2](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094857/https://twitter.com/DoloresHuerta/status/701184235315400705)}{[3](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094846/https://twitter.com/AmericaFerrera/status/701166307387928577)} 

[This is false](http://www.snopes.com/sanders-english-only-huerta/).  

A person in the audience noted that people only spoke Spanish and needed a translator.  Precinct Chair Raymond Buckley asked if there was a translator in the audience. Buckley then stated, ""First person on the stage that speaks Spanish gets to do it."" Hillary's supporters shouted ""Dolores."" Dolores walked up to the stage.  People in the audience objected. ""no!"" ""neutral!"" ""she's a surrogate!""  Nevada Caucus Guidelines prevent observers and surrogates from speaking during the Caucus proceeding.  Rightfully, people in the audience were concerned that Huerta, a Clinton surrogate, might attempt to instruct Spanish speakers to group toward Clinton's area.  Precinct Chair Buckley noted the conflict and stated ""we are going forward English only.""  Buckley followed with the instructions, ""if somebody next to you is not English speaking please make sure you are next to them so you can translate as quickly as possible.""

This attack was first run by Clinton supporters against Obama in 2008, in an attempt to disparage the candidate and label their supporters as sexist mysoginists with racist connotations.{[1](http://dailykos.com/stories/2016/2/8/1481627/-WOW-Before-the-sexist-Bernie-Bro-Clinton-supporters-created-the-sexist-Obama-boy-No-seriously)}{[2](http://www.salon.com/2008/04/14/obama_supporters/)}

""Bernie Bros"" is a demeaning categorization for male Sanders supporters first penned in a Fall 2015 OP-ED. The BernieBros myth was further pushed into the sexist misogynist realm by Clinton supporters Emily Nussbaum and Emily Cahn.  Emily Nussbaum is a blogger/TV critic for ""The New Yorker"" and [a self-professed Clinton supporter](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216033537/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/691834775343087616); her father [is attorney Bernard Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_W._Nussbaum), former white house counsel for Bill Clinton.

Emily Nussbaum [was labeled ""a psycho""](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040007/https://twitter.com/TJMitchJohnson/status/691839468710535168) by a single self-described Tea Party Trump supporter with a fake twitter account [@RepStevenSmith](https://twitter.com/RepStevenSmith). {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8Q0RYWGqM)}{[2](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/01/31/greenwald-anti-sanders-bernie-bro-articles-based-on-parody-account/)}{[3](http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/199111-fake-congressman-fools-people-on-twitter)}. [@RussPMguy](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040448/https://twitter.com/RussPMguy) is also a Trump supporter.

Emily [falsely attributed this troll attack](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216034042/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/693452999071526912) to Bernie supporters.
Clinton supporter Emily Cahn [repeated Nussbaum's account, falsely blaming Sanders supporters](http://mashable.com/2016/01/29/bernie-sanders-berniebros/).

""Bernie Bros"" does not exist, it was a troll.  But that isn't stopping the Clinton campaign from repeating the myth like they did in 2008 against Obama.

"2019-06-10",1560169823,"Supreme Court Decisions 6/10/19 Discussion Thread","There are many cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Gamble v. United States**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule the separate sovereigns exception to the double jeopardy clause.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court conducted a proper holistic analysis of the majority-minority Virginia House of Delegates districts under the prior decision in this case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, even though it ignored a host of evidence, including the overwhelming majority of district lines, which were carried over unchanged from the prior map; the geographic location of population disparities, which imposed severe redistricting constraints and directly impacted which voters were moved into and out of the majority-minority districts; and the degree of constraint the Houses Voting Rights Act compliance goals imposed in implementation, which was minimal; (2) whether the Bethune-Hill predominance test is satisfied merely by a lengthy description of ordinary Voting Rights Act compliance measures; (3) whether the district court erred in relying on expert analysis it previously rejected as unreliable and irrelevant and expert analysis that lacked any objective or coherent methodology; (4) whether the district court committed clear error in ignoring the entirety of the houses evidentiary presentation under the guise of credibility determinations unsupported by the record and predicated on expert testimony that should not have been credited or even admitted; (5) whether Virginias choice to draw 11 safe majority-minority districts of around or above 55 percent black voting-age population (BVAP) was narrowly tailored in light of the discretion the Voting Rights Act afforded covered jurisdictions to choose to create a certain number of safe districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice, under Georgia v. Ashcroft, or the requirement the Voting Rights Act, as amended, imposed on covered jurisdictions to prove the absence of racially polarized voting to justify BVAP reductions towards or below 50 percent BVAP; (6) whether the district court erred in ignoring the district-specific evidence before the house in 2011 justifying safe districts at or above 55 percent BVAP; and (7) whether appellants have standing to bring this appeal.

**Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in rejecting the Supreme Courts state actor tests and instead creating a per se rule that private operators of public access channels are state actors subject to constitutional liability; and (2) whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in holdingcontrary to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 6th and District of Columbia Circuitsthat private entities operating public access television stations are state actors for constitutional purposes where the state has no control over the private entitys board or operations.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

It's also on [my blog](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=110).

18 February 2011

Dr. Culver and Ms. Heipp,

I must confess to expressing a falsehood recently. When I learned that a collective day of action was being planned for Thursday 17 February, I logged into the AESOP system to register my absence. I am woefully ignorant about reimbursable days and the like, so I did not attempt to request a Leave Without Stated Reason (as some of my colleagues did). I saw no option for Protest Against Illegitimate Attempt to Revoke Fundamental Rights by State Legislature, so instead I stated that the reason was Illness. But I was not sick.

I could pretend that I really was sick yesterday. Given my history of chronic insomnia (which, I am learning, is woefully common among my colleagues) and resulting illness, I probably could obtain a note from my doctor testifying to a legitimate absence. But I will not do this, because I have too much respect for the intelligence of SPHS and SPASD administrators.

Yesterday I went to the Wisconsin State Capitol building to protest against Governor Scott Walkers budget proposal, which would (among other things) abolish the right of state workers to collectively bargain. I went because I consider this proposal a fundamental violation of our rights and dignity as hard-working people. **As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1937: The right to bargain collectively is at the bottom of social justice for the worker, as well as the sensible conduct of business affairs. The denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy.**

I did not make this decision lightly. As my students and colleagues will affirm, I approach the act of teaching with a passion and reverence usually associated with monastic devotion. Despite the elimination of funding for the SPHS Go Club last year, I continue to offer practice sessions and after-school meetings regularly, without pay. I worked tirelessly to develop and implement the new Interdisciplinary Poetics course several years ago, with very positive results. And, like all of my colleagues, I spend countless hours outside of the regular contract day grading papers and preparing for upcoming classes.

Teaching is not simply a job for me. I need contact with young people. I need to tell them about how writing liberates, about the value of literature, about why East Timor matters. I need to explain to them (loudly) why *Transformers* is a bad movie. I need to tell them silly jokes and remind them that they are glorious manifestations of their ancestors dreams.

I will understand if my pay for Thursday is withheld. Fortunately I have no dependent children or significant debt which compels me to scrape and save each penny that I receive. I also understand that my AESOP prevarication was an affront to the trust between employer and employee. I understand that I must now work to rebuild that trust. (Though I hope the many trust deposits I have made during the past eight years will help.)

However, I ask for mercy as the school and district consider disciplinary action. Had this day of protest been concerned with mere dollars, I would have certainly been in front of my classroom as always. As my students are reading right now in Lorraine Hansberrys play *A Raisin in the Sun*, Mama tells her son Walter that money is not life. Once upon a time, she says, freedom used to be life.

It was in the spirit of freedom and our rights as people that I made the difficult decision to abandon my position as educator for one day. I humbly apologize to the parents and families that had to scramble for supervision or daycare when the doors of SPHS were suddenly closed. I know that my actions have made the lives of other people more difficult, and I ask for their understanding.

But as the old saying goes, an injustice to one is an injustice to all. I believe that we who protested at the state capitol were doing so not only for ourselves  nor for public employees  but for all working people in our state, in our nation. As my sign at the protest said: The state could also save money by abolishing our right to vote, right? But this would be unfair. I expect you would protest if the government tried to abolish this right of yours.

And I would be right beside you.

(TLDR: You cannot possibly hope to understand the vital complexities of our struggle if you're not willing to read more. Please stop looking for shortcuts.)","politics",190,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/foi8h/from_a_wisconsin_teacher_why_i_skipped_school_on/"

Update: Finishing up edits on a story  will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.
