"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"

Turner, an enslaved Black man in Southhampton, Virginia, successfully organized upwards of 50 slaves. On August 21, 1831 they rose in unison, killing roughly 60 slave owners and overseers.Turners most potent weapon?Education.....

After much debate and an unsuccessful vote, the state instead opted to double down on slavery. The lasting lesson taken from Turners revolt? An educated Black person was a dangerous Black person. Throughout the 1830s, Virginia and other southern states began enacting and expanding legislation making it illegal not only for slaves to learn to read, but for free citizens  Black and white  to teach them to read.

In short, racial subjugation is not an unintended consequence of the United States educational structure, it is an integral purpose of that structure.

Its that history that the United States Supreme Courts six conservative justices at best ignored, and at worst chose to perpetuate in striking down race based affirmative action in college admissions via the cases of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.

Central to this study, aside from exposing the fbi as criminally insane, is to briefly describe their peripheral supporters in the general population, including the media and all departments of government, and others.
*
https://www.academia.edu/29056259/The_fbi_Their_Agents_Operatives_And_Friends_Are_Seriously_Mentally_Ill

All who benefit or profit from government atrocities, such as most doctors and 'well off' individuals, are often contemptuous of anyone who criticises the fbi/police community. Such friends of the established authority generally hold that the government can do no wrong and that law enforcement particularly are immune from real accountability because of the presumed danger of their activities. The 'government right or wrong mentality' is an implied admission by 'true believers'  of the criminality and infirmity in  their own minds and in the collective conscience of the  general population.

The *list of sociopathic  characteristics shown below exactly applies to those fbi and police agents, operatives and street thugs sent to assault me everywhere. One should note that some of these fbi hoodlums  are serial killers, serial torturers and just plain homicidal psychopaths who find  an exhilarating and comfortable  home with many benefits in the fbi. So, the reader might see here that their support for the crimes committed by government agents and police may be attributable  (right or wrong) to the people. In fact many citizens readily  cooperate with fbi psychopaths in assaulting me.

As for all others in society who support the fbi and police community, the evidence is clear that our society is dominated by quasi evil people who have no regard for those of us who are targeted for termination by cops and fbi. In other words we live in a kind of war zone here in USA where the occupying forces are the fbi,police,cia, and many in  the general population. See my reports on the fbi As living Dead and see perhaps your profile alongside of theirs.

Furthermore, in order for some citizens to avoid any conflict with the serial killers in the police community, most people who otherwise are decent and caring, present an appearance of 'disinterested' in the atrocities going on all around them. They pretend that all is well in heaven and on earth. NOT TRUE!

So, reports such as mine and others who are being secretly tortured, maimed and killed by stealth are easily ignored and dismissed by almost everyone. This harmful apathy returns ultimately to haunt our society because the evil that many of us report does not stop when we the victims die, nor when the killers die. Instead their evil 'lives after them' and is perpetuated and institutionalized  across our society and around the globe. Such inhumane actions that I outline in my reports coupled with   feigned ignorance thereof by our fellow citizens ensure that public policy favors a violent, unconscionable and monstrous culture orchestrated to control all. In this  culture of popular  indifference to the unnecessary suffering and bad deaths of people by fbi/police/vigilante death teams, all seems acceptable to our sociopathic neighbors until they discover  that, WOW, ""...and ""Then They Came For Me.""

http://www.indymedia.org.nz/articles/6433


As our fellow citizens show no interest in nor accept any responsibility for the crimes against humanity perpetrated in their name and on their behalf by government, I forsee a very dirty response globally from people with a different view of human progress and civilization. USA's unconscionable crime spree, unprecented in human affairs, cannot obtain.

Here is a picture in words of the character of individuals in  government, including congress, administrative agencies, &amp; courts (especially federal Magistrate Judges), and this same composite  now also depicts many, perhaps most,  in our society.

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

{snip}

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}

His dad was NOT the descendant of slaves and came into the US during the tail end of the segregationalist era, and in Hawaii too which is considered one of the most progressive areas at the time and today.

My question is how is it that he, an African migrants child, not descended of slave owners, was eligible for affirmative action? Isn't this a misuse? In fact I Read HBS didn't have a SINGLE afro american in its class in 2015 and 2 in 2016 on collegeconfidential. 

Doesn't this shift affirmative action from poor afro americans to rich african migrants?","education",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/5x2d91/serious_question_how_was_obama_eligible_for/"

Excerpts:

&gt; Of the 27 U.S. urban school districts that reported their results for 2019from Boston and Chicago to Fort Worth, Texas, and Los Angelesnot a single one can say a majority of the black eighth graders in their care are proficient in either math or reading.
***
In a number of these school districts, proficiency rates for black eighth graders are down in the single digits (see Detroits 4% for math and 5% for reading, or Milwaukees 5% for math and 7% for reading). Most are in the low teens.
***
...the countrys best results are still pretty rotten. Charlotte, N.C., is way ahead of the rest of the pack with 24% of its black eighth graders proficient in math. For reading, Boston took the top slot at 20%
***
Of the 100 largest public school systems (based on enrollment), the six that spent the most per pupil in FY 2019 were the New York City School District in New York ($28,004), Boston City Schools in Massachusetts ($25,653), Washington Schools in the District of Columbia ($22,406), San Francisco Unified in California ($17,228), Atlanta School District in Georgia ($17,112), and Seattle Public Schools in Washington ($16,543)

&gt; San Francisco and Seattle arent part of the Trial Urban District Assessment districts reporting their scores. But the other four are, and their scores for black achievement are as bad as the rest.

Urban public school districts have given up on their core mission: to provide children, i.e., to teach and inculcate them, with the knowledge and skills required to become successful and productive adults. Is there another explanation for this failure other than systemic racism?

As someone who isnt THAT removed from my school days and recalls them fondly and crisply, what exactly is going to be done- thats not encouraging fathers to stay in homes or urging certain cultures to value education more- to ensure that we arent seeing black and brown children herded into remedial classes because of things like AAVE when these kids have the potential to be veritable Math and Science whizzes (shout out Stephon Boyce)","education",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/14nb0nc/affirmative_action_didnt_help/"
