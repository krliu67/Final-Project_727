"2011-05-18",1305696563,"The 3 reforms I believe could fix most of our nation's problems."," - State Homes:  Dormitory-style housing where anyone, regardless of income, can find a private, safe place, to sleep, and eat.  Residents will be required to contribute through a special tax on all income (until such a time as the cost of their housing has been repaid, adjusted for inflation) and must provide unpaid service to their building (i.e. security, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, etc.).  Individuals who refuse to contribute will be denied housing.  State Homes can also provide the utility of emergency shelters for the displaced, those escaping domestic violence, the homeless, etc.  These would, in no way, be luxurious -- what I envision would more closely resemble a prison cell (e.g. 7' x 7' rooms) than a condo, and the food would be along the lines of protein bars -- the point would be to provide a safety net which encourages people to improve their condition, without forcing them onto the street.

 - State Schools:  We already provide K-12 education for all, regardless of citizenship.  For those who can prove citizenship, we should extend this structure to include higher education and trade education.  This taxpayer-funded education should not be compulsory and admission should be based on merit.  As opposed to traditional schools which encourage seemingly frivolous educations (e.g. majors with no real market value, ""mickey mouse"" electives, etc.), State schools should focus on skills which are useful to society, and admission to professional programs should be based on projected market demand (i.e. if we expect to need X physicians, only something like 1.25X students should be admitted).  Students who attend a State School, shall be required to pay a special tax on all income, for the entirety of their professional careers.  For certain professions where there is a distinct societal need, but a lack of interest on the part of students, this tax can be waived in full or in part to provide an incentive for students.

 - State Care:  We already provide medicare/medicaid, however these programs are very expensive and do not ensure all citizens have access to necessary medical care.  We can expand medicare to cover all and significantly reduce costs by utilizing State Schools.  Most providers can be hired from the pool of State School graduates.  We can then waive education-tax repayment for those who agree to remain in the employ of the state for X years.  Accordingly, we can pay a fair wage, but a wage which is significantly less than current (2011) prevailing wages for physicians/etc.  With regards to pharmaceuticals and durable medical equipment, we can encourage State Schools to research new drugs/DME, but providing assistance WRT testing.  Drugs/DME discovered could then be licensed out to manufacturers (reducing the cost as they are not doing the research/testing and do not carry such liability) with the school guaranteed a predetermined percentage (I'm thinking around 5%) of the manufacturer's profit.  Manufacturers who go this route can be given a ""profit cap"", whereby they can only mark up the product so much.  After a particular period of time (say 10 years), the drug/DME could then fall into the public domain.  Through this, we can significantly reduce the costs of medical care *while* encouraging innovation.

The homes, schools, and care programs could serve to increase the bargaining power of both American workers and consumers while encouraging competition in private enterprise.  If an individual doesn't have to fear homelessness, they can resign from a particularly abusive employer.  If the cost of higher education isn't so exorbitant, employees can be paid less and still retain a decent standard of living.  Without a captive market, housing prices would drop significantly, further reducing the need for such high salaries in the US, making us more competitive with foreign nations.  Existing industries would need to adapt themselves (e.g. health insurers would need to focus on luxury care, as would private hospitals, etc.), but it doesn't have to put them out of business...unless they refuse to adapt themselves.  And I believe this could also provide a hedge against inflation (i.e. as individuals earn less, and the cost of production drops, consumer prices will drop as well).","politics",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hdzlp/the_3_reforms_i_believe_could_fix_most_of_our/"
"2012-09-09",1347163026,"Lessons from history that all Americans should know","If anyone actually bothers to read this in its entirety, kudos.

Before going to bed, I've been doing a lot of thinking and self research as I find myself becoming more and more amped for the upcoming election.

I think politics can be, and should be interesting, and maybe even fun.  

For all the criticisms and negativity toward government, we should remember we're in quite a new golden age of personal liberties that we, as humans still need to work out the big kinks.

And let the developing world serve as an example of the dark depths of humanity that always have and still exist to this day.

Here's my take on some important things from history, feel free to discuss, call me an idiot, whatever!

One of the common themes we always hear today is the general animosity from the international community toward the United States.  And while it is absolutely true that the U.S. had meddled in some questionable acts such as Manifest Destiny or the ill motives that may be present in more recent wars, we should recall how things got the way they have.

Let me begin with Washington's farewell address, specifically his take on foreign policy.

""It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any part of the foreign world.""

Among many things Washington advised in his Address, this quote interests me.  The founding fathers wanted to stay away from alliances with other powers.  Their problems are theirs, and we have no reason to be involved.

And we, as a nation, generally accepted that through the 19th century.

So how did the U.S. eventually become the hated power that reaches around he world?

We do have to concede that by WW1, the United States already were policing the western hemisphere.  But in general, aside from territorial wars with Mexico and in general preserving our own interests, no large scale conflicts arose.

It is interesting to note hat by our third President, our Commander in Chief was already stretching his powers.  Jefferson himself admitted the Louisiana Purchase was beyond his presidential powers, but pulled the trigger for the good of the nation.

This is important because Presidents have generally been able to stretch their powers in such ways.  They just do it.  But nobody resents Jefferson from doing so, unles you are the Spanish, or the native Americans.

In any case, a significant shift in world power occurred in the late 19th century.  The US and Japan were stronger in power than Europe.  

Remember what Washington said,  about alliances?  An intertwined Europe vaults a small conflict to World War 1.

Let's remind ourselves that, to this point, the U.S. wasnt yet a global power. A strong nation, yes, but not tested.  

WW1 is significant because it forces America's hand into Europe.
But even at the outbreak of war, Woodrow Wilson, congress, and the general public maintained neutrality.

This was until Germany started sinking American vessels in the Atlantic.  I think most people are familiar with the name Lusitania, a vessel sunk by Germany that resulted in the loss of 125 American lives.

After 2 years of no combat, the American PUBLIC was angered and called for war.

If you think about it, auxterior motives aside, it kind of resembles American gen opinion after 9/11.

Congress declares war on Germany in 1917.
Thanks Germany!

At first the U.S. sent supplies, but eventually sent American blood to Europe to end the war.

And that is what happened.  Germany surrenders in 1918.

Woodrow Wilson declared this to be the ""war to end all wars.""

Sadly, we know that was far from reality.

What is important here is that the world looked to the U.S. to deal with the aftermath, a bloody mess courtesy of Europe.

This is significant.  The baby nation, but fast growing America was now dealing with Grandpa Europe.  Imagine your 12 year old brother settling a fight that broke out among the seniors at a family reunion.  It forced the United States to lead the Old World after wanting to remain neutral up to that point.

But fine, let's make some reasonable solutions.  We don't want another war on this scale.

Woodrow Wilson would make a framework for the post WW1 world.

1) his 14 points included a guideline for what the world powers should do.  This included DISARMAMENT, and no secret diplomacies among other things.

2) Wilson creates the League of Nations, a forum where nations could peacefully discuss diplomatic issues.

The U.S. made a strong effort to prevent WW2.  

Wilson also suggested collective security.  
The League would prevent an aggressor nation from expanding by reacting to it.  No nation will try to use force if it meant repercussions at the hand the League.

Did you know the United States never joined the League or signed the treaties?

Congress wanted to reserve the right to declare war.  As part of the LoN America would have to respond to threats abroad, and congress didn't want that.

Fair enough, the United States goes back into isolation.  

The league would become a quick failure since the European nations in it didn't want to commit forces to conflicts outside their borders.

Plus, what's the big deal if Japan conquered Manchuria, or Italy Ethiopia?  

Through the 20's the States still tried to prevent WW2.

President Harding called for disarmament among major powers.  Japan, and Europe was militarizing again.

The present day U.S. is criticized for its many wars, but at one point they wanted to outlaw it.

The Kellogg-Briand Pact stated military force was an unacceptable method of diplomacy.  Modern weapons were becoming far too powerful and dangerous.  

Did you know that in 1928, 62 governments agreed to it, including Japan, Italy, Germany, and the USSR?

By 1935, Hitler accepted a quest for ""lebensraum"" or ""living space"" for his Aryans.  Mussolini was still interested in Africa and Hideki Tojo of Japan was expanding into China.

THANKS AGAIN, the East.  A cataclysm was brewing.  The European powers did nothing until the entirety of Europe was under German influence minus Great Britain.  

Though, at this time the Great Depression was forcing domestic attention even if America wanted to intervene.

In fact, we didn't.  The Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1936 reinforced that the United States shall remain a neutral state.

The American public didn't want war.  And neither did FDR.  He famously proclaimed we won't be sending our boys into battle.

Well, that was until Hitler was approaching the English Channel and Japan liked 2500 Americans at Pearl Harbor.

Germany declares war on America.  

Long story short, the now adolescent America saves the world for a second time.  

At this point one thing is clear.  America was forced onto the global stage twice while it tried to avoid it all it could.  People today criticizing American global presence should know this: your crap abroad forced us off the couch.  

What else do we learn from the past two devastating wars?  That by the time an imperial power begins to make its moves, it's too late.

Also, nuclear bombs are bad.  Real bad.

Even after WW2, though, America wasn't a unipolar power.  Because The Soviet Union quickly caught up to America and looked to spread communism.

Wonderful.  

Enter the Cold War.  The Cold War was cold because the two primary opposing powers never directly traded fire.

We used other means, such as third parties to accomplish our dirty deeds.  

America adopts containment.  An admission of USSR sphere of influence, but a refusal to accept its expansion of that sphere.  Which it tried, and we know by now expansion is bad.  But let's not act like the U.S. hadn't expanded (Philippines).

After the Cold War is when America became the stand alone Super Power.  The rest is history as we know it.

I wonder how history would have changed if there never was a WW1 or WW2?  What if the U.S. was able to extend isolationism?

Just some things I wanted to share, of you're the few who will read this, thanks! And add your input, as responsible voters and citizens of the world we should be as knowledgeable as possible.

tl;dr : America criticized for a lot of things but Europe screwed up bad a few times.

Have a good night everyone!
