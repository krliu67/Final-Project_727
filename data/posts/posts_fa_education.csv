An institution can be held liable for pre-assault claims, which allege that its policies for enforcing Title IX are inadequate, create an environment of heightened risk of sexual misconduct and lead a complainant to be harassed or assaulted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared in a ruling Thursday. The federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex at institutions that receive federal funding and requires them to investigate reports of sexual misconduct 

Three former students who allege they were assaulted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 initially brought a case against the University of California systems Board of Regents in 2015 for Berkeley's handling of their individual complaints. When the case was dismissed in district court, the women appealed.

While many of the recent federal court decisions on Title IX have focused on the rights of respondents, the Ninth Circuit opinion is a big win for victims advocates, especially if other appeals courts follow suit, said Peter Lake, director of the Law Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.

The ruling by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circult referenced a 2014 California State Auditor report of Berkeleys processes under Title IX. The report found that from 2009 to 2013, Berkeley did not notify or give regular updates to parties involved in investigations of sexual misconduct, did not complete investigations in a timely manner and did not sufficiently educate staff and students on sexual misconduct prevention, which led cases to be mishandled and compromised student safety, according to the Ninth Circuit opinion.

Berkeleys use of an early resolution process that addressed complaints of sexual assault without formal investigations also came under fire in the courts opinion. It is standard for institutions to pursue early resolution or mediation between the complainant and respondent only in cases of sexual harassment and when both parties are in agreement, said Jake Sapp, deputy Title IX coordinator and compliance officer at Austin College, in Texas.

The former Berkeley students asserted that only two of the 500 cases of sexual misconduct reported to the university in 2012 were resolved in a formal process and that they were coerced into early resolution by the university. This was allegedly done so Berkeley did not have to report assaults under the Clery Act, which requires institutions to disclose crimes on their campuses, according to the students lawsuit.

Berkeley was ordered by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to revise its Title IX policies after a 2014 investigation by the agency. The university subsequently enacted many new policies, procedures and services over the last few years, according to a February 2018 statement from the university.

But the opinion could open other colleges and universities in the California system and elsewhere in the states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- to lawsuits that challenge the effectiveness of their Title IX policies, Lake said.

Contrary to other federal court opinions that address an institutions deliberate indifference to or inaction on a report of sexual misconduct after the fact, the Ninth Circuits opinion discusses what is known as before theory, Lake said.

If your state system does some analysis and finds inadequacies in terms of response, thats something that they will take more seriously, Lake said. This is a different kind of argument: that the policies themselves shut the door before anyone is able to provide notice.

The door is now open for plaintiffs to argue before theory in the Ninth Circuit. The opinion creates a broader standard than a similar case, Simpson v. University of Colorado, which said that colleges can be liable if there is knowledge of sexual misconduct in a specific program, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators. That case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado.

""It may be easier to establish a causal link between a schools policy of deliberate indifference and the plaintiffs harassment when the heightened risk of harassment exists in a specific program,"" the Ninth Circuit opinion said. ""But we will not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff could adequately allege causation even when a schools policy of deliberate indifference extends to sexual misconduct occurring across campus.""

The Ninth Circuit ruling did note that Title IX does not require California to purge its campus of sexual misconduct to avoid liability and that a university is not responsible for guaranteeing the good behavior of its students.

Sokolow believes most of the higher education institutions in California already hold a high standard for Title IX processes and will be unsurprised by this progressive opinion in the Ninth Circuit. But colleges and universities elsewhere might now look more closely at their admissions policies for special admits or transfer students, such as athletic scholarship recipients, for histories of sexual misconduct.

Its going to not only put individuals in the Ninth Circuit on alert but Title IX administrators across the nation, Sapp said.

Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who represents students accused of sexual assault, said the hope is that colleges do not become overly concerned with pre-assault claims and pursue cases that are not strong enough for investigation and disciplinary measures against accused students.

The hope is that universities will heed this and take measures to ensure that both Title IX complainants and respondents are treated fairly, equitably and given the due process protections that they deserve, Miltenberg wrote in an email.

The case will now return to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide whether to proceed with the claims against the Board of Regents based on the appeals courts new standard.

"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"
"2023-07-02",1688318688,"When Education Is A Crime: John Roberts Supreme Court and Ron DeSantis bring American miseducation full circle","In 24 sweltering hours Nat Turner led a revolution. Turner, an enslaved Black man in Southhampton, Virginia, successfully organized upwards of 50 slaves. On August 21, 1831 they rose in unison, killing roughly 60 slave owners and overseers.Turners most potent weapon?Education.....

After much debate and an unsuccessful vote, the state instead opted to double down on slavery. The lasting lesson taken from Turners revolt? An educated Black person was a dangerous Black person. Throughout the 1830s, Virginia and other southern states began enacting and expanding legislation making it illegal not only for slaves to learn to read, but for free citizens  Black and white  to teach them to read.

In short, racial subjugation is not an unintended consequence of the United States educational structure, it is an integral purpose of that structure.

Its that history that the United States Supreme Courts six conservative justices at best ignored, and at worst chose to perpetuate in striking down race based affirmative action in college admissions via the cases of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.
