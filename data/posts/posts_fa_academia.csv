As the title of this post suggests, I have **DOCUMENTED** long-term medical issues that caused me to tank my GRE scores. I have included the back-story below if you have interest in reading it. What I am looking for is advice on how to work it into a personal statement without it coming off as an excuse or giving the vibe that I am incapable of completing graduate school. I want to make the point that, yes my medical issues have played a role in my performance, but I HAVE done things about it and I think that my scores do NOT represent my abilities. 

Even more helpful, I would be deeply appreciative if someone who has participated in an admissions committee would look over this part of my personal statement and give me feedback. Please PM me if you are willing to do this (I am expecting to write only a paragraph or two)

**Backstory**: 
 Sometime last fall semester (actually I could say it started in the spring of 2011 in a lot of ways), out of nowhere I developed gastrointestinal problems. At first the effects were pretty mild--I missed class some mornings and had episodes of going to the bathroom after dinner, but overall it wasn't too bad. I went to the doctor who told me it was due to smoking, coffee and anxiety, so I quit smoking and I quit coffee and went on with life. Still nothing changed  so I sucked it up and went on with life because I didn't have time to deal with it. Slowly but surely my symptoms began worsening. I missed more class. I started having to visit the bathroom during exams. I started having painful cramps throughout my entire abdomen and back to the point that I would be unable to leave me house. 

By early spring semester the effects had become so severe that my attendance dropped by 50% and I had trouble performing on exams. During one of my thermal exams I had to leave the room 19 times. Yes, **19 times**. This, of course, led to some suspicion and interrogation, but I was very embarrassed about my conditions so I never mentioned it, and just told the prof I had a stomach bug.

This spring was also the spring my research took off. Days I stayed home due to not being able to leave the bathroom, I dragged my computer in with me and did as much work as I could. This led to me winning a few awards and a spot at an international math conference in march. **Oh god, this was the worst experience for me**. I did well at the conference, but only because I self medicated, using 3x the recommended dose of over the counter medicine. This did not dull the pain, though. I continued on because I wanted to, and I had to. It's my dream to be a physicist, and sure it sucks to have this condition, but I made it through and I did a damn good job. 

Of course, at this conference a prof in our group noticed my frequent bathroom trips and told me I should seek out help because I could have celiacs disease (which my grandmother has). Upon my return to campus, as it was the end of the semester, I did just that. This led to a summer of blood tests, colonoscopies and medicinal cocktails. The doctors found nothing. No one knows what's wrong with me (though they prescribed me $1000/mo medicine with possibly fatal side effects...). I decided to take my exam results and visit a campus medical professional who put me on my current miracle medicine.  She furthermore advised me to go to the student disability center, which I did. As of this fall I am officially documented by my educational institution, with a folder full of examination results and my complaints.

So this brings us to now. Over the summer I adopted a very strict diet and have adhered to my prescribed medicine. I have also taken up cycling. These things in combination have basically eliminated my symptoms, restoring my ability to attend and preform in class. I still experience the intense cramping, though, at unpredictable times, especially if I am generally stressed or have come into contact with unagreeable food. 

About 1/3 of the way through my subject GRE, I reached to take my medicine from my bag (which I was told I could have). I was immediately yelled at by the proctor and I was not permitted to take my medication. Not ten minutes later, the anxiety got to me and my stomach began to cramp and I had a very difficult time concentrating. The scores have not come back yet, but I am not expecting anything wonderful. 

I took the general GRE, and I became very stressed out because they told me I would have to sign out (a 3-5 minute process) if I wanted a sip of water or to use the bathroom. This pretty much immediately made my stomach cramp. As this exam is 4 hours long, one can imagine that I didn't fair well. My scores are pitiful for my goals (75% in quant and 78% verbal 4 writing), I am trying to get into a top ten school in mathematical science... and my verbal score is HIGHER than my quant. 

You might ask, well, why didn't you sign up for the accommodated GRE? Well- I tried. I didn't know about my qualifications for this until september. I made an appointment with my doctor, filled out the forms and everything. There was a small error on the application and it was rejected two weeks before my test date. It takes two weeks to get an appointment with my doctor. There was no chance after that, and I did my best to medicate and meditate. Honestly, I didn't expect to have the issues I did. I have been doing pretty fine on in class examinations. It turns out not having access to water and a restroom in a 3+ hour long exam takes a serious freaking toll on me. C'est la vie.


So the net effect of this disease has taken one A to an A- and two A's to B+'s (in a physics speech class and thermal). It has likely obliterated my subject GRE score. It put me at a 75th percentile for quantitative reasoning, despite having a 4.0 in my applied math major (I doubled). 

Its just heart breaking to me. I just worked my ass off for years to have a great transcript, nearly 4.0's in both majors (not in my cume though =/), excellent research and likely a publication in the near future, and it will ALL be tanked over some crummy exams. I really need to counteract this in a sincere way. Can someone please help me?

"2013-05-28",1369705367,"Resuming undegrad study with academia as a long-term goal (xpost from r/gradschool)","Hi everyone. Looking for some advice about getting back on track, ideally with academia as the goal.
First, a brief historical outline.

Starting in fall 2008 I attended a fairly selective school, studying International Relations. As it happened, it wasn't the best fit, and I eventually became depressed to the point where my grades were severely impacted. I withdrew after the fall 2011 semester. In hindsight, I should have left sooner, but a combination of denial and a desire to simply finish kept me there. Because of withdrawals, I left with approximately 3 years of credits completed and a mediocre GPA.

I've spent the intervening time pursuing treatment for depression, and working for some portion of the time. I've been trying to identify what I really want to do with my life. After some soul-searching, I came to the conclusion that my dream job would be in academia. Short version of my focus would be historical demography (History with heavy Geography leanings). As an aside, I'm pretty well informed about the prospects that lead this way, so advice more substantial than ""don't"" would be appreciated.

Anyway, I'm finally feeling ready to get back into the saddle, and try to get back on track, though I don't have the slightest idea about where to start. I'm planning on taking some open-enrollment courses at a local university this summer to help demonstrate that I'm ready to go back to serious study. I don't plan on returning to my original university.
Basically, my questions are: How should I go about getting back into undergraduate study if eventual higher level study is the goal? What should I look for in a school and program? Spring 2014 admission is the earliest it'd be feasible for me to re-enroll somewhere. What should I do until then? Has this whole episode soured things to the point where it really isn't feasible?

"2023-01-13",1673569014,"Seeking Advice for Econ PhD Route","Hey folks,

I am seeking advice on whether I should apply for Econ PhDs or seek a different field based on my academic background, goals, and current situation. I've read a couple similar posts in this community and others, but hopefully people with experience can offer advice tailored to my particular background.

I majored in Economics with a math focus as an undergraduate (about 3.7 gpa), so I have experience in calc 1-3, linear algebra, and a prerequisite calc proofs class for real analysis. It is worth mentioning, however, that I have not taken real analysis, and I don't know if this significantly bars me from admission to most programs. I have scored a 167 on the math GRE after my second attempt. I have finished a master's degree in sociology (about 3.9 gpa), but realized that the more mathematical/policy approach to economics more closely suited my research interests.

I am motivated to get a PhD because I am driven both by the prospect of research and teaching. I envision a rewarding career as one in which I can learn about concepts that interest me, contribute to society's understanding of economic topics, and advance the field. I feel like I picked my research topic in sociology because it was something that was useful to society, not because it was something that really interested me a ton - and I now recognize the need to pursue a genuine interest in a PhD program. I currently work in a fairly well-paying job doing IT consulting work, but I feel like my motivation is far stronger toward learning more about society and policy from an economic perspective.

Regarding career goals, I would love a professorship that enabled me to balance teaching, researching, and writing about my interests on the side. Teaching and research are both very important to me, so I don't want to have to pick one or the other. I don't have a strong desire to be the most published academic or top-ranking professor at an Ivy League. I want to have health insurance and get a house someday, but I have no desire to be rich.

Last year, I sent in about 6 applications and was rejected by every program. For context, these were all top 25 schools except for one that was about top 50. I had great letters and felt like I put together a decent statement of purpose. I did not reach out to any professors at these schools ahead of applying, and I'm not sure how much this hurt my applications.

Here are my questions:

1. Based on my interests and goals, does a PhD in economics sound like something you would recommend pursuing?
2. How important is attending a top-ranked school given the goals I outlined? What is the lowest rank you would recommend applying to?
3. What would you recommend doing differently to increase my chances of acceptance if I apply again?
4. Do I have to take real analysis to have a decent shot?

Thank you so much in advance! I appreciate taking the time to read this post and whatever insight you have to offer!","academia",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/10afk2u/seeking_advice_for_econ_phd_route/"
"2021-12-03",1638510623,"Letter of Recommendation (HELP + ADVICE)","Hello All! I hope everyone is doing well. For context, I am currently applying for Master's Programs and Summer Research Internships, and I am looking currently looking for potential references. I have secured 2/3 references that are quite strong, one that knows me fairly well since it is a fairly small class and is focused on mini-research projects, and my undergraduate thesis supervisor. However, the final Professor I have contacted was one I have published a paper with in the past, and I have reached out to this professor twice already, but I have not received a reply back. 

Presently, I am struggling to find another Professor that knows me well enough to write me a recommendation, as they are all surface level connections from courses I have taken and have done well in the past. I am worried that this will dampen my chances of getting a placement within the Master's Program I am planning to apply to. I would greatly appreciate any insight regarding how heavily graduate school admissions tend to weigh letter of references, and whether I should ask the Professor that has not replied one last time (or is it safe to say that they are rejecting my request, despite the fact that we have worked together)? 

Thank you :)","academia",0,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/r7rwy8/letter_of_recommendation_help_advice/"
