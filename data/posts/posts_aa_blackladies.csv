And how affirmation action allows unqualified people to get a better chance to get into college compared to their qualified white counterparts&& do you guys see how ridiculous that sounds. Some people who are bitter against affirmative action act as though POC didnt even work hard to achieve their goals when thats quite the opposite. Its gross.

Heck,  I dont even consider myself LGBT but I know civil rights for Black Americans are in line on the chopping block. Itll be like the 1950s before 2030.

At a point, we were each given 60 seconds to say whatever came to mind about a specific topic. During my spill, I revealed some personal things on the topic and I guess the frustration was heard in my voice. The host paused the activity, asked everyone to turn on their cameras, and type my name in the zoom chat along with encouraging words &amp; energy. For the next few minutes she asked me to read everyone's typed encouragement to me aloud, as everyone stretched their hands towards me on screen to embrace me virtually. I didn't know it coming into the workshop but I really needed that love &amp; light energy. I was very thankful to the host for seeing me and taking action to affirm me and help me into a better headspace. The communal love of black women is a gift.

I love moments like this, and would love to hear about a time when you had a similar experience. Small or large gesture.","blackladies",56,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/maqaf3/please_share_a_time_when_a_black_woman_you_didnt/"

"2023-09-24",1695527265,"Considering ending a friendship over affirmative action","My friend and I were talking about affirmative action, shes Indian and I'm black (obviously) she said she hated it and that it was extremely racist towards Asians, that black and Latino students are stealing spots they didn't deserve, and that affirmative action is just as bad as legacy admissions. I literally can't look at her the same and even though her racism comes from ignorance and not hatred I still can't look at her the same. Her parents are also extremely wealthy and I told her that a low-income black or Hispanic student with the same grades as her would deserve admittance into a good college more than her.  I literally just want to block her because of how ignorant she is. When I told her that white students aren't admitted on merit either she said ""I know and its just as bad but you shouldn't get an advantage due to race"" and when I said that black people were prevented from reading and progressing in society she said, ""but that was a long time ago"" I can't believe I was friends with someone for so long and they hold these racist views.

It is coming from everyone, especially men.","Black women have always been brutalized historically of course but it seems that in the present age, the more ""progressive"" things become the more automatically hostile people are becoming towards us and it's a strange paradox. This recent affirmative action decision spells out how all of the strides we've made are somehow reflecting a bitter disdain that people have for black women in particular. I am also observing that all races of men have unusually unreasonable expectations for us and become irrationally (and exceedingly) angry when we don't meet them as compared to other races of women.

Is anyone else feeling this in the air? What is happening? I am really worried about people becoming unexpectedly violent towards me and being able to get away with it because no one has our backs at all.

"2021-12-29",1640804947,"Why are people not in favor of reparations ?","Hello so I was scrolling on Reddit, as one does, and came across this poll asking should there be reparations for slavery. I of course answered yes and considering how left leaning Reddit typically is I was expecting the results to reflect that. 

I was wrong. Many in the comments are saying no black person alive today was a slave, how we already have affirmative action and how white people today have never been slave owners. I dont see how that matters at all. There are still repercussions of slavery to this day and segregation was not that long ago. Black people were enslaved for over 400 years with an additional 100 of segregation. Japanese internment camps and the holocaust were not nearly as long. Both groups received reparations. Germany to this day pays Israel. Why do they gaslight us and make us feel crazy for even considering reparations. 

I dont even think I should qualify because I am a first generation American and the child of slaves from the Caribbean not america but I would like to see ADOS receive their just due.

"2021-08-12",1628740729,"Did I do the right thing?","I wanted to posit this here because I feel like only others who have the experience of dating while black could really offer an informed perspective, and maybe commiserate, if indeed Im not crazy.

Basically, Ive been trying to put myself out there and find a romantic partner. I took some time after my last relationship to gather myself and build my self esteem. I realized I made myself really vulnerable to generally selfish men who often took advantage of me, so Ive been hyper aware of not repeating this.

That being said, I had been talking to this guy I met through a dating app, and we agreed to FaceTime tonight at a specific time that was a little late for me, but not anything crazy. I figured it would be short anyways, because the purpose of this call was so we could kind of meet before meeting in person. I texted about half an hour before to see if we were still on, and got dolled up. 

He replied 10 minutes after we were meant to start FaceTiming (so 40 minutes after I sent the message), and apologized for the delay saying hes ready now. I understand, it happens like that sometimes. I tell him he can call but then he says that hes at a store but we can still talk.

This is when I got annoyed and I said, I thought we were going to facetime? And he said We are, but Im just grabbing a few things. I wont be in the store forever lol.  At this point its about a half hour after we were meant to have started talking.

I felt annoyed that this would be our first time seeing each other, and he intended on splitting his attention between me and his shopping. I felt annoyed he was late. I felt like the basic courtesy would be, at minimum, to let me know things ran over time for him and just reschedule. I felt he was basically proposing I wait for him to finish his shopping if I wanted a proper call.  So this is where Im not sure if I did the right thing or not.

I basically told him I was over the situation and I wasnt really feeling like pursuing this anymore, then deleted his number. I dont know if I was too impatient, or to quick to become unnerved. Should I have tried to be more understanding?

Its been tough, dating as a black woman. Im scared that Im letting my frustrations with how Ive been treated fuel my actions, and that Im pushing people away for petty things. Was I right to cut it off when I did?

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to read this and chime in. Im not able to respond to everyone, but I read every reply and Im truly grateful! I feel affirmed in my decision, and reassured about the future. I might devote some more time to just getting out there and doing stuff I like, and hopefully Ill meet someone that way!

Overcoming the discrimination of being black in the US is meritorious. And any adult knows that grades really dont matter. Are the leaders the ones with the highest SATs?

A lot of posts about affirmative action just ooze anti-blackness and I was really getting sick of it.

"2014-12-09",1418090980,"I reached a moment of relief today. I don't have to acknowledge, or give any merit to white people's opinions.","Reddit has always been racist. But with everything going on with Mike Brown and Eric Garner, it's become untolerable. This is my lurk account, but several times a week I've been trying to give statistics and use logic to show these white people/coons that they speak nothing but idiocity and are reaffirming their own racial biases against SuperNegro black people that are somehow killed 21x more often by the police than white.

Then I reached a moment of clarity...I don't have to listen to this garbage anymore. Their opinions really don't matter to me. I've even told a few people that their opinions don't matter because they are not making ANY sort of concentrated effort toward fixing the problem, or raising awareness. Too many white people are comfortable whining about ""black culture"" and black people, when they can name 2 black people they are even aware of, tops (Obama and Al Sharpton). It *really* doesn't matter to them how many black people die, they just need to have their opinion heard because they aren't used to *not* being heard.

But I don't have to listen anymore. I am trying my best to block out the ignorance. This has worked wonders for other things white people feel a need to pipe in on: cultural appropriation, affirmative action (they love pulling that topic up even though it hasn't really affected any of them), black on black crime (they bring this up even though they don't know any black people or care about the fact they die), and lack of representation of PoC in media (they hate when this comes up but don't even realize they are upset because it questions the status quo). 

I don't care what white people think anymore. If they are on some ignorant trip, I'm not listening anymore. I also do my best to extricate anyone from my life that spouts BS.

Sorry for the rant, but I just had to get if off my chest.","blackladies",17,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/2opmcb/i_reached_a_moment_of_relief_today_i_dont_have_to/"
"2015-07-27",1438024288,"If you like cartoons, and haven't watched Steven Universe yet, this post is for you","I really like this show.

Question, why should you watch it? That's a [valid question.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/0/0c/Reformed_Animation_Amethyst_People_Crying.gif) If you're like me, you might count the people of color who show up in the background of a show or movie. But in this show, those background characters? Not only do they exist but sometimes have speaking roles. One of them is even a main character. Sorta. It depends. I plan on making a post later about what it means to be black while non-human. But anyway...

You should watch this show because: It's bloody brilliant it is. It starts off being rather silly and evolves into something bigger than that. It's a kid's show for sure, but it's on the same level as the likes of Adventure Time, only slightly less angsty. And WAY more focused. And consistent. And honestly, it's not like Adventure Time except for the fact it's creator worked on Adventure Time for a spell, and it takes place in that akward genre where adults and kids can like a show *for the same reasons*. What I mean is, you got movies like from Dreamworks where kids and adults are laughing, but never at the same jokes. Whereas you got movies like from Pixar where kids and adults are laughing at the same thing. Steven Universe falls (primarily) in the latter category.

The characters are genuine great. The music is on point. And, to be honest, I've probably never cried so much for any cartoon before. (Though I might be in an emotional state of mind, as I cried during the song about wanting to see a giant woman.) The show is about [Steven Universe](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140830014546/steven-universe/images/7/76/Tumblr_n9c0ysjQid1t5u6j6o1_500.gif), hence the name. He's half human and half gem. Gems being some sort of alien race that apparently can mate with humans. His mother gave up her physical form in order to give birth to him, but he inherited her gem powers from her. His father is a guy who looks like a beach bum version of Homer Simpson. I wouldn't call him a deadbeat dad on account of the fact that he's a part of Steven's life, he just doesn't have his act together. Steven is adorable with his little afro and singing voice.

He's raised by three gems whose relation I'm not sure of. But they act as mother figures to him. The leader of them, and obviously the best one, is [Garnet](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/8/87/Garnet_gauntlets.gif) With thick hips, a cubed afro, and always wearing shades, she's strong and short of words. Which is just so perfect. For while she rarely speaks, everything she says is just right. If something is her idea, she'll let you know it's her idea. If she destroys your shop, she'll let you know she won't come back to help. And everything is soft spoken and loving. Incredibly loving. Fun fact, Garnet's voice actress happens to be a one [Estelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_(musician\)) who happens to be her favorite musician as well. Her parenting style is the quiet affirming sort. She never has nothing but the [right things](http://38.media.tumblr.com/0e6b25240447b70bf3106ec824fa87a0/tumblr_neozsgEeOD1rqznndo1_400.gif) to say to Steven. Though her interactions with other humans could use some work. Even though she's not a human, she's still a person. She doesn't always have all the answers.

Then there's [Pearl](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/9daa50bfac8d8bdac7f9e4e2a9dca767/nvxf3n4/AEYnm1v96/tumblr_static_69imdka9xgwskokwg48k8ogog_640_v2.gif). The one with straight hair, long nose, no hips, you know the sort. I didn't like her at first. At best, she's a samurai ballerina. At worst? She got [problems](http://media.giphy.com/media/10pstxL1VDGbte/giphy.gif). But the truth is they all do. It's another great thing about this series, is that as it progresses the characters become more deep. Even with Pearl, I noticed her magic weapon was a spear, but she seems awfully well versed in swords. I thought that might've been an oversight, turns out there's a story behind it. What is that story? You'll have to find out for yourself. Her parenting style is neurotic to say the least. But that's good, I can't ever argue with safety first.

Finally, there is [Amethyst](https://33.media.tumblr.com/9a866e346a36131bc271adc1c05f5db0/tumblr_inline_nrgdspSu5B1tuq92p_500.gif). Another character I did not like at first. She's gross. By the gods is she gross. And she can be kind of a dickcunt, but to be fair they all can, even Steven. But she does have some redeeming qualities. For example, she can [dance.](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/steven-giantwoman-a.gif) Also, her backstory is probably the most [heartbreaking](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/stevenuniverse-fanon/images/f/fe/Pearl_and_Amethyst_hug.gif) for me personally. Still, she's gross. Her attitude is gross, and the things she does with her body is gross. Her parenting style is more akin to the 'cool sister' mom and all the terrible reprecussions it entails. Thankfully, Steven has Garnet and Pearl to keep him on the straight and narrow. But she's still [gross](http://i.imgur.com/LdZaeqy.gif).

There's more characters, obviously. I mentioned Steven's dad [Greg Universe](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-05/14/18/imagebuzz/webdr01/anigif_optimized-5800-1431641292-19.gif). He's not a bad guy and there are moments when I can see what a sentient magic rock from outer space saw in him. Steven's best friend is [Connie Maheswaran](http://media.giphy.com/media/WhYw5yZLB2Y5W/giphy.gif). Who I think is Japanese based on just exactly one word she said at one specific time, but who cares. And also the two kids who run the donut shop, [Lars and Sadie.](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-04/1/18/enhanced/webdr13/anigif_enhanced-buzz-20795-1427927573-5.gif) They've got their own issues they need to work out, and doing so demonstrates one of the greatest strengths of the show... pacing. Everything that happens does so at all the right times, even the developing relationships of minor characters. There are still even more minor characters, like the different families. Onion's family, the Frybro family, the Pizza family. My favorite Pizza being [Kofi](http://24.media.tumblr.com/60f32d4aac49ab49a09d9df500c09d64/tumblr_n50m0oT2Yk1twfbfro4_250.gif). Yes, her entire family works at a pizza shop. Also, there is a [lion](http://38.media.tumblr.com/d1905a3150613d80a9cc20ff7bf4e908/tumblr_n0ea8cMkq21rkiy6bo1_500.gif). He, or she, just sorta lays about most of the time not bothering anyone.

The show does have bad guys. But it can't really be discussed without spoiling it since they show up so late. In the first arc of the show, it has a real ""monster of the week"" feel to it like Sailor Moon or Power Rangers. Except there doesn't seem to be any BBEG driving them. Sometimes they fight [mascots](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/8/81/Frybo_Dancing.gif), sometimes it's [cat fingers](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/catfingers-b.gif), sometimes they even fight [themselves](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--p98J-1VW--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/rwwf9k3mpliahnoelfbj.gif). But as the show progresses, you notice just how complex it can be, that things might not always be [so simple.](http://media.tumblr.com/d308a114098e584fe76e165ac64a3092/tumblr_inline_nh7promSla1rrosjs.gif) Even now, two seasons in, and there are plenty of questions left unanswered.

But the most important thing that intertwines all of this that makes this show special is the feelings, the emotions. Mostly jokes. Dumb ones. I admit, ""Meat Beat Mania"" went over my head. But it runs a whole gamut. Sometimes teaching kids [valuable lessons.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/993/917/4f2.gif) Sometimes it's [confusing](http://i.minus.com/idTdl4YZ3jfDW.gif). It's got plenty of [action](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/3/3c/Tumblr_nhvzntFA0O1r3mf8lo1_400.gif). And my favorite part is sometimes it's sad. I forgot how much I enjoy being constantly on the [verge of tears.](https://38.media.tumblr.com/6d2a681920d5d0a7ef61e795405ecc30/tumblr_no4zvt1wVx1uueys5o1_500.gif)

In my book, the show only did one thing wrong. One [terrible thing](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1427/41/1427419836424.gif) wrong.

In conclusion... you should watch the show Steven Universe because Garnet is simply [the best.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/925/061/611.gif) She's the very definition of cool. Her deadpannery is unmatched. She even gets the best and longest song in the series. Also, that Steven kid is [pretty cool](https://31.media.tumblr.com/9dbd261341a163c1b2668b1dc418d4ff/tumblr_inline_nkhwhnpD2n1qdo426.gif). All the other characters are great when you get to know them. Though sometimes I [wonder...](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/1/1a/Amethyst_and_Pearl_fusion_04.gif) And really, you should just watch this show because let's be honest, what else have you [got to do?](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/5/5c/Tumblr_n3xur9zo2U1qjna6io1_500.gif)

1. Read up on fascist/authoritarian regimes and resistance (one link I've found helpful, more recs welcome:http://www.nybooks.com/&/trump-election-autocracy-rules-fo&/ )

2. Read up on which policies can go through fastest, how they go through, how they can be blocked (some useful links: http://obamacarefacts.com/&/what-does-president-trump-mean&/ , http://www.npr.org/&/fact-check-donald-trumps-first-100-day& ; http://www.latimes.com/&/la-na-pol-trump-executive-power-20&

3. Self defense classes - take one, organize one. ones happening this weekend in ny are filling up fast. If you're a member of a group who will be targeted by his supporter's and want to arm yourself I'm not gonna stop you, just be sure to get the skills to ensure your weapon isn't used against you. Self defense works if you work it - talk to your friends about your different techniques and quiz yourself on what you'd do in different situations.

4. Suicide prevention - learn how to respond if you see or hear warning signs. learn how to do a suicidal ideation assessment. learn how to intervene without calling 911 and how to assemble a team of support. Make a safety plan for yourself or people you love if you need to (one resource from Icarus Project here - http://theicarusproject.net/&/IcarusNavigatingCrisisHandout&) (I can definitely speak to a lot of this, please reach out if you have questions)

5. Repro health care/general medical care - I want to build up my skills in these arenas - both to be a better bystander and to be able to provide services if shit starts really getting cut. Lola Pelligrino is amazing and is offering some stuff in BK - https://docs.google.com/&/1FAIpQLSdyoMZw8ZuG2K3CQh&/viewform I also plan to to go to this on Saturday - https://www.facebook.com/events/1826783650900082/ I know that I know lots of radical and brilliant doulas who probably have even more good resources on this (teach me how to perform an abortion tbh pls)

6. Figure out what you need to get in order before January (take all docs here with a grain of salt, I've heard some stuff is incomplete or not totally accurate, but you know your body/situation better than anyone else and this is a good starting point - https://docs.google.com/&/1QjiJi4YBbmdnWyTdKDb&/mobilebasic&; https://docs.google.com/&/17Rj40_i39gTuo4hMNNmhToL0&/preview; specifically help w ID changes: http://tldef.org/work_show.php?id=7; another thread for trans people https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/796684713880616961; specific info on immigration: http://www.immigrantjustice.org/&/what-do-next-protect-immi&)

7. Donate to orgs that we will need in the days ahead - larger orgs like ACLU Nationwide and Planned Parenthood Action, and smaller orgs like Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) Many lists available - in NY I would look at North Star Fund's grantees. And look to support work outside of nonprofits as well - more on that soon, recs for places you're donating are welcome. http://www.whatcanido.io/ has a list at the bottom of orgs as well!

Offer materials support to people who need it - Tell your trans and POC friends you'll walk them home or call them a cab if you have money to do so (hopefully if you are my friend you know I would do this but just in case - I will always always do this never hesitate to reach out). Give someone who doesn't have access to resources you do or who is too sick or sad to leave the house your seamless password. Donate to individual's immigration funds, gender affirmation surgeries, rent funds, medical care, etc. Supporting survival of people who've always been most marginalized by the state is crucial.

9. Become an active bystander: I have lots of thoughts on this one and would love to work on a workshop with someone if anyone has more skills. There have already been an increase in hate crimes. It's happening all over, including in ""liberal"" pockets like New York. You need to think through how you will respond if you see someone being harassed. My very brief advice - focus on the target of violence/harassment (ask are you ok, do you want ot come with me, put your body physically between harasser and harassed); get other people involved (say specifically - hey you with the green shirt I need your help, hey I'm going to talk to that woman will you talk to the man yelling at her, etc); think through how you will respond if you freeze and what will help you push past freezing.(one guide: http://www.themarysue.com/bystanders-harassment-guide/)

10. To my fellow white people - Talk to me please. I want to figure out what we're doing and I want it to be more than ""having conversations"" but I also want to really get into how we're having those conversations - many people have reached out to me for advice on how to do this stuff and I'm certainly no expert but am always happy to chat and be support for those convos. Also should we be trying to do some sort of Talk to a trump supporter action  as someone w no (known) trump supporters in my immediate network I want to figure out how to support people who do and get more white people connected w those white people who did support trump? But also, how are we moving beyond the ally complex to more concrete *action*? Let's talk. On that note, connect to an affinity group if that makes sense to you - Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) for white people, Solidaire for wealthy people, Resource Generation for young wealthy people.

11. To my fellow Jews - I am terrified. I am really really like ancestors screaming in my head to watch out terrified. I have a hard time finding Jewish community but I really want to be connected so please please please reach out. Let's share our histories and share our plans. 76% of us voted against Trump. Let's figure out what's going on with that remaining 24%. Let's step up for folks who are being more directly targeted in areas where we are not, and stay aware of and vigilant about anti-semitism. (and, for Jews and non Jews if you're confused about what anti semitism looks like and how this has been a virulently anti-semitic campaign here's one link let me know if you need more https://www.buzzfeed.com/&/anti-semitism-has-emerged-from-t&)

12. To my fellow sexual assault survivors - this election was one giant trigger, and I think I for some reason felt embarrassed to admit that. I didn't want to admit that he was getting to me on that level. But he did and he will and let's not hide or pretend we're not affected let's stick with each other.

13. Get more of a grip on local politics and what can be changed on a local level, soon. Don't be scared of seeming like a ""bad radical"" for acknowledging that there are REAL IMPACTS on people's lives of laws and who is in power and we need to include that as part of our strategy.

14. Encrypt your shit. Nothing is secure but you can make it more secure. Start by downloading Signal. further guide here: https://medium.com/&/things-to-know-about-web-security-befo&

15. Don't forget to hold on to art and poetry and music and writing. Keep creating and sharing things that are beautiful and joyful and powerful. I'm feeling inspired by Octavia's Brood 

16. Get offline and get together. I'm really freaked out by how isolated myself and others felt due to so much of the election discourse happening online. I don't want that to continue. Talk to each other, get together. Get to know your neighbors if you don't already. I want to see you all. I love you.","blackladies",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/5cfsan/my_friend_created_an_evolving_list_of_what_to/"
"2022-02-03",1643917108,"Forget about Affirmative Action, eliminating SAT scores is what will bring equality and boost black student enrollment in higher education","The conservative Supreme court is likely to outlaw Affirmative action soon,  but behind the scenes, activists have been pushing for other methods to boost minority enrollment in colleges. SAT and ACT have been thought to favor rich students and give them a leg up in the college admission process. Test preps, academic support, ability to redo the SAT many times are some privileges enjoyed by wealthier students. 
 California State University has now permanently stopped using standardized SAT scores for admissions across all its campuses. More than two thirds of colleges in the US including Harvard have paused the  use of SAT. This has increased the number of black student admitted already. 

Colleges that have already axed the SATs are seeing more diversity. For example, 
Temple University student of color community grew to 45%up from 42% just a year ago and 39% the year before that. Both Black and Latinx students were admitted in record numbers.
https://news.temple.edu/news/2022-02-02/message-washington-post-op-ed-resonates-college-admissions-audiences

My feeling is that even if they outlaw Affirmative Acton, and I think they will, we will be alright. The deck is stuck against us but black folk are never asleep at the switch. We already saw the inevitable end of Affirmative Action and started fighting for other ways to help ourselves. California State University had to be sued for discrimination which led to them axing the unfair standardized tests. I think once Affirmative Action is overturned by this conservative Supreme court, colleges will permanently stop using SAT, ACT for admissions.","blackladies",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/sjs5qi/forget_about_affirmative_action_eliminating_sat/"

""Twerking is disgusting and degrading to women. I mean-who would even want to do that?""--proceeds to add the number 1 twerker on vine....who is a non-black woman.

""An attractive black person?""--proceeds to explain that the only reason said person is attractive is due to white features or having to have some 'otherness' to them (I've even heard people say this about Lupita N'yongo-who is as black as they come.) Other races though, they are just hot on their own. 
*Also if you have natural hair, they will still ask if its all real. Then when you answer truthfully that it is real-still give you a look of quiet incredulity.

not all of us are bad is all I see, hear, and read. but the second a black person is attacked or killed or targeted- most white people are looking for ways to blame the victim. 

desperate to find something. When the victim is black or brown and the perpetrator looks white the benefit of the doubt just extends to them. 

and if not that, theres just&nothing. no outage, no gasp, not even a flinch. Just a shrug of the shoulders and a dismissive thats just how things are as they go back to doing whatever. 

that tells me so much. so fucking much. 

every time someone derails a post about black people.

every time someone says they dont feel sorry for us [like we were asking them to? but dont get me started. please.]

every time theres outrage and disbelief whenever we manifest in the media as beloved characters in movies, books, and video games. 

every time they dig to try and find something wrong to knock us down [see charles ramseys criminal past being brought up. see the trayvon martin smear campaign, as if smoking weed is now punishable by death.]

every time they want to say the n-word and become so lucid at the prospect of not being entitled to treat us any kind of fucking way 

just the lack of basic respect. just the lack of basic empathy. 

black people dont hate white people because of slavery. they dont blame you for your ancestors/

they hate you because you show, in countless little ways time and time again, that you sincerely dont value us as human beings.

You only care about racism when you think its against you.

You only acknowledge the shit weve gone through when it suits your joke, your argument, or your analogy. And worse yet, you say you dont see colors only people but then turn around and cite stereotypes like gospel truth. 

Every time we try to do something, try to have something, there is incident.

We cant be president: youll hang caricatures of us from trees [it happened]. We cant be actors and actresses: were apparently so far removed from the human experience that were unrelatable [see: Rue from the hunger games &amp; the backlash. see: potential black johnny storm backlash. ]. We cant do music: youve devalued and appropriated everything but rap, even that you dismiss as not real music. We cant go to college: according to you the only way were good enough to get in is through Affirmative Action which you want to take away. We cant wear our natural hair: its unprofessional and you wont hire us. We cant get jobs period if our names are too black or we sound black on the phone. 

we cant do shit. because you wont let us. 

and you dont care.

thats the kicker. you sincerely do not care. until we get angry and call you racist. then suddenly why do you hate us??? why are you being this way???? 

i know perfectly well not all white people are racist. I dont have any black friends in real life, not on purpose mind you but black kids didnt like me for acting white [you can see the irony] so Ive always hung out with white people. All my friends offline are white. Most of my exes are white too. 

what is the nail in the racist-coffin is that not if you yourself have ever done/thought any of the things i outlined here its the fact that you really dont care that this happens to us. 

you are not bothered in the slightest. 

and when we talk about it you wave your hand or roll your eyes or sigh or shrug. 

as if its burdensome to you. if it annoys you, imagine how I feel. 

but you dont do that. you refuse to even try. 

and that is why so many black people are just done. 

I dont think I can ever hate white people in that broader sense, because I force myself to think of my friends when I do. but lately Ive been getting more and more frustrated. 

Ive been on a blackness kick because I wantred to see just how people would react if i went there. If I broke one of the most sacred-rule of racism and actually dared to talk about it in-depth. 

and all over tumblr Ive seen basically the same thing. that you dont care. but you want us to care. 

you want the empathy from us that you yourself cant even be bothered to give. 

and you think thats not entitlement. 

for the white people who this applies to I dont have anything else to say. For the white people who it doesnt, I hope this has at least been interesting for you. 

but I, myself, am tired. Tired and now depressed. 

goodnight.

"2020-09-04",1599193218,"The Doula Chronicles: Why it can be difficult to support black businesses","I had a baby in July. I always knew that if i ever had kids, I'd want a natural birth with a midwife and doula. Black, of course. Well, I couldnt have my black mifwife. She was $7,000 in cash, and a birthing center was covered by my insurance, and all of the midwives were white. ""OK, no problem,"" I thought. ""I can still have a black doula."" I started my search when I was only 8 weeks pregnant. I knew that connecting with someone would be important, and I wanted to give myself time to find the right one. I found a great one who lived about an hour and a half away. Again, no problem. Labor can literally be days long, and she'd have time to get here when it was time. Because I found her so early, we went a long time w/o speaking. Once I got further along, Corona had hit, but we made a date to facetime, and discuss a plan. She missed it. I called, no answer. She calls back the next day with apologies and says she had an appointment that ran late. Long story short, this happened 2 more times, and I had to drop her. Let me interrupt here by saying a good doula can cost anywhere from $350 (novice) to $3,500 (best of the best/traveler ). I was willing to pay lower mid range, which is a large sum, if you ask me. You do NOT want to give your money to someone who can't manage time, and will prioritize clients over you. She couldn't be on time to a damn facetime call, but im supposed to trust her to make an hour and a half drive to be here for my birth? Nah. So, on to the next. I found another black doula. LOVED her. Military nurse, no other clients, done this for a while,had a real ""black girl convo"" when we first spoke. Simply loved her. She TEXTS me weeks after i hire her to tell me that she got her school schedule, and she couldn't commit to my birth. Ok, can't be mad at that, i guess. But, now, im due soon, and out of a doula. Which brings us to number 3. I tell her everything. The failed doulas, the desire to have a black woman in my corner through this, tell her about everything im going through. Loved her. ""This is it!"" I thought. So, we start the process again. Contracts. Deposits, etc. Red flags start popping up early. This is already long, so I won't go into details. However, there were things she'd say she was going to do, and they'd never get done. She'd text me, id respond, and then I'd never get an affirmative response toward the action. Once I noticed, I would only pay her when I got a response. (Was paying in installments) This was in late May and early June. I was due 7/15. The last id heard from her was 6/12. I reached out repeatedly, and ultimately had my baby, having paid a portion of the fee, sans doula. Now,  she has finally made contact (2 months after my daughter's birth) and has given me SEVERAL bullshit stories about ""trying to reach me,"" and telling me that she was responding to me all along, but I wasn't getting the texts (Yes, really). So now, she's told me that she will pay me tomorrow. I'm already getting BS about her check coming in the mail, and what time it comes, and how I probably won't get paid until the evening. I am beginning to think i'll never get it back. Long story to say; I wanted a black woman beside me for the birth of my daughter. I put my trust in THREE different ones. 3 different ENTREPRENEURS. I want to support us. I buy black owned whenever possible. I dont understand how I can go to THREE different businesses, and have the same negative outcome across the board. Not because of COVID, but because 3 different people couldn't seem to get their shit together. Now, I'm not saying this is a reason to not support black businesses/black women. What I am saying is, sometimes we try our damnest, and still get shit on our faces. Things like this happen, and we immediately say ""That's it, im done, I give up.""  However,  no matter how many times a clothing designer says they don't make their clothes for black folks, we don't give up on them. We'll keep buying their shit! We have to give each other a chance. One black woman does not represent all of us. I want to continue to support as many black entrepreneurs, business owners, creators etc., as I can. But, for a moment, I could see how one could throw their hands up and be done. Because all I wanted and needed in that moment, was a black woman beside me.

Rarely will you see celebrities take any action that might displease their corporate masters. Most celebs aren't as [blatant about it as Laila Ali](https://atlantadailyworld.com/2016/09/30/laila-ali-refuses-to-support-black-lives-matter/), but seeing famous entertainers as agents of change is about as realistic as the idea that [systemic police reform was ever a serious possibility](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html) in 2020 America.

Celebrities always remain a safe distance behind any movement toward social justice, because they literally cannot afford to risk multimillion-dollar brand empires by alienating the mainstream (white) audience.

All you'll ever find from celebrity ""culture"" is the most profitable version of white society that they want to believe (and literally buy into) about themselves.

**Example**: is the average white person racist? No -- they support BLM alongside their favourite stars on social media for a few days after yet another person is murdered by police. They hover like unwelcome ghosts over subreddits for non-white people and can't resist offering their approving opinions or silent downvotes.

Cultural minorities (Native, black, brown, Asian, LGBT, etc.) will never control mainstream narratives beyond what the cultural majority already wants to see.

**Example**: white women are not members of a cultural minority in modern society. Why, then, are cisgender/heterosexual white women (usually middle-class or above) prioritised as unofficial spokespeople for cultural ""liberation""?

In reality, [fewer than half (45%) of white adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/16/support-for-black-lives-matter-has-decreased-since-june-but-remains-strong-among-black-americans/) now express at least some support of the Black Lives Matter movement, [down from 60% in June](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/). They are falling back asleep.

In the meantime, we are told to embrace: ""black whore who loves violent sex"" roleplay rebranded as ""black feminist empowerment""; black male abuse and violence as ""masculinity"" to be excused; happily inoffensive modern Aunt Jemima caricatures as a vision for progress; calculatingly presented ""strong black women"" and borderline ""magical Negro"" stereotypes through Disneyfied appropriation of African imagery, released right on time to capitalise on the middle-class white mood.

**Example**: imagine Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande in the place of Megan and Cardi in the video for ""WAP"". No? You can't? Yes, that's right. It would never happen. Why is that? We already know why (hint: the good white women aren't whores). But Gaga can appropriate LGBT culture as she sees fit since drag queens are cool, and a sprinkling of cringe-inducing ""sassy black woman"" mannerisms are always on-trend for white gay culture. Grande can use blatant brownface whenever she wants, because it's fashionable to be ambiguously brown nowadays (for reference, Ariana Grande is a bright-white person [beneath all that spray-tan](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28337288/fans-accuse-vogue-ariana-grande-darken-skin-color-black-august-cover-instagram/) and cover-up).

Questions:

- What if Megan thee Stallion and Cardi B. role-playing whores in a music video is really just two black women role-playing whores in a music video? What if the ""controversy"" is really just new marketing spin defending ugly old imagery (the _""**Jezebel**""_ type)? What if ""you can't do it to me because I'm doing it to myself"" is really just the same abuse given an internalised excuse?

- What if Lizzo suddenly proclaiming that body-positivity is too ""commercialised"" is just a self-preserving reaction to stem backlash against her for using the ""smiling, inoffensive, overweight black woman"" trope (the _""**Mammy**""_ type) as her primary means to become rich and famous? (Just wait for the ""authentic"" Lizzo makeup kit and clothing line.)

- What if celebrities aren't really our rich-and-famous friends, but rather, corporate brands designed for and largely catering to mainstream white audiences, constructed entirely to profit from the entertaining ""drama"" of our pain and emotional manipulation? What if most black and brown celebrities are just demographically-shifted versions of the toxic white ones?

- What if all the talk about ""self-care as revolution"" actually makes it practically impossible to actually stand up, move and take action to create change -- because the meaning of ""revolution"" has suddenly been reframed as the revolutionary act of repeating self-affirmations in the mirror and taking rebellious selfies?

- What if posting woke memes on Instagram and arguing on social media is actually just complicit participation in mass distraction, while the white male operators of these platforms earn billions from weaponised misinformation and turn a blind eye to violent hate speech?

---

Have you ever wondered why you perpetually feel tired, depressed and angry, rather than uplifted, energised and motivated?

What if everything we're told by the mass media about self-care, celebrity role models and social change is wrong?

Why are we defending corporate brands and lying to ourselves?

What happens after we wake up?

What comes next?

Ive found myself having lots of conversations with them over the past few years where I am reminded that even though were all Black, we dont all view issues of social justice, BLM, the defunding the police movement, climate change, etc in the same way. 

On the police killings of Black people, for example, theyve expressed views along the lines of Well they shouldnt have been talking back to no cop. And I counter with But does that justify them dying over it? 

Or on defunding police, they have a reaction that, frankly, isnt any different from your average Karen in that the notion sounds crazy and why would you want less police protection in your community. Mind, these are folks who grew up in a rust belt city and they saw firsthand when white flight and blight of drugs disintegrate their neighborhoods from the 60s-80s, and how segregation, redlining, racial profiling, and affirmative action affected their families. Yet, a lot of their attitudes seem pretty in line with a more conservative mindset. 

Fortunately weve been able to talk about issues and respectfully express our opinions like grown folks, but a lot of the time I leave conversations a bit mystified and reminded that Black people are *not* a monolith and were just as stratified by generational differences as white folks.

"2020-08-15",1597457919,"Model-minority racism in the Desi (South Asian) community reminded me of an modern version of India's caste system. I wrote a post on it, then saw the book _Caste_ by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson. Have you read it, and what did you think?","From a [Washington Post review](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/running-deeper-than-race-americas-caste-system/2020/07/30/501af19a-c7a5-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html) of the book:

&gt; Wilkerson spent much of the 2010s researching and writing her book, just as the United States was moving in a direction that seemed to validate its thesis. A series of killings of African Americans, often by police officers, helped birth a new anti-racist social movement. Athletes knelt, monuments to slavery began to come down, reparations for enslavement and its long aftermath became a mainstream idea, and the politics of White grievance took over the White House. When she finished her book, she titled it Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Wilkersons thesis is that Americans current obsession with race is somewhat misplaced, for there is a deeper and more intractable system that hides behind the chimera of race, and that system is properly called American caste.

I saw the recently-published book's title before writing the post, but knew nothing about it otherwise.

The post itself is here: [Brahmin, Dalit, Brown, Black: internalising and (projecting/protecting) a Desi-to-worldwide caste system?](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/i5kcwp/brahmin_dalit_brown_black_internalising_and/)

I wrote that post in response to an ugly strain of otherwise hard-to-understand racism, specifically directed at ""the blacks"", among Desi (Indian and other South Asian) people on Reddit.

That repetition of anti-black, anti-Native, anti-Latino stereotypes collectively represent a failure to recognise and resist the model-minority stereotype. Specifically, much of the current vitriol surrounds affirmative action as Asian families have been steered into conflict against African-American and Latino applicants (instead of directing that anger against [white women, who are the major beneficiaries of affirmative action](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action)) for spots at prestigious high schools and Ivy-league universities.

I compiled a post that brings facts beyond the racist rhetoric and [posted it today](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/i9yg4f/when_karen_is_your_real_enemy_affirmative_action/), though it seems to have (predictably) fallen on deaf ears thus far, similar to the post about modern-day caste comparisons in the Westernised Desi community.

That being said, I was recently in a subreddit (not sure if Im allowed to indicate the name ) which was sharing a video about some chic named Amala something. This was clearly a black woman on what seemed like podcast/radio type show. She went on a mini rant regarding Affirmative Action, calling it racist.  She indicated how it was stealing opportunities from people and took away the notion of basing things on merit. The whole thing rubbed me a certain type of way, gave me Candace Owens vibes. What unfortunately shocked me (should we really be shocked anymore?) were the comments. Hundreds of comments in support of this lady, calling affirmative action racist and saying KBJ only got the position due to her race. I felt like I was in the upside down yall. Like people cannot logically think like this right? Sure there may be problems with the policy in certain conditions but as whole it has helped so much. 

Many called out saying they didnt understand the representation matters message that has been spread. Many called this anti diversity saying diversity is about individuals. Majority said job positions should be based on merit. But&.if this was the case then affirmative action would not have been needed. Obviously, merit was thrown out the window for most of Americas history, given the same demographic the only chance. These redditors were something else and made me sick. Dear god, the ignorance and bigotry. Similar policies are here in Canada for marginalized groups (mainly for the First Nations population) but Ive never thought to myself that wow so racist. I need that help too, such lack of self awareness and lack of knowledge pertaining to ones countrys history. 

Anywho, from your Canadian neighbour, I feel for you ladies in the States. I also feel for KBJ (lady went through a hellish questioning and so many dismissed this), she deserves this because she worked for this. I realize that many of us may face similar critiques in our day to day life (whether it be general ignorance or being looked past because of the two strikes against us already), we are doing great. You are doing great. Youve got this far and nobody deserves to dim your accomplishments. Have a great night now. Sorry for any typos.

"2013-12-29",1388287333,"I Just Wanted to Apologize.","I looked through the entire comments section in this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1tuj7z/professor_affirmative_action_is_helping_too_many/

There were plenty people stating that they were hurt and viewed the ""some"" of comments as hateful. I know for a fact that most of my comments are included in that ""some"" and I want to apologize for them. I didn't mean to hurt anyone with them. I don't hate black immigrants, think badly of them or want to hinder their success. I was just fed up with all of the anti-Black American sentiments I've experienced first hand and while occupying black spaces. I'm fully aware of the hate/dislike that exists on both sides. I have had to correct some relatives and Black American friends for their ridiculously ignorant statements. I've also had to correct some Africans who have said some equally ridiculously ignorant statements about Black Americans. I'm also not too fond about some of these efforts I've seen to mend and create relationships, some of them are just overkill. This is for both sides.

My experiences has caused me to become kind of wary of black immigrants. I wouldn't dare treat a random person with disrespect because they are a black immigrant. I just keep the bad sentiments of some in the back of my mind, because I have a feeling that they will eventually manifest itself. To save myself the micro aggressions, I usually try not to talk black politics or distance myself all together. If I come across you, a black immigrant, in the street I would not mean-mug you or treat you horribly. I also have no problem supporting black immigrant-owned businesses. There is a huge African and Caribbean community in my city and they have plenty of grocery stores and restaurants, some of which I go to. I frequent one Sierra Leonean restaurant and always order the cassava leaves. I speak to the owner all the time and he's very nice. I also really enjoy the blend of African/ Western fashion style coming from African designers and have been trying to get my hands on some pieces ever since. However, like I said, I still can't shake the thoughts of how some feel about Black Americans. Owners and workers at the stores I go to are either very welcoming, which I am actually surprised, or distant. They are polite, but distant. I don't know, maybe they feel the same way I do. They are probably wary of me because I am a Black American and due to their experiences. Then you just have some who can be a bit rude and I have feeling it's because of my heritage.

I also thought about my high school friend from Liberia. She used to tell me about how Black Americans and Africans used to literally beat the crap out of each constantly in her middle school. She told me really sickening stories of the fights, her younger sisters and cousins experienced the same thing. However, when I hung out over her house, they were all smiles and treated me nicely.

This is great community for black women of all different nations and cultures who can have a safe place to discuss just about anything. You ladies are also very intelligent and I really enjoy the discussions. I just don't want to make people feel othered for certain differences, when there are plenty of similarities that out weight them. I just wanted to apologize because I clearly hurt and offended people.

Back story: Upon leaving the baggage of high school pettiness, which was two years and a half after moving here with my family, I attended community college for three years and a half. **Shoutout to other Montgomery County redditors**.

I remember vividly being in classes as one or occasionally one of the three to four black students in class. I walked across buildings and cafeterias after classes by curiosity. I observed the subtle changes of demographics by department, especially the STEM, Arts, and Design buildings. Mind you, looking at the names, professors, and faculty were all these white Europeans, white Arabs, white Jews, white Latinos/as as well as the bronzed ones. I rarely saw a Black faculty \[**maybe there was, like your token Black ""*****colleague*****""**\]. My dad applied to the STEM department, with little success \[**I imagine the ""*****meritocratic*****"" BS that was shoved down his throat**\]. The only building with majority Black faculty was the African American department and sprinkles of Black coaches.

In 2016, I started delving into the topic on racism. I remember coming across several articles on that topic. It was so surface-level and theoretical that I felt so confused. I would see waves of interchangeability between Blacks, ""***PoC***"", and ""***minorities***"". I started digging and digging until 2017 where I came randomly across Black authors and writers telling their experiences \[**raw and unfiltered**\] about navigating ""***PoC***"" and ""***minority***"" spaces. It was refreshing to see those experiences matching mine (**although a Black immigrant, not native**), but felt sad that many of my native brothers and sisters in the states were brainwashed with that ""***PoC***"" and ""***minority***"" garbage.

The same ""***minorities***"" and ""***PoC***"" that gatekeep their communities from Blacks are the same ones who scream ""***PoC***"", ""***Black and Brown***"", and ""***minority***"" ***unity/coalition*** once ""***tReNdY***"" and ""***fAsHiOnAbLe***"". These ""***minorities***"" remain ""***apolitical***"" until it's inconvenient \[**like struck down and hard**\] against police reform, affirmative action, school desegregation, the fair housing act, reparations, and so on... But somehow opportunistic leeches can claim the ""***.00000000000000000000001%***"" Black in their blood. The same idiots using/weaponizing Black immigrants (**Africans precisely**) as their ""***scapegoats***"" against native ones ignoring their own dirty backyards back home \[**like they think they're sLiCk**\].

I know my experiences as someone born in the UK but raised in West Africa are the polar opposite of many brothers and sisters starting their lineage in the states against their will. I hope by luck that my ""***future***"" career allows me to lift the voiceless Black voices.

Talking about that \[**Black on Arab/Asian/Latin/Jew**\] ""***ViOlEnCe***"", where does that exaggerated anti-black propaganda come from? For those of my brothers and sisters who come from rough neighborhoods, what contexts and stories do white and non-black medias purposefully leave out?","blackladies",9,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/hf57xc/does_anyone_else_have_an_issue_with_the_word/"

I am a first generation college student and It has been a long road for me because I took so many breaks due to my mental health and lack of motivation. Every day I wonder why I am even still in college and  if it will even be worth it in the end. I am trying so hard to finish so that I can make my family proud but I keep slipping. I often feel like I am all alone when I am on campus. It is a private school and I am constantly surrounded by a sea of wealthy white kids and wealthy professors that i have zero in common with and who don't understand me or don't want to hear my voice. 

I don't really have anyone cheering me on or encouraging me, besides my parents who don't exactly encourage me but instead badger me with constant questions about when I'm going to graduate so they can brag to their friends. sometimes I feel like maybe I don't belong in university and going to college was the wrong decision for me. But then I think about the importance of having a degree as an black woman and it's pretty much the only thing keeping me going. Without some sort of degree i know that my chances of getting a good paying job are slim to none. 

When I think about how much debt I'm going to be in and the fact that even though I will have a degree I will more than likely still deal with discrimination during job searches, it makes me want to give up and drop out. I have been doing research on unemployment rates of black college grads and they are pretty high.

Since I have been in college for so long i have seriously come to realize that universities are racist institutions and they always will be. They merely tolerate our presence there because of things like affirmative action, and the fact that we would add some diversity to the student body which makes them look good. The lack of support for poc, especially poor poc once you're actually there is horrible. I do not feel as though I have learned anything of value. The most important things I have leaned as a young adult are things I've learned from reading blogs online and educating myself. My biggest regret is not going going to an hbcu. I feel like my experience would have been much different. 

I made this post because I felt like there had to be other young women like me who have had similar experiences. I originally posted this in askreddit but got very few responses. How has your college experience been? Have you actually gotten anything positive out of the experience(besides a job, obviously)? How has the post grad job hunt been for you?

Now my heart did understand their personal plight of survival, but my problematic view point just screamed....

1.How the fuck you as a White male homeless when your whole race has enjoyed all the benefits of privilege in America.

2.
Just the color you were born with gives you better credit than me.

3.
You asking for help(money) in a predominantly Spanish/Black part of town to uplift your White ass from homelessness but will probably talk shit about minorities and even call us spics/niggers behind closed doors.

4.
How the hell you broke/homeless, shit all you have do is show up for the interview and you will beat out any PoC for the job.

5.
They only reason you on this side of town(Spanish/Black communities) is because your own people got tired of your bumming ass and you're taking advantage(like White people do) of other races empathy, but I wonder if you would if the tables were turned?

How the hell you as a White woman struggling? Especially when White woman benefit the most from Affirmative Action.

I say because I feel the time of reparations as been passed over. I know many would disagree with me that fine. My main point is not just single entity it's combination of multiple factors.
1. During civil rights and de-segregartion reparations for families was part of the agenda the fact as blacks we many ideas that still divides. We are still fighting from within ourselves i.e family issues friends Africans/African-American or blacks or what you call ourselves.

2. With current administration it has basically changed our future elections are going. Never in my life I have see so many contenders from the Democratic parties and yet still not decided jointly who can defeat trump. I dont know if anyone is paying attention to Republican party but how many contenders have you seen stating they are challenging Trump for 2020. All of them are party or die. You might well that makes Democratic party better, well while did we lose the last election then?? If a house is divided then anyone from the outside can come and take over.  Thanks to Trumps, blacks issues have taken a back burner and now we lumped side as minorities plan. 

Back to my first point am not saying we don't have faults and shouldn't confront them. But when  everyone wants a piece of the cake we are bound to fail. Right the saving grace I smike was the Kentucky elections. I felt so happy.

3. With Trump administration, yes there those of us that lean various ways. Reparations I dont see ever happening.  There are going to be several think pieces outright condemning it and what do you think will happen at your workplace for of us that work mostly non black areas, schools, and dont think some people will think it stopped racism and would challenge it at the supreme court like Affirmative Action.
