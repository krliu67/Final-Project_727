"2018-02-11",1518316187,"Why I identify a Democrat","Hi everyone. The title is a bit misleading. I am a political independent, but after a fairly wrong period of reading conservative sources and occasionally voting for Republicans, Ive come to the conclusion that at heart I am a Democrat and identify with the party, even if I don't always agree with the platform.

Might as well clear out my differences with the Dems.

1. Disagreed with foreign policy. Thought withdrawal from Iraq could lead to destablization of region (which already happened I guess.) Other defense issues

2. At times thought Dems did not give business (including big business) enough credit for job creation.

3.  Not always receptive to idea of private/charter schools which actually can do a lot to help certain students succeed, even if at the price of lack of funding for public schools. Sort of tied in with this has been a kneejerk hostility to faith based initiatives or even faith in general among some sectors of the base

These and other issues have caused me to be way of identifying myself as a Democrat and at least in certain elections made me a swing voter.

But Ive taken stock of things and weighed the two parties and their animating spirits as a whole and found the Democrats superior. Why?

The Democrats as a whole believe in using the power of government as a force for good in the country. They may be wrong ( in my mind) at times, but also very right in many cases.

As a whole the Democratic party seems to acknowledge societal faults and flaws, and their politicians at least admit that they and their colleagues are obligated to draft legislation to remedy those problems.

What I admire about the Democratic Party is it's sense of noblesse oblige, or need of those who are well off and powerful to be responsive those who lack power and wealth.

This is in stark contrast with the Republican party, especially these days. By admission, much of the parties base don't wish to see the government help anyone, or really have their politicians have some higher purpose for being in office.

Democratic politicians consitently advocate a fairer, more equitable society, equal opportunities for people regardless of race, gender, etc, a commitment to preserving environment,  better education etc. etc. . They  may exaggerate what they are able to accomplish, or be insincere about their commitments to certain causes, but at least they hold those causes as their own, and they typically are inspiring ones that encourage the voters to think beyond their immediate if comfortable little world and life

Republicans by contrast have far viewer inspring or high minded causes. I suppose they have ""supporting the military and freedom"" and preserving America from the ""Radical Feminist/Homosexual Agenda"", and that only works if you have a religious worldview that is threatened by either imagined agenda.

Apart from that though, it seems that Republican causes are mostly selfish in appearance, pretty much advocating that government stay out of people's lives and pocketbooks so they can enjoy more of their own hard earned money. Some will argue that they are doing people and society good by cutting taxes on high earners/businesses since if taxes/regulations less businesses create more jobs.

I think its possible that could be the case, but for some reason I don't think the GOP voters desire for either is based off of altruism/ res publica.

I don't think its an exaggeration to say that the average GOP world view is marked by a distinct lack of compassion. Basically it's 1. The poor brought it upon themselves 2. Keep the foreigners away from me, 3.Don't raise my taxes even if education in my area is abysmal.

Even one of the GOP's main selling points, Character/Moral values no longer even hold water. That worked at some level when Bob Dole ran against Bill Clinton, but given the whole Roy Moore debacle, (to say nothing of the Donald) that isn't something the GOP and conservative Christians even care about anymore.

What do you think of my post? I hope I did not offend by some of my earlier critiques of the Left/Democratic Party
