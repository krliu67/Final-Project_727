"2022-11-23",1669218446,"""The shooter is nonbinary""","This is a public service announcement explaining the rules of this subreddit as it comes to the recent Colorado Springs murders and the position of this subreddit on LGBTQ+ people and the propaganda against them. 

As part of their defense, the legal team of the Colorado Springs nightclub shooter has [claimed](https://nypost.com/2022/11/23/colorado-shooting-suspect-anderson-aldrich-is-nonbinary-lawyers/) that their defendant is nonbinary. 

This would avoid them being charged with a hate crime.

The extreme-right has latched on to this news with the jubilant claim that it is not their relentless and vicious demonisation of queer and gender-nonconforming people that is to blame for the rise in violence against them. Instead they claim ""the call came from inside the house"".

Please be advised that on this subreddit such rhetoric will be met with a permanent and non-appealable ban.

Despite the claims of the extreme-right, it is a fact that endless stochastic terrorism from people like [Matt Walsh](https://aninjusticemag.com/stochastic-terrorism-and-right-wing-cowardice-bb4ea455d100), [Tucker Carlson](https://aninjusticemag.com/tucker-carlson-accused-me-of-child-abuse-and-told-the-state-to-take-my-daughter-away-cbf33313bb5), [Marjorie Taylor-Greene](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2022/8/16/attacks-lgbtq-community-amount-stochastic-terrorism) [et al](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/z10z7g/actual_terrorists/ix9830d/). have fostered an atmosphere in the US which has led to a rise in violent threats against non-cishet people.

Their endless lies and hate means that children's hospitals now [receive](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/threat-made-at-boston-childrens-hospital-police-confirm/2895206/) [bomb threats](https://www.advocate.com/news/2022/11/18/childrens-hospital-target-3rd-bomb-threat-over-trans-care) for [normal](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf), medically and psychiatrically advised care. 

It means that [normal, fun and age-appropriate events for minors](https://www.today.com/parents/parents/proud-boys-disrupt-drag-queen-story-hour-kids-california-slurs-threats-rcna33497) are now threatened by brownshirts. 

It means that bills are passed which attempt to [illegalise trans people existing in public](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3729828-tennessee-gop-files-bill-to-ban-drag-performances-in-public-spaces/).

All this and more is the direct result of the relentless stochastic terrorism from the extreme-right. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be clear: Say for the sake of argument that the shooter identifies as non-binary. It is then still a fallacious and unacceptable argument to claim that their actions come from an inherent problem inside the LGBTQ+ community. Instead we know that the murderer comes from an extreme-right family and that their families political connections helped them [evade](https://apnews.com/article/gun-violence-shootings-colorado-politics-springs-ee6fe797a50cfca1bccfcc051c588187) a red-flag gun law. 

With their familial and cultural background the shooter will have been exposed to an endless barrage of anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda. It is not reasonable to claim that their identity absolves the extreme-right from its responsibility in this and similar tragedies, when it is their unending stochastic terrorism which fans the flames of hatred 24/7. 

--------------------------------------

Edit: [Their booking sheet lists them as male and their mother used he/ him pronouns to refer to them while texting them on the day of the shooting](https://www.thedailybeast.com/aaron-brink-pornstar-dad-of-colorado-club-q-shooting-suspect-anderson-lee-aldrich-spews-homophobia).

------------------------------------------

[Fascism](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2017/07/11/on-fascism-and-why-it-fails/) is an inherently empty ideology, devoid of any meaningful belief-system or any kind of concrete and actionable strategies for improving society. [Fascism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism) only cares for power for the sake of power and it cares for nothing else.

Because a [fascist system](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/are-trump-republicans-fascists/) is fundamentally incapable of giving the general public any kind of reasonable platform it must gain and keep followers by creating an out-group to hate. According to [fascist systems](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/11/fox-news-tucker-carlson-documentary-fascism/) it is *the other* that is responsible for all societal ills and only by supporting the fascists in getting rid of *the other* can society be healed from the non-existent issues fascism convinces people that their target minority is the cause of.

Fascism always picks on a vulnerable target. 

The demonisation and villification coming from the extreme-right is doing exactly that. By calling LGBTQ+ people child molestors simply for existing it has become inevitable that people will take up violence ""to protect the children"". 

This subreddit will not tolerate such rhetoric.

Not any of it. 

--------------------------------------------------

- [Drag is not inherently sexual](https://aninjusticemag.com/the-conservative-sexualization-of-drag-55e7d510d535).

- Gender-affirming care is [medically and psychiatrically recommended](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/gender-affirming-care-saves-lives) and proven to improve lives.

- Trans children often know they are trans when their [gender identity](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx) develops, around the age of five. 

- LGBTQ+ people visibly existing is not ""grooming"" and children knowing about the existence of LGBTQ+ people is [not harmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127283/) to them.

- Being [transgender](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people) or [intersex](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/its-intersex-awareness-day-here-are-5-myths-we-need-to-shatter/) is a normal and natural variant of the human experience. Being trans is not inherently harmful to either the trans person, nor their surroundings. 

-----------------------------

This subreddit is a *sanctuary space*.

Extreme-right rhetoric will be harshly dealt with.

So if you want to sneer at people and claim that it was not the fault of the hateful and dangerous atmosphere created by fascist propaganda that violence against LGBTQ+ people is committed then you can do it elsewhere. 

It is not allowed here.
