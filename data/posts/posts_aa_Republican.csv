Athletes like Lebron James and basically every celebrity is using the word ""systemic racism"".  Please don't use this word because it makes no sense.I agree that there are evil racist individuals but the idea that there is a group or system that specifically targets a race is absolute bullshit. It is promoting this toxic victim mentality even more. We aren't living the god damn 1950s or 60s where there are Jim Crow Laws. The government is not targeting any group of people purely based on skin color. CHILL THE FUCK OUT. AND USE YOUR OPPORTUNITIES. EVERY AGREES THAT RACISM IS TERRIBLE BUT ONLY 9 UNARMED BLACK MEN WERE KILLED BY POLICE in 2019. 18 white men were by police in 2019. A police is 18 times more likely to get killed by a black man that vice versa. SOMEONE ElSE WHO COMMITED A CRIME/ would be in jail if not killed but HAPPENS TO SHARE THE SAME SKIN COLOR AS YOU IS BEING KILLED NOT YOU. TO PEOPLE WHO SAY MINORITIES ARE BEING OPPRESED: GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. GO TO COLLEGE. DON'T HAVE KIDS TILL YOUR MARRIED AND WELL SETTLED. AND STOP COMITTING CRIMES. THE PERCENT OF SINGLE BLACK MOTHERS HAS GONE UP FROM 20% in 1960s to over 70% is 2019. DO PEOPLE REALIZE HOW CRAZY THAT IS. 7/10 black babies are born to a single mothers who were irressponisble. CHANGE FUCKING CULTURE. ITS NOT A RACIAL THING, IN FACT WE HAVE MORE AN EASIER EDUCATIONAL PATH BECAUSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. NO WHITE MAN HAS MORE RIGHTS THAN  A BLACK MAN. NO ONE IS ACTIVELY STOPING YOU FROM DOING SOMETHING WITH LIFE.A FEW RACIST ENCOUNTERS AREN""T STOPPING YOU. NO WHITE MAN IS PUSHING YOU WHEN YOU are SMASHING AND DASHING.  ITS CULTURE NOT FUCKING SYSTEMIC RACISM

Edit:

Should I start a youtube channel?

I have some ideas to discuss like:

1.) Are open borders a good idea?

2.) What do the 2020 presidential candidates stand for?

3.) The ""Gender Wage Gap"" explained

4.) Is universal healthcare a good idea?

5.) Is Trump a Bigot?

6.) Should guns be banned?

7.) What should people do about global warming?

of course most of my points are going to be conservative but I won't say that. I'll just examine the issue and point out the facts. and the viewers will decide their side.

**A direct quote from this so-called president from the above article:  To parents of transgender children, affirming your childs identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy, Biden said.**

How is this true? My 4yr old son identifies as a T-Rex (that's not a joke, he acts like a T-Rex). Should I allow him to think he is a dinosaur because he identifies that way? Of course not. Why? Because it's not true, *AND* he's a child and he doesn't know  better.

When I was a child, I wanted to be a knight, then a firefighter, then a GI Joe, then a football player... Should my parents have had me undergo some type of genetic mutation therapy to affirm each of these childish whims?

I think God they didn't. Because I'm an adult and can now think for myself, and I'm an analyst and I like it. 

When your child ""wants"" to be the other gender, tell them what they are. Either a boy or a girl. THEN, if they decide as an adult that they want to transition to the other gender - that's on them. Don't give in to their childish whims and ruin their entire life because of their childhood fantastical whim.","Republican",74,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/tt65dy/latest_in_the_protection_of_trans_people/"

"2022-01-24",1643065125,"Just so Dissapointed","I feel like I'm the most pro-USA guy of my generation. I'm Gen Z, but I grew up absolutely loving America. I donned the red white and blue every Fourth, I exhumed patriotism my whole life. It was a running joke that I was the most obnoxiously pro-American around. But now, I'm apparently a far-right conspiracy theorist. It's just a shame. I believe in the 1776 America I don't recognize this 1984 hellhole the democrats have created. 

I ""woke up"" to the nonsense when Trump ran for President. I knew something was weird when the media joined forces to attack him, when odd things were leaked to the press, and when likely untrue stories clouded headlines for literal months on end. I knew Dems rigged the primary for Hillary. I knew that the MSM and media were exploiting the American people's emotions - pro women, pro LGBTQ, pro immigrant. All of those causes deserve serious attention, but it just seemed so obvious to me that it was all a sham. I would talk to my classmates about why they liked certain policies, and their logic always began and ended with ""because I'm not a racist/sexist/homophobe"". That is, in a nutshell, the liberal morality. There is no positive duty, nothing to actually do, no tangible goal or plan. It's a group of people who just want to tear others down, or force you to sit down and be a part of the crowd so as not to upset anyone. They're a miserable crowd.

Thank God Trump won. Thank God. He exposed all of this. He's not perfect, but he is probably the only person who could have done what he did. He had enough power and money to hit back at the establishment. Nobody else could have hit back, let alone take a hit, like Trump did. Man, he is tough. 

We suffered through four years of Russia hoaxes. We suffered through years of totally basis insults and calls of racism and sexism. The media grew more and more provocative, more and more hateful, and once they had the masses just overwhelmed with this false fury, they stopped reporting facts entirely. 

Trump won the 2020 election. There is simply so much evidence that he beat Biden but for voting dumps, and it is insanity to me that people just went along with the media. It was scary, those days after the election. The media was scary affirmative that Joe Biden won the election. They did not allow any debate. It was certainly an orchestrated thing. What scared me more was how willing people were to just accept it. 

COVID has also been a lie. Obviously it's a real disease, and many have died, however, anyone can see that it has been used by feds to usurp a ton of power unconstitutionally. The actions that have been taken, from closing businesses, to inflating the economy, to forcing the jab on people are authoritarian measures and nothing can tell me otherwise. They were maybe justified to some degree, but I don't think so now, having all the information that I do. 

Why did the establishment do this to us? Why did they go through all the effort to rig the vote, spread a false narrative about COVID, and do everything they can to promote Biden and his administration when all that it accomplishes is the demise of our country? Biden is literally trying to tear us apart. He utilizes the most aggressive, civil war-instigating rhetoric I've ever heard! And he's a god damned fool! His weakness is allowing Russia and China to tip the scales of geopolitical power for generations to come. 

This show, these series of events, which the democrats have set into motion, destroyed American greatness. I don't know why they did it. Did they really do it because they thought it was right? Are they stupid? I just don't get it. I'm ashamed of this country. I'm angry at the people that did this. I want to make things right. I just don't know how. I feel powerless.","Republican",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/sbz4j1/just_so_dissapointed/"

"2023-05-25",1685036014,"Veronica Wu and the corporate cancel culture.","Back in 2020 a successful venture capitalist named Veronica Wu wrote an internal email to a co-worker stating that she felt that **Black Lives Matter were the true racists.** Back then the public wasnt aware of the shenanigans of the Black Lives Matter organization. Its leaders were pilfering millions of dollars and buying multi-million-dollar mansions all in the name of racism.

Worse, their founders were communists who hated America and were hiding behind a catchy slogan.

Source: [https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/black-lives-matter-leaders-arent-capitalist-converts-they-still-want](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/black-lives-matter-leaders-arent-capitalist-converts-they-still-want)

Black Lives Matter was just another con job. Although most people (including Conservatives) agreed with the motto Black Lives Matter, not everyone knew there was a non-profit organization behind the scenes fleecing donors.

Liberals who want to cancel conservatives are usually not good students of history. The Republican Party was formed to end slavery and it was patriotic abolitionist Republicans that left the farms and factories and marched to Civil War battlefields to end the scourge of slavery. There was never any question whether Republicans believed that Black Lives Matter. Without them, slavery would have remained a sacred Southern institution. On the other side were the Southern Democrats who were willing to fight and die to continue the injustice of slavery.

The liberal media, many of them black female journalists, decided to make Veronica Wu a sacrificial lamb and cancel her. It didnt matter that Veronica Wu was perhaps the most successful venture capitalist in the United States at the time helping to create thousands upon thousands of high paying jobs in Silicon Valley.

It didn't matter that Veronica Wu was herself a female minority. Veronica Wu had crossed the line and had the audacity to stand up against the dogma of the liberal left. **And she would be pay dearly.**

This was surprising because Veronica Wu wasn't a media personality. Unless you worked in the venture capital space you probably had never heard of her. And Veronica Wu didn't post her disdain for the Black Lives Matter organization on a public forum or blog -- it was a private email to a co-worker who later became disgruntled.

The disgruntled co-worker knew exactly how to game the system. The co-worker was also a female minority. She simply took the email and shared it with black female journalists who were only too happy to take the bait and destroy the career of our one our best and brightest minds.

Veronica Wu is an immigrant from China and attended Yale and later received a Ph.D Berkeley. She worked alongside some of the most well-known names in technology including Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. Veronica helped form Tesla China and hired the person who is currently overseeing everything Tesla does in China. And before that she was a leader at Apple overseeing an Asian division that increased 50x under her leadership and generated over a billion dollars in revenue.

Her track record as a venture capitalist was even more impressive and included over **34 unicorns that became $1+ billion dollar companies.** The journalists never interviewed Veronica. They simply took the word of a disgruntled co-worker and posted Veronica's private email.

Here is the email that incensed the liberal media and corporate America:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/73mqqfwnt12b1.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9e58702e8f67d2c07e13ce4344cdbb60d56e13e

Source: [https://www.axios.com/2021/09/02/venture-capital-investor-racism](https://www.axios.com/2021/09/02/venture-capital-investor-racism)

The great irony is that **everything Veronica Wu said is accurate!** We should live in a meritocracy. On a sidenote, the groups that are being discriminated against academically are Asians due to affirmative action bias toward other minority groups.

If anyone should be complaining about discrimination it is high achieving Asians who are held to a different standard.

These journalists, again many of them black females, contacted all the boards where Veronica Wu was a director. This included VF corporation and Capgemini. And did those corporations defend Veronica Wu and tell these angry liberals to stop defaming members of their team?

Of course not, the minute the liberal media began pounding on the door Veronica Wu was forced to step down. And the liberal media gleefully covered the story of VF Corporation forcing Veronica out the door. VF Corporation owns such brands as **North Face, Vans, and Supreme**.

Source: [https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/veronica-wu-vf-corp/](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/veronica-wu-vf-corp/)

Axios, Business Insider, Yahoo News, and other liberal rags pulled off a hit job and the conservatives were silent. They just let it happen and didn't complain. You could hear a pin drop. And the result is that all of these so called ""news organizations"" are allowed to participate in career assassination with impunity. And companies like VF Corporation and Capgemini are co-conspirators and allowed to push the left's agenda without any response from the right.

But as the Bob Dylan song goes, ""The times they are changin'."" The Black Lives Matter organization has been exposed for the fraud that it is, but that's not enough. Instead of punishing people like Veronica Wu for sharing the truth, we should reward them.

Instead of being canceled by angry racists, their voices should amplified.

We should take the time to bring this injustice in the light of day. Everyone should know what VF Corporation and Capgemini did to Veronica. And that the liberals in San Francisco continue to punish Veronica Wu to this day -- banning her from events the minute they read that she questioned the conventional wisdom regarding the fraud ridden organization Black Lives Matter.

Conservative CEOs should seek out people like Veronica Wu and other who has stand up against the real racism in America. Instead of turning our backs on those willing to voice the truth we should embrace them.

Asian Americans usually have higher incomes and more education than almost every other group. The vast majority are legal immigrants or were born in the US. They are really big on hard-work, meritocracy, education, and family values. Moreover, it always seems like the Democrats consistently turn a blind eye to their issues in favour of other minorities. For example, affirmative action.

So then why did more than 70% of them vote for Obama/Hillary? 

Where I'm from, the right-wing parties have no problem attracting votes from ethnic minorities.

"2012-09-06",1346919538,"Bill Clinton: Obama is showing America the path to a modern economy. ","That was so funny I forgot it wasnt a joke! How does verbally minimizing the accomplishments of the private sector handcuffing businesses with excessive regulations while creating the largest pool of welfare recipients this country has ever known - aid in forging a vibrant economy? How does adding a record 5.5 trillion in debt in a mere four years - devaluing the dollar, the purchasing power of businesses and consumers - help create jobs, more disposable income, in a rising sea of inflation? Why is it, AGAIN, Democrats refused to agree to a balanced budge amendment, instead opting to raise the debt ceiling in lieu of slashing wasteful programs? Did America not just lose its AAA credit rating for the first time ever? Surely, the greatest industrial power the world has ever known did not just log a month with zero economic growth; the first time since the Great Depression? And after 41 straight months of unemployment above 8% - another Obama original - not to mention a record number of home foreclosures, is that floaties I see on the flailing arms of Middle America? Yes, Im starting to sense our mystical travel guide is lost!

If the truth be known, our government is bankrupt - printing money to cover its socialist projects, to prop-up our over-speculated markets - and yet Barack Obama still hasnt added one ""net"" job during his lavish spending spree; actually, hes lost over two million. Will someone please explain to me, in the deep recesses of time and space, the fabled tenets of logic itself, the wholesome auspices of peanut butter and jam, how any of those facts translate into a coherent and effective economic policy? Once again, after the medias thorough and exhaustive investigation in 2008, what was Mr. Husseins vast body of executive experience before being elected? Oh, thats right, community organizer: not convenience store manager, Walmart checker, lemonade stand entrepreneur&just community organizer! Yeah, Barry wishes he had worked at Bain Capital! Too bad they cancelled their Marxist, affirmative action, propaganda program. Too much red tape! At least now Nancy Pelosi will have time to read the health care bill!

Sorry, Mr. Clinton, because liberalism is a mental disorder, neither prescribed nor protected under the Constitution, your ridiculous claim is denied! After all, wasn't it your Fair Housing Act -which you promised wouldn't cost taxpayers one cent - that paved the way for the credit collapse in the first place? Barack Obama doesnt know a damn thing about economics, the free enterprise system, and you know it! In fact, he despises it! We the People those patriotic Americans who built and own this country  are tired of picking up the pieces of failed progressive policies. Therefore, on November 6th, 2012, were foreclosing the White House and restoring integrity and fiscal responsibility to government! If this election is really about truth and dignity - not scaring seniors with Medicare or blackmailing minorities with welfare  why did you tell Ted Kennedy in 2008 that Obama would be carrying your bags just a few years earlier? Apparently, touting the party line is getting heavier and heavier.
