"2018-07-04",1530714672,"Even on 4th of July,Trump tweeted total falsehood and misstatements. He's also trying to tear apart the 13th,14th and 15th Amendments to the constitution by hiring a Republican judge in the S.C.O.T.U.S.who'll take away all the rights of the minorities,gay rights and the rights of women to choose.","Trump, who never studied our constitution and has no intention of looking at the Bill of Rights or the 27 ratified Amendments or the synopsis of 6 unratified Amendments to the Constitution, is challenging the intelligence of the broader sections of the country on a daily basis. 

If he had ever realized how the intelligent people like us on the left think about his unwillingness to parse the truth from falsehood that he does so willfully, he could refrain from sending tweets with total disregard of our vast knowledge.

And as per an article by Julie Hirschfeld Davis in NYT today saying,""In a Fox-Inspired Tweetstorm, Trump Offers a Medley of Falsehoods and Misstatements"", she literally spelled out all the lies and braggadocio of our illegitimate president in tweets after tweets with horrendously misspelled words. 

It should be noted here that the foreign policy ideas in all the false tweets that he sent to his millions of supporters came from the hosts of Fox Tv. who're actually deciding our foreign policy since most of the earlier real diplomats are missing in the State Dept. due to Trump's cost cutting misadventures.

Trump, who watches Fox Tv. every morning for eight hours in his pajamas, tweets and retweets with his ""small"" hands as per Marco Rubio, anything he hears on the Morning show without using his own judgement which is nil to begin with.

And as per another editorial in today's NYT called, ""America Started Over Once. Can We Do It Again ?"", the editors in the paper literally trashed Trump's latest executive action doing away with the Affirmative actions in school and college admissions. 

The ""Fourteenth Amendment"" that they highlighted in the same editorial, is an epitome of our constitution which corrected the flaws in our Bill of Rights which was ""a deeply self-contradictory document"" because the slave owning founders never talked about freedom for the slaves which they themselves owned by the thousands.

Although they talked a lot about ""human equality as supreme and a fundamental premise of their new nation"" but they never wanted to give the status of citizenship to the millions of slaves they and their White citizens owned as the same editors mentioned in their piece.

But now as Trump trying to topple the 13th,14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution on its face by rejecting the Affirmative Action in the admission process in our schools and colleges that Justice Kennedy fought so hard to maintain all by his own efforts beside maintaining Gay Rights. 

As we recall that in 1992 Mr. Kennedy also maintained the rights of women to choose abortion or life that the earlier Supreme Court legalized in 1973 under Roe v. Wade.

So Trump's desire to do away with everything that this country achieved in more than 300 years of its independence, is totally criminal in nature, for which he should be prosecuted by the congress and the current Supreme Court with eight Justices since Justice Kennedy already submitted his letter of resignation to Trump.

"2021-07-19",1626683749,"(Not So Brief) Recap/Primer on the High-Stakes Fight in Texas. Why Abbott Axed Staff Salaries, and An Appeal For Help","**(not so brief) Primer on TX SB7/SB1)**

For those unaware or only partially in the know about whats happening in Texas, the GOP has unified control of the State government, which theyre using to try to pass the most nakedly political, implicitly racist, and 1950s-esque restrictive voting rights bill called the Election Integrity and Security Act. Theyve been working on it since March, recently reformed and reconciled it, so that its ready for Floor Action in the House& the final step before it goes to Gov. Abbotts desk. 

Democrats cant filibuster it, except by denying the House a quorum, or total number of electors necessary, to proceed. The governor threatened to have them detained by the Rangers and forced into the House. So, they fled the State en masse to prevent this bill from passing, unable/unwilling to return until the GOP drops this awful bill. 

So why is it so awful that House members are willing to leave their jobs and loved ones for potentially months? Here are five reason why&

**1. Sunday Early Voting would now be limited to only 1pm-9pm** 

If that seems innocuous, at first, Let me explain how its some explicitly racist BS meant to decrease minority turnout. Church is big in Texas, whether youre white or black, but in many black communities the church often also serves as a focal point for the community (Im white, so if Im wrong, please lmk& but it doesnt affect this next part). Theres an operation in Texas, and all over the South, called Souls to the Polls, where following services, buses would  take the congregation straight to an early polling site. Church services DO NOT end at 1pm. They end much earlier. Its one of the most effective means of driving black voter turnout, and the RNC intentionally and capriciously wants to end it with this unjustifiable change thats a Prima Facie example of 21st century racism. 

 **NOTE** this language goes back to SB7, which was overwhelmingly supported but faced a media backlash and is tenuously constitutional. The most recent version to be voted on, SB7, has excluded this particular language (except granting the county election clerk of &lt;30k counties flexibility in setting hours if there isnt a signed petition). 

HOWEVER, the GOP doesnt roll over that easily, this bill would still change the definition of early voting place to mean an office regularly maintained for conducting general clerical functions of the county clerk, and would disallow parties from requesting temporary polling sites; giving the counties total discretion over their location. If the county is GOP controlled, you bet those sites will be far away from the nearest church. 

**2) BANS DRIVE-THRU VOTING**

Unlike #1 this language survives in SB1. A polling site MAY NOT be located in a tent or any temporary site. If you want to vote from your car, you must a) be alone and b) have a valid medical reason to do so. 

Drive-thru voting was overwhelmingly used by democratic voters in 2020. Especially in cities. Thats why the GOP fought tooth and nail to get the court to grant an injunction against their use in Harris County.

Just another way of making voting more difficult. 

**3) public officials CANNOT send unsolicited vote-by-mail applications**

The early voting clerk may make no attempt to solicit a person to complete an application
for an early voting ballot by mail, whether directly or through a third party. This is a trend in red states. In 2020, the majority of States, and several counties in Texas, proactively sent vote-by-mail applications. Well, as you can guess, Texas wasnt happy with the whopping 973,000 ballots (out of like 13m) they received by mail. They dont release party ID numbers, but you can guess which way these ballots leaned (there wouldve been even more if Harris Countys conservative election judge hadnt shot down the countys plan to do so). Now, no county can send out ballots proactively, not even to those over 65 (GOPs loss if passed as is). 

So, an applicant must submit an application, signing it with **ink on paper**, and stating his/her grounds for needing to vote by mail. They would make that more difficult too. In the past, youd merely state something like compromised immune system or risk of illness from polling site. This bill would require either the name of your hospital or the affirmation of a witness of the 2nd degree (so not your mom). As well, in the space right before your signature you must write I certify that the information given in this application is true, and I understand that giving false information in this application is a crime."" 

Their goal is obviously to limit vote by mail as much as possible. *Interestingly*, the new text does allow for a political party or a candidate for voting office [to] distribute an application form for an early ballot to a person who did not request an application. Perhaps theyre worried about 1A claims, or more cynically, this would allow the GOP to reach those 65+ voters who are certainly eligible. 

In a Trumpian nod to the Big Lie, there is a ton of new language about the illegality of vote harvesting. If a party or pac pays you to collect early vote ballots from nursing homes, youd now be committing a felony, as well as open yourself up to civil liability- meaning the opposing party could sue you for damages. We all know how rampant this was in 2020, with Soros funded Dem agents pressuring or even just filling out old peoples ballots, thank gd for this much needed language /s. 

Lastly, all vote-by-mail ballots would be subject to diligent signature verification. The envelope signature needs to match the ballot signature which needs to match your application signature and the drivers license copy you submitted. Something tells me Johnny Flynn III will have a whole lot easier time than Marshawn Brown getting through this ridiculous verification process. Which is to say, its another example of racism and voter suppression. 

**4) Protects The Rights and Repeals Restrictions on Poll Watchers/Observers**

This isnt talked about enough. Theres no test or certificate program one needs to do to become a poll watcher. Theyre merely appointed by their party. And as we saw in 2020, in the case of Trumps Observers and Watchers, you couldnt find a dumber, ruder, more self-entitled group of schmucks if you visited Disneyland on Senior Skip day. 

In the past, election officers had the upper hand when it came to these people. *Reasonable* access was enough, so they couldnt crowd you while youre counting and they could dismiss you if you were out of hand. Youd think after the harassment these vote counters were subjected to in 2020, wed be strengthening laws protecting them. 

This bill would go the other way. It would make it a Class A misdemeanor for an election official refuses full access to a watcher. *Reasonable* would be stricken, and watchers would be guaranteed free movement and stand near enough to see and hear the election officials conducting their official activities. The watcher must be given access to watch the vote tallies be transferred to the data storage device, and then are free to follow the election materials from the regional to the central location or wherever final tabulation occurs. If an election official tries to create distance b/w the watcher and the vote tabulation, they would possibly be committing another offense. 

But dont worry, the watcher takes an oath not to harass anyone /s. 

**5) Attempts to Limit Checks and Balances**

A public official may not create, alter, modify, waive, or suspend any election standard, practice, or procedure mandated by law or rule in a manner not expressly authorized by this code.

Gd forbid something like covid happens again& say, like, a county-wide blackout caused by the failing, aging energy system that Abbott and the Legislature **should** be dealing with rather than this BS& the GOP doesnt want Democratic friendly district and county judges imposing voter friendly rules like they did in some places in 2020. 

####

**Gov Abbott Dialed up the Pressure By Vetoing Salaries for All Legislature Members and Their Staffs. Beginning SEPTEMBER 1st, No More Paychecks For Anyone 

This is some  [Bat Shit Crazy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/18/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats/amp/)[bat shit crazy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/18/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats/amp/) stuff. Facially, it seems like a pretty evident abuse of power, with the Executive Branch impinging on the rights and duties of the Legislature. But idk Texas law, and should it survive, and should the stalemate continue, the consequences of this are potentially dire.  

The special legislative session ends August 6, but that date is meaningless, as Abbott has virtually unlimited power to keep calling 30 day special sessions. Hes hinted his intent to do so, leaving Texas Dems effectively homeless. For the most part, theyve been in DC- agitating for the Federal government to pass the For the People Voting Act, which would block most of what Texas hopes to achieve (Congress would have to end the filibuster to do so, and they dont have the support to do so =-[ ). The stakes are high, the Texas Dems are being cheered on, Abbott shows no sign of backing down. This thing could drag out for awhile. 

When we hit 09/01/21- house and senate electors will stop being paid their $7,200 yearly salaries, with only GOP and present Dem members receiving their $220 per diem when in session. Some of these guys are independently rich, others have second jobs, which hopefully many of them can do remotely (but they tend to be lawyers so, not sure). 

Its not really the electors Im worried about& its the 2,000+ staffers on both side of the aisle. 

The median salary for a House Staffer is $36,000, the lowest paid make just $1,200. Median for the Senate is $44,661, with the lowest paid at $4,160. And these being medians, I imagine young, newer aides make half that. [Source](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/How-much-do-Texas-legislators-make-A-look-at-16222302.php)

Abbott is literally trying to starve them out. House members will be fine; Im sure they can obtain a personal loan from a DNC backer or find a way to treat personal expenditures as politically related. But they care about their staff and the best theyd be able to do for em is lay them off so they can apply for Texas crappy unemployment. 

Thank you to those who have read my post up to this point. I know I wasnt brief but I hope I laid out the stakes, the courage of these 51 Texas Dems, and a potentially looming pitfall in their strategy. I am not even that strong democrat, but anyone who has read the original or updated bill (and either could still pass, technically) can tell its an attack on America. What the GOPs proposing is downright evil. Its basically the legislative equivalent of gerrymandering. Both the GOP state and National party recognize the shifting demographics that could turn Texas blue in 4-8 years, and they are committed to ensuring that cant happen with this restrictive voting bill. Its a slap in the face to the Democratic Texas party apparatus that has worked so hard over the last decade, and more importantly, its a slap in the face to democracy. 

How can you help? Im not sure. Ive never done something like this before, myself. What I hope to do, ideally, is take Abbotts salary slasher chess piece off the table. Prevent his tactic by organizing some sort of a gofundme or something thru actblue that would take up a collection to serve as a backstop for those Texas Democratic house/senate staff who lose their salaries on September 1st, and could really use the help. 

If you have any experience, or any ideas, or just want to help& please reach out. And keep spreading the word about Texas. This is democracys Alamo.","democrats",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/on9zbv/not_so_brief_recapprimer_on_the_highstakes_fight/"

"2015-10-15",1444921236,"Who won the debate? Be specific and cite your sources.","I'm getting very tired of this back and forth about who won the debate. Publications are saying Clinton without a doubt, online polls are saying Sanders, and no one is mentioning O'Malley unless they mention his looks. There has to be a more objective way to really understand who won.

Things to consider in terms of judging are:

* Quality of answers in terms of details

* Delivery versus incoherence

* ""Being Presidential""

* Exceeding expectations

* Excitement

* Policy positions

With all this, in mind, I will give my opinion.

I, a definite Hillary supporter, actually thought after the debate was over the winner of the debate was O'Malley. He had the strongest opening and closing statements. He was perfectly progressive and spoke well about his past experiences. His one fault was that he didn't provide the best vision of what an O'Malley administration would be doing but I think that's why he's clamoring for so many more debates. This was his first real time to get in front of America and in doing so, he showed Presidential chops. To me, he far exceeded the performance that his polling numbers would have you expect.

In second place, I think Hillary came a very close second to O'Malley. She had the benefit of more speaking time and with it did great. She showed her intelligence and experience which I think we all expected. What I didn't expect was how well she handled her attacks. At various points, the focus was on her whether it was her hawkish foreign policy or her Wall Street ties and I think she defended them beautifully. She didn't shirk from it, explained her reasoning behind her positions, and ultimately stood her ground. This might not have convinced you to vote for her but it showed some serious Presidential cojones which I was glad to see. She certainly could've done even better considering everyone knew she was going to be attacked at some point but still she did well. She slightly exceeded the expectation I had for her, even as a supporter.

Sanders to me came in third. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't bad; he just wasn't amazing. His performance was exactly what I expected from him. Most of his answers centered around Wall Street greed, business-government ties, and education which is what he always says. However, he even answered in these ways in some foreign policy questions and what not. It just seemed like he was oversimplifying the role of the President. I also think he absolutely, 100% stumbled on the gun question. He knew it was going to be brought up and he was unable to defend it clearly. Does he support gun control or does he not because he's from a rural state? Even O'Malley came at him and mentioned that Maryland is rural too and he was able to pass legislation. This was one of the moments where I saw ""Bernie the *politician*"" come out versus ""Bernie the people's man."" I was waiting for Bernie to blow me away and quite frankly, he didn't even one bit. One thing I will give him a lot of credit for, as a non-Democrat (he's independent after all) he seems to want to heal the party more than I'd ever expect. 

Chaffee was fourth. The guy was just too rehearsed. He wasn't necessarily bad in his answers, with the exception of why he voted yes on Glass-Steagall (it was your first day?), but they all sounded like an automated answering machine. I never thought I'd see the perfect personification of stale bread on a televised debate.

Jim Webb. Oh, man, my heart goes out to you. You seem like a good guy but you are just a tad lost. Worst yet, you couldn't even defend how it is that you got to where you are. That ""biggest enemy"" answer was chilling. I felt I was filling in answers for you. Affirmative action? I got what you were saying (not that I necessarily 100% agree) but why do I have to feel like I'm in the spin room instead of just watching as a concerned citizen? 

Last but not least, Joe Biden. It's like you weren't even there!!

Anyways, I know this might be a bit long and I have a feeling I know what most people's answers are going to be. However, I'm more curious about how you got to your opinion and why. I don't care much for answers like ""Sanders was just a cranky man. Not Presidential AT ALL"" nor do I want to see any ""Hillary: why da fuck you lyin? Why you always lying?"" 

Come with substance. Come with the political insights I expect you all to have. Come with quotes from the debate itself.

Back in 2008, I was only 17, and clearly unable to vote in the elections, but I supported Obama because he was pro-gay (a direct issue for my personal liberty), he wanted healthcare for all Americans, and he promised to end the wars and shut down Guantanamo (something that I had found horrifying to exist).

Anyways, after he assassinated American citizen without due process, his failure to close Guantanamo, and now his efforts to stay in Afghanistan for another 2years, I don't feel as enthusiastic as I did four years ago. In fact the only reason I would vote for him, is because I wouldn't want Romney to win (who has a terrible time relating to the non-wealthy), I wouldn't want Santorum to win (clearly, an idiot), and I don't want Gingrich to win (I'm not a homophobic, racist southerner)... in fact I voted Ron Paul in the primaries simply because he was the most liberal candidate I found (other than his weird economic policies, but I compromised those feelings with the basis that congress would never allow that to be passed in a budget or law).

I'm almost compelled not to take part in voting for either of the two parties. I feel that none of the candidates are actually liberal (and this goes beyond just LGBT/Women/Minority causes, this extends to war &amp; civic individualism)... which was my prime reason for supporting Obama in any way I could in 08. Any advise or claims that will stir up my support for him again?

**EDIT**

Since Ron Paul apparently has such a huge pop-culture vibe. I'm NOT a supporter of Ron Paul-- nor would I ever vote for him as president, I voted for him in the primaries. I just agree with his civic values on individual liberty, and his foreign policy. NOT AT ALL his immigration/abortion/affirmative action/economic/etc. views. I'm about as liberal as they come.","democrats",51,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/r43hu/maybe_someone_can_help_me_support_obama_again/"

"2012-04-05",1333604540,"In honor of MLK, some thoughts about Obama's 
""middle class"" and the ""evil"" of the Right","Obama is deploying a rather interesting figure: the idea of ""social Darwinism"", which is a pretty hefty concept with some rather interesitng implications. ""Fish"" decal on cars, anyone? I guess the question that is percolating for me here is: what does the idea of the ""middle class"", the centerpiece of Obama's platform, mean? How does this relate to the poor? How does it relate to criticisms of Obama vis a vis the disappoint that many have regarding his, shall we say, ""vocation"" and historical uniqueness regarding race? 

It's of course one of the more remarkably racist things that anyone even remotely touched by ""black genes"" is ""black"", plain and simple. Hitler would agree. Is anyone touched by poverty poor? In any case, the race issue is timely becuase this is the anniversary of the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was, at that time, on the verge of launching a poor people's march. 

Enter Obama, years later, a ""black man"", who has had a hard time living up to the traumatic history by which his election was made possible. Today he has tried to throw down the gauntlet, in the form of the charge of ""social Darwinism"" against the Republicans, which would seem to be to the good. This emphasis on the middle class stands in some kind of contrast to Dr. King's emphasis on the poor, at a time when the Occupy movement is standing for, well, interestingly enough, not the poor as such alone, but the 99 percent. The empahsis on these two, the middle class and the 99 percent seem in a strange way to avoid a clear focus on the plight of the poor, plain and simple.

Of course this is all couched in rhetoric of ""class warfare"" by the Right. Obama's emphasis on the middle class, then, appears to be of a piece with his strateg (if that is what it is) of compromise. A compromised Dr. King, perhaps. And some noble efforts on Obama's part, notably the heath care law, the emphasis for which has been placed on a sense of a system that ""doesn't work"", rather than a system that is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. 

Which is to say that Obama's stance is compromised, maybe through and through. Add to this that he's viewed the Republican platform as a ""Trojan horse"". That is to say, a deception. 

Now, how would one characterize, in its essence, such a deception, coupled with the charge of social Darwinism? It is *evil*. This is the operating concept for Obama as regards ""peace"", as evidenced by his Nobel Peace prize speech, in which he cast Gandhi and MLK as ""idealists"", ""but there is evil in the world"". Thus, from a certian middle and space of compromise, Obama throws down this gauntlet: the Right is ""evil"". 

Evil. Dr. King's movement was founded, ostensibly, on the idea of love, in that heart on the sleeve idealism and religious, actually, engagement that was out to stand in the face of something like ""evil"" with this strange strategy that was uniquely uncompromising, the *satyagraha* or ""holding to truth"" in love in the face of brutal oppression. King's importation of Gandhi's strategy brought it quite fully into the auspices of his Christian commitment, which is Obama's commitment as well. It was not, interestingly enoiugh, Gandhi's primary commitment. Gandhiji's commitment was, first and foremost, a double commitment to truth and nonviolence, *regardless of religious doctrine*. 

Obama seeks to moblize thought and action by activating the fundamentalism to which he is committed, a war, as it were, against ""Gog and Magog"", to quote George Bush, Jr. A war against evil. From the safety of the moderate emphasis on the middle class and the middling view of health care, he is striking out against conservatism by imputing it as being, simply put, evil.

This is a time of horrific and bloody violence in the Middle East and elsewhere, and also a time of a strange, resplendent and courageous event of the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, grounded predominantly in nonviolence. 

The problem is that this nonviolence is antithetical to the concept of evil. The concept of evil in this operative sense is a mobilization for war: the mobilizatin of thought into the casting of ones opponent as being utterly devoted to causing harm. There is no question that conservatives today can indeed by quite harmful. Yet, so can liberals in something that has not yet dawned on them: that their own eschewing of the trenches of battle in favor of compromise and a certain ""middle way"" might not, itself, still fail to attain an adequate grounding and understanding. In so doing, the Left has overseen some of the more violent activities in recent years, notably the sanctions on Iraq in recent years, which, while being supposedly diplomatic, killed more than any other action undertaken in the last two decades. In these actions, deadlier than the wars in Iraq and Afghanisan combined, the deaths of 500,000 children was deemed ""worth the price"" by the Clinton administration. And in recent weeks, Obama has threatened ""diplomatic"", ""crippling sanction"" on Iran, which amounts to threatening to bring about the deaths through intentional action of potentially have a million children. 

What is going on here? Obama remains ensconced in a religious commitment whose genealogy and provenance traces right into the heart of Dr. King's religious commitment, which radically differed from Gandhi's in that it subordinates thought to religious faith. His efforts to raise the ante, to raise the stakes, to get busy or serious, are going to come out of a basis that is above all cemented in a faith commitment whose program is lodged in a conceptuality rooted in a logic of ""good versus evil"" in an all too simple and retrograde form, a form which, furthermore, has a particular program and principle of the aim of a certian dominance. In this commitment, thought can not be free and nonviolence is not adequately developed. But this was also the case for Dr. King, whose basic commitments have forged and anchored in a most unfortunate way the progress he sought, crippling it egregiously, despite some rather good intentions. 

It appears that Obama must step out from under the umbrella and safety of his religious commitment to think honestly and freely and deal with morality in a less prescribed form and rather in a more original condition of nonviolence and nonharm. Only by doing this and by decentering or deconstructing his conception of ""evil"" can he more positively and directly illuminate and vaunt the true causes that are on his true path: mortality in the issue of health care and poverty in the issue of the well being of the nation. Any attempt simply to take the conservatives as evil will fail and render Obama's efforts impotent and potentially more dangerous as well. 

And this imputation of evil will galvanize the Right and give them to affirm, in their own way, their commitment to the poor which, oddly enough, in the end, may be a bit better than Obama is going to be able to recognize. Santorum's commitment, for example, will exceed this conception of social Darwinism in the very same way that the hawks' commitment to democratization exceeded the charges of ""imperialsm"" on the part of the Left, which enabled the wars. 

And, again, at the same time, the mere avoidance of war withoiut a true commitment to free thought and nonviolence has spelled failure in a number of ways for the Left, prefiguring and enabling the brutal sanctions, but just as importantly, disabling the true support for the only real hope for the Middle East: nonviolence-based revolution.

It is that nonviolence-based revolution that Obama needs to be considering more fully at home, albeit in that form of ""revolution"" that is possible from the position of the presidency. As long as he is rooted in this conception of ""evil"", coupled with an absolute commitment of faith as program, he will systematically disable the progress that is most deeply needed for the poor and those in truly mortal peril. 

This may seem a bit general, but such generality is needed, I believe, provided that it can keep a clear head about these basic principles I have set forth here. This is the lay of the land. These issues, I believe, are what must be dealt with in order to effectuate real change.","democrats",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ru99x/in_honor_of_mlk_some_thoughts_about_obamas_middle/"
"2019-11-04",1572907577,"Key Elections to Watch this Tuesday","Please remember to vote! Below are key elections to watch on Tuesday, but this is by no means a comprehensive list, so be sure to [**find your polling place**](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/) and [read up on what you'll be voting on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_elections).

### Gubernatorial Elections

* [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Kentucky_gubernatorial_election): One-term Republican Matt Bevin is seeking re-election. In the May 21 primaries, Bevin held off three opponents to win the Republican primary. He will face Attorney General Andy Beshear, who defeated two challengers in the Democratic primary. The latest poll from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy has the two candidates in a dead heat.
* [Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mississippi_gubernatorial_election): Faced with an open seat due to current Gov. Phil Bryants term limits, Democrats could potentially stage an upset in this historically Republican state. While Mississippi hasnt elected a Democrat to the role since 1999, the two state officials competing for the seat  Attorney General Jim Hood (D) and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R)  are within striking distance of one another. 

### Legislative Elections

* [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly): Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.
* Legislative elections will be held for both houses of the [Louisiana Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Legislature), the [Mississippi Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Legislature), and the lower house of the [New Jersey Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature).  

### Mayoral Elections

* [San Francisco, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_San_Francisco_mayoral_election): London Breed, the first African American woman the city has elected for mayor, is now running for a full term.
* [South Bend, IN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_Bend,_Indiana_mayoral_election): Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg wont be running for reelection but hes endorsed his former chief of staff James Mueller. Mueller is the favorite in a race against public school teacher and Republican candidate Sean Haas.
* [Philadelphia, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Philadelphia_mayoral_election): Kenney is running on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, maintain supervised injection sites and the city's soda tax, and ensure the city's compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Ciancaglini promises to end Philadelphia's status as a sanctuary city and to cancel plans to establish sites where people can legally inject heroin. No Republican has won a Philadelphia mayoral election since Bernard Samuel in 1947

### Ballot Measures

* [Washington State](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_elections,_2019): The use of affirmative action in Washington state as it relates to government jobs and state universities has been barred since 1998, when voters approved a measure banning it. This year, voters will have the option to reinstate affirmative action.
* [New York City, NY](https://ballotpedia.org/City_elections_in_New_York,_New_York_(2019)): A ballot initiative asks voters whether theyd like to use ranked-choice voting in races such as the mayors election and the city council race. If the initiative passes, it would bring ranked-choice voting to the most populous city in the country, a huge step for pro-ranked-choice reform efforts.
