"2020-02-25",1582604907,"'Education deserts' are a serious problem, and for-profit colleges are taking advantage","Its one thing to not be able to afford a college education. Its an entirely different issue altogether when you dont even have a college around you.

A recent report from Jain Family Institute (JFI) reveals that access to college isnt just about the cost of college. Physical access to public higher education institutions across America has also been highly unequal. 

Specifically, as detailed by JFIs interactive map, regions in Americas West have little-to-no access to an institution of higher education, compared to the East Coast.


One of the major takeaways when you're looking at the map is the staggering amount of populated areas that are considered highly concentrated, Laura Beamer, higher education finance project lead at JFI and one of the two authors of the study, told Yahoo Finance. We figured out that roughly 2.4 million prospective students have access to most one public option nearby & Though financial access is extremely important, geographic access is also a very important piece of this dialogue and should be talked about more.


The Rocky Mountain region is the worst off, the report added, followed closely by the Plains region. 

The JFI report  which drew on various points of data from the 2016-17 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, enrollment data from 2017, the 2016 5-year population, and median income estimates from the American Community Survey, driving durations to higher ed institutions in the area, zip codes, and more  created a School Concentration Index which measures the variation across the higher education market across different types of schools in the U.S. and U.S. territories. 

Four states  Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming  were found to have higher education institution monopolies or close to it, meaning that there is only one institution or very few schools to choose from.



Prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions

The authors found that a highly concentrated zip code (in red) means that there are few  or in some cases zero  higher education institutions in the area. A low concentration implies that there are a wide variety of options available for prospective students.

In the U.S., 38% of the population lives in highly concentrated zip codes, where they have access to very few or no higher education institutions, according to Beamer and her co-author Marshall Steinbaum, who is also an assistant professor of economics at the University of Utah. If a student from these areas wanted to attend a college or university, their commute would be at least 45 minutes.

The unequal access has wide-ranging implications for prospective students, most of them negative.

Parts of the U.S. where theres little to no access to a higher ed institution are prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions, just as they are known to draw disproportionately from populations historically excluded from traditional higher ed on the basis of race and class, the authors argued.

The for-profit higher education sector saw tremendous growth since the financial crisis. In 2016, the New York Fed noted that enrollment at these schools had skyrocketed as the country emerged out of the Great Recession. For-profit colleges have also been known to saddle graduates with high levels of student debt, and in some cases, provide low-quality education with false promises of job placement.

The Obama administrations crackdown on for-profit colleges led to several closures, and recent action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pushed the University of Phoenix to put a stop to deceptive advertising of lucrative job opportunities.

Despite government action, for-profits persist due to these gaps in availability.



A school could ... possibly practice price discrimination

So why are schools so unequally distributed across the U.S. in the first place? 

It comes down to the structure that that states have put in place and just haven't been able to update over the last few decades, Beamer said. There is a rural versus urban dynamic as well & schools are going to open in places where there's a labor market and where there's a large population of students. 

The biggest problem arising is a neglect of the West, the researchers argue, where a school could determine prices and access unilaterally and possibly practice price discrimination.

More broadly, the issues raises a more philosophical question about what higher education represents.

We have this idea that higher education as a societal institution is egalitarian & there's also a lot of reasons why it isn't, said Steinbaum. This is one tiny piece of evidence among a broad painting of the fact that the higher education system is extremely stratified.

They're screwed on the front end as well as the other end

Another problem of education deserts trickles down below higher education.

Folks in these certain geographic areas which more often tend to be rural, have fewer options, Ryan Wells, associate professor of higher education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Yahoo Finance.

Rural students not only had fewer options for college, he explained, but they also had fewer resources to prepare them for college in the first place when compared to their suburban or urban counterparts.

It's kind of like   to put it crassly  they're screwed on the front end with what they have with their preparation and their resources and things to be ready for college, Wells said, and then fewer options on the other end as well.


Responsible colleges offer a way out

Fortunately, there are some good actors that restore faith in the system.

The University of Wyoming  despite having monopoly status  takes its job to offer accessible higher education seriously. 

We are quite a blue-collar state, University of Wyoming spokesperson Chad Baldwin told Yahoo Finance. Only about 24% of our adults have a bachelor's degree or higher [so] one of our goals is to try to lift the educational attainment level.

Baldwin noted that the university has a broad open admissions standard: Our acceptance rate is something in the order of 97%. Furthermore, according to Baldwin, more than half of the universitys graduates who started as first-time students didnt graduate with any student loan debt, thanks to low tuition and fees, and a state scholarship program.

The tuition for a Wyoming resident undergraduate for a year is about $6,300, he added.

Factoring in living costs and so on, that comes up to about $13,000 per year, based on data from the Department of Educations College Scorecard

"2020-02-08",1581201509,"Appeals court holds university liable for ineffective Title IX policies","A federal court opinion could put the policies and procedures of colleges and universities in California and the western U.S. under a microscope for their ability to prevent sexual assault.

An institution can be held liable for pre-assault claims, which allege that its policies for enforcing Title IX are inadequate, create an environment of heightened risk of sexual misconduct and lead a complainant to be harassed or assaulted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared in a ruling Thursday. The federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex at institutions that receive federal funding and requires them to investigate reports of sexual misconduct 

Three former students who allege they were assaulted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 initially brought a case against the University of California systems Board of Regents in 2015 for Berkeley's handling of their individual complaints. When the case was dismissed in district court, the women appealed.

While many of the recent federal court decisions on Title IX have focused on the rights of respondents, the Ninth Circuit opinion is a big win for victims advocates, especially if other appeals courts follow suit, said Peter Lake, director of the Law Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.

The ruling by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circult referenced a 2014 California State Auditor report of Berkeleys processes under Title IX. The report found that from 2009 to 2013, Berkeley did not notify or give regular updates to parties involved in investigations of sexual misconduct, did not complete investigations in a timely manner and did not sufficiently educate staff and students on sexual misconduct prevention, which led cases to be mishandled and compromised student safety, according to the Ninth Circuit opinion.

Berkeleys use of an early resolution process that addressed complaints of sexual assault without formal investigations also came under fire in the courts opinion. It is standard for institutions to pursue early resolution or mediation between the complainant and respondent only in cases of sexual harassment and when both parties are in agreement, said Jake Sapp, deputy Title IX coordinator and compliance officer at Austin College, in Texas.

The former Berkeley students asserted that only two of the 500 cases of sexual misconduct reported to the university in 2012 were resolved in a formal process and that they were coerced into early resolution by the university. This was allegedly done so Berkeley did not have to report assaults under the Clery Act, which requires institutions to disclose crimes on their campuses, according to the students lawsuit.

Berkeley was ordered by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to revise its Title IX policies after a 2014 investigation by the agency. The university subsequently enacted many new policies, procedures and services over the last few years, according to a February 2018 statement from the university.

But the opinion could open other colleges and universities in the California system and elsewhere in the states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- to lawsuits that challenge the effectiveness of their Title IX policies, Lake said.

Contrary to other federal court opinions that address an institutions deliberate indifference to or inaction on a report of sexual misconduct after the fact, the Ninth Circuits opinion discusses what is known as before theory, Lake said.

If your state system does some analysis and finds inadequacies in terms of response, thats something that they will take more seriously, Lake said. This is a different kind of argument: that the policies themselves shut the door before anyone is able to provide notice.

The door is now open for plaintiffs to argue before theory in the Ninth Circuit. The opinion creates a broader standard than a similar case, Simpson v. University of Colorado, which said that colleges can be liable if there is knowledge of sexual misconduct in a specific program, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators. That case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado.

""It may be easier to establish a causal link between a schools policy of deliberate indifference and the plaintiffs harassment when the heightened risk of harassment exists in a specific program,"" the Ninth Circuit opinion said. ""But we will not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff could adequately allege causation even when a schools policy of deliberate indifference extends to sexual misconduct occurring across campus.""

The Ninth Circuit ruling did note that Title IX does not require California to purge its campus of sexual misconduct to avoid liability and that a university is not responsible for guaranteeing the good behavior of its students.

Sokolow believes most of the higher education institutions in California already hold a high standard for Title IX processes and will be unsurprised by this progressive opinion in the Ninth Circuit. But colleges and universities elsewhere might now look more closely at their admissions policies for special admits or transfer students, such as athletic scholarship recipients, for histories of sexual misconduct.

Its going to not only put individuals in the Ninth Circuit on alert but Title IX administrators across the nation, Sapp said.

Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who represents students accused of sexual assault, said the hope is that colleges do not become overly concerned with pre-assault claims and pursue cases that are not strong enough for investigation and disciplinary measures against accused students.

The hope is that universities will heed this and take measures to ensure that both Title IX complainants and respondents are treated fairly, equitably and given the due process protections that they deserve, Miltenberg wrote in an email.

The case will now return to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide whether to proceed with the claims against the Board of Regents based on the appeals courts new standard.

"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

{snip}

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}

"2020-08-12",1597269737,"We dont waste fellowships on women: Microbiologist Rita Colwell on sexism in academia","Congress had excluded white-collar professionals from the equal pay for equal work provisions of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Three years later, however, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11375 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against women when hiring. Researching the subject, Sandler spotted a footnote. Being an academic, she said, I read footnotes, so I turned to the back of the book to read it. And there, Sandler found a way forward for women like herself: by taking federal funds, the University of Maryland (and all research universities receiving federal funding) had become a federal contractor. It was a genuine Eureka moment, Sandler later wrote. I actually shrieked aloud. 

Working with the Womens Equity Action League, a small Ohio group focusing on economic and legal issues with educational institutions, Sandler filed a class action suit against the University of Maryland and 250 other American colleges and universities. She based many of the cases on evidence of bias in hiring, tenure decisions, promotions, and salaries sent to her by women from all over the country. Although Sandler would win some of these lawsuits, the lack of enforcement powers in Johnsons executive order muted her victories. There were no penalties for the offending universities to pay or procedures put in place to reverse the inequities. Thankfully, the story didnt end there.

Instead, the issue of employment bias moved quietly to Congress, where Representative Edith Green, an Oregon Democrat and former schoolteacher, was passionately interested in womens equality in education. Having accumulated enough seniority to chair a House subcommittee on education, she held hearings on sex discrimination in academia. Then Green made a savvy move: she moved the legislation that would come to be known as Title IX through Congress so stealthily that almost no onenot the men who voted for it nor the educational establishment that would be tasked with carrying it outknew what was happening.

Quietly organizing her forces, Green hired Sandler to coach her staff about gender discrimination in academia, while Vincent Macaluso, a sympathetic federal expert in the Department of Labor, provided secret advice on strategy. Morag Simchak, also from the Department of Labor, drafted an amendment so forbiddingly technical that she knew no one would even attempt to read it. Sandler reported tongue in cheek that Simchak, having informed her superiors once about her work on drafting the amendment, did not feel any great need to inform them again. Several months later, Green, without informing her colleagues in the House of Representatives about the implications of what she was doing, slipped Simchaks short passage banning sex discrimination in any educational program receiving federal aid into what would become the Educational Amendments Act of 1972. Once the passage was in the bill, Green ordered the leaders of womens groups not to lobby for Title IX of the act. She didnt want to alert the men in Congress to its importance. And so, still happily oblivious to what Title IX meant, Congress made it illegal to discriminate against women in education and gave individual women the power to sue universities in order to hold on to their jobs, protest tenure or employment decisions, and demand equal pay.

The university athletic establishment considered the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 a very minor bill, Sandler would later explain. The word sports was not even in it. A month later, Jonathan Spivak of the Wall Street Journal broke the real story under a masterfully understated headline: Sex-Bias Section Could Spark Controversy.

Worried about losing federal funds, university lawyers promptly ordered some quick fixes. Old-style anti-nepotism bans against hiring faculty wives gave way to modern prohibitions against relatives supervising relatives. Almost overnight, a few leading scientists were leapfrogged three steps up the academic ladder, from research associate to professor, including two women mentioned in the previous chapter Violet B. Haas, the brilliant mathematician in Purdues engineering department, and Dora Priaulx Henry, the barnacle expert at the University of Washington  and several accomplished research associates at Harvard. Thousands of women suddenly received big pay raises, often without explanation and generally without back pay. For the first time, educational institutions had to publicly advertise job searches, end gender quotas for admission to graduate and professional schools, and pay equal stipends for male and female graduate students  although white men continued to get prestigious research assistantships while women and other groups underrepresented in science continued to receive less-prestigious teaching assistantships.

Above all, Title IX allowed us to believe change was possible. But those of us who also hoped Title IX would take care of sexism in science were soon dismayed.

Even if she didnt discriminate on the basis of disability, not allowing part of the school population from seeing a school performance, it still sounds illegal because they should be open to ALL the students since her production is funded by taxpayers-she was a school employee and using school property to execute the rehearsals and performances. 
If she had her own production outside of school funded by her own money, then she can deny admission to whoever she wants, but its wrong to do that on a production funded by taxpayers. Legally, she didnt even own any of the productions that she created at school because she was an employee of the school district and since it was created within the scope of her employment, the school district owns the rights to the production aka work-for-hire.
