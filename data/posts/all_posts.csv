"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

Please feel free to send us your thoughts at [email] or on our FB page.

http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/08/jon-stewart-accuses-kathleen-sebelius-of-lying-to-him-about-obamacare/

&gt;I still dont understand why individuals have to sign up and businesses dont, because if the businesses  if shes saying, well, they get a delay because that doesnt matter anyway because they already give health care, then you think to yourself, fuck it, then why do they have to sign up at all, he said. And then I think to myself, well, maybe shes just lying to me.

&gt;During the interview, Stewart said criticism over the seeming double standard was very legitimate.

&gt;But if Im if an individual Im wondering  well, an individual who doesnt want this because there are individuals clearly that want this  but if Im an individual that doesnt want it, it would be hard for me to look at big business getting a waiver and not having to do it and me having to because I would think, geez, it looks like because I dont have a lobbying group, he told Sebelius. I would feel like you are favoring big business because they lobbied you to delay it because they didnt want to do this year but you are not allowing individuals that same courtesy.


And Marco Rubio:

http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57608616/marco-rubio-postponing-obamacare-mandate-a-prudent-approach/

&gt;He called effort to postpone the Obamacare measure a ""prudent approach."" On ""CBS This Morning,"" he said, ""It's unfair to punish people for not purchasing a product that they can't purchase right now because of the technology that's in place, the web site they're supposed to buy it on -- by the president's own admission -- is not working.

&gt;Rubio said he's hopeful the measure will pass, especially as the deadline draws closer. ""As weeks go on, there's going to be a look for a solution to the problem. It's not fair to punish people for buying something that's not available,"" he said. ""Quite frankly, I think that's where we're going to have to wind up anyway. You saw yesterday, the White House didn't rule out a delay. Jay Carney didn't rule it out because they understand that the problems that this web site faces are significant and are going to be very difficult to fix in a number of weeks.""

So is this a rare moment where Progressive/Liberal/Democrats  and Tea Party/Republican/Conservatives agree on something. I hope Mr. Rubio calls Jon and asks to go on the show!

"2011-05-18",1305696563,"The 3 reforms I believe could fix most of our nation's problems."," - State Homes:  Dormitory-style housing where anyone, regardless of income, can find a private, safe place, to sleep, and eat.  Residents will be required to contribute through a special tax on all income (until such a time as the cost of their housing has been repaid, adjusted for inflation) and must provide unpaid service to their building (i.e. security, cooking, cleaning, maintenance, etc.).  Individuals who refuse to contribute will be denied housing.  State Homes can also provide the utility of emergency shelters for the displaced, those escaping domestic violence, the homeless, etc.  These would, in no way, be luxurious -- what I envision would more closely resemble a prison cell (e.g. 7' x 7' rooms) than a condo, and the food would be along the lines of protein bars -- the point would be to provide a safety net which encourages people to improve their condition, without forcing them onto the street.

 - State Schools:  We already provide K-12 education for all, regardless of citizenship.  For those who can prove citizenship, we should extend this structure to include higher education and trade education.  This taxpayer-funded education should not be compulsory and admission should be based on merit.  As opposed to traditional schools which encourage seemingly frivolous educations (e.g. majors with no real market value, ""mickey mouse"" electives, etc.), State schools should focus on skills which are useful to society, and admission to professional programs should be based on projected market demand (i.e. if we expect to need X physicians, only something like 1.25X students should be admitted).  Students who attend a State School, shall be required to pay a special tax on all income, for the entirety of their professional careers.  For certain professions where there is a distinct societal need, but a lack of interest on the part of students, this tax can be waived in full or in part to provide an incentive for students.

 - State Care:  We already provide medicare/medicaid, however these programs are very expensive and do not ensure all citizens have access to necessary medical care.  We can expand medicare to cover all and significantly reduce costs by utilizing State Schools.  Most providers can be hired from the pool of State School graduates.  We can then waive education-tax repayment for those who agree to remain in the employ of the state for X years.  Accordingly, we can pay a fair wage, but a wage which is significantly less than current (2011) prevailing wages for physicians/etc.  With regards to pharmaceuticals and durable medical equipment, we can encourage State Schools to research new drugs/DME, but providing assistance WRT testing.  Drugs/DME discovered could then be licensed out to manufacturers (reducing the cost as they are not doing the research/testing and do not carry such liability) with the school guaranteed a predetermined percentage (I'm thinking around 5%) of the manufacturer's profit.  Manufacturers who go this route can be given a ""profit cap"", whereby they can only mark up the product so much.  After a particular period of time (say 10 years), the drug/DME could then fall into the public domain.  Through this, we can significantly reduce the costs of medical care *while* encouraging innovation.

The homes, schools, and care programs could serve to increase the bargaining power of both American workers and consumers while encouraging competition in private enterprise.  If an individual doesn't have to fear homelessness, they can resign from a particularly abusive employer.  If the cost of higher education isn't so exorbitant, employees can be paid less and still retain a decent standard of living.  Without a captive market, housing prices would drop significantly, further reducing the need for such high salaries in the US, making us more competitive with foreign nations.  Existing industries would need to adapt themselves (e.g. health insurers would need to focus on luxury care, as would private hospitals, etc.), but it doesn't have to put them out of business...unless they refuse to adapt themselves.  And I believe this could also provide a hedge against inflation (i.e. as individuals earn less, and the cost of production drops, consumer prices will drop as well).","politics",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hdzlp/the_3_reforms_i_believe_could_fix_most_of_our/"
"2012-09-09",1347163026,"Lessons from history that all Americans should know","If anyone actually bothers to read this in its entirety, kudos.

Before going to bed, I've been doing a lot of thinking and self research as I find myself becoming more and more amped for the upcoming election.

I think politics can be, and should be interesting, and maybe even fun.  

For all the criticisms and negativity toward government, we should remember we're in quite a new golden age of personal liberties that we, as humans still need to work out the big kinks.

And let the developing world serve as an example of the dark depths of humanity that always have and still exist to this day.

Here's my take on some important things from history, feel free to discuss, call me an idiot, whatever!

One of the common themes we always hear today is the general animosity from the international community toward the United States.  And while it is absolutely true that the U.S. had meddled in some questionable acts such as Manifest Destiny or the ill motives that may be present in more recent wars, we should recall how things got the way they have.

Let me begin with Washington's farewell address, specifically his take on foreign policy.

""It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any part of the foreign world.""

Among many things Washington advised in his Address, this quote interests me.  The founding fathers wanted to stay away from alliances with other powers.  Their problems are theirs, and we have no reason to be involved.

And we, as a nation, generally accepted that through the 19th century.

So how did the U.S. eventually become the hated power that reaches around he world?

We do have to concede that by WW1, the United States already were policing the western hemisphere.  But in general, aside from territorial wars with Mexico and in general preserving our own interests, no large scale conflicts arose.

It is interesting to note hat by our third President, our Commander in Chief was already stretching his powers.  Jefferson himself admitted the Louisiana Purchase was beyond his presidential powers, but pulled the trigger for the good of the nation.

This is important because Presidents have generally been able to stretch their powers in such ways.  They just do it.  But nobody resents Jefferson from doing so, unles you are the Spanish, or the native Americans.

In any case, a significant shift in world power occurred in the late 19th century.  The US and Japan were stronger in power than Europe.  

Remember what Washington said,  about alliances?  An intertwined Europe vaults a small conflict to World War 1.

Let's remind ourselves that, to this point, the U.S. wasnt yet a global power. A strong nation, yes, but not tested.  

WW1 is significant because it forces America's hand into Europe.
But even at the outbreak of war, Woodrow Wilson, congress, and the general public maintained neutrality.

This was until Germany started sinking American vessels in the Atlantic.  I think most people are familiar with the name Lusitania, a vessel sunk by Germany that resulted in the loss of 125 American lives.

After 2 years of no combat, the American PUBLIC was angered and called for war.

If you think about it, auxterior motives aside, it kind of resembles American gen opinion after 9/11.

Congress declares war on Germany in 1917.
Thanks Germany!

At first the U.S. sent supplies, but eventually sent American blood to Europe to end the war.

And that is what happened.  Germany surrenders in 1918.

Woodrow Wilson declared this to be the ""war to end all wars.""

Sadly, we know that was far from reality.

What is important here is that the world looked to the U.S. to deal with the aftermath, a bloody mess courtesy of Europe.

This is significant.  The baby nation, but fast growing America was now dealing with Grandpa Europe.  Imagine your 12 year old brother settling a fight that broke out among the seniors at a family reunion.  It forced the United States to lead the Old World after wanting to remain neutral up to that point.

But fine, let's make some reasonable solutions.  We don't want another war on this scale.

Woodrow Wilson would make a framework for the post WW1 world.

1) his 14 points included a guideline for what the world powers should do.  This included DISARMAMENT, and no secret diplomacies among other things.

2) Wilson creates the League of Nations, a forum where nations could peacefully discuss diplomatic issues.

The U.S. made a strong effort to prevent WW2.  

Wilson also suggested collective security.  
The League would prevent an aggressor nation from expanding by reacting to it.  No nation will try to use force if it meant repercussions at the hand the League.

Did you know the United States never joined the League or signed the treaties?

Congress wanted to reserve the right to declare war.  As part of the LoN America would have to respond to threats abroad, and congress didn't want that.

Fair enough, the United States goes back into isolation.  

The league would become a quick failure since the European nations in it didn't want to commit forces to conflicts outside their borders.

Plus, what's the big deal if Japan conquered Manchuria, or Italy Ethiopia?  

Through the 20's the States still tried to prevent WW2.

President Harding called for disarmament among major powers.  Japan, and Europe was militarizing again.

The present day U.S. is criticized for its many wars, but at one point they wanted to outlaw it.

The Kellogg-Briand Pact stated military force was an unacceptable method of diplomacy.  Modern weapons were becoming far too powerful and dangerous.  

Did you know that in 1928, 62 governments agreed to it, including Japan, Italy, Germany, and the USSR?

By 1935, Hitler accepted a quest for ""lebensraum"" or ""living space"" for his Aryans.  Mussolini was still interested in Africa and Hideki Tojo of Japan was expanding into China.

THANKS AGAIN, the East.  A cataclysm was brewing.  The European powers did nothing until the entirety of Europe was under German influence minus Great Britain.  

Though, at this time the Great Depression was forcing domestic attention even if America wanted to intervene.

In fact, we didn't.  The Neutrality Acts of 1935 and 1936 reinforced that the United States shall remain a neutral state.

The American public didn't want war.  And neither did FDR.  He famously proclaimed we won't be sending our boys into battle.

Well, that was until Hitler was approaching the English Channel and Japan liked 2500 Americans at Pearl Harbor.

Germany declares war on America.  

Long story short, the now adolescent America saves the world for a second time.  

At this point one thing is clear.  America was forced onto the global stage twice while it tried to avoid it all it could.  People today criticizing American global presence should know this: your crap abroad forced us off the couch.  

What else do we learn from the past two devastating wars?  That by the time an imperial power begins to make its moves, it's too late.

Also, nuclear bombs are bad.  Real bad.

Even after WW2, though, America wasn't a unipolar power.  Because The Soviet Union quickly caught up to America and looked to spread communism.

Wonderful.  

Enter the Cold War.  The Cold War was cold because the two primary opposing powers never directly traded fire.

We used other means, such as third parties to accomplish our dirty deeds.  

America adopts containment.  An admission of USSR sphere of influence, but a refusal to accept its expansion of that sphere.  Which it tried, and we know by now expansion is bad.  But let's not act like the U.S. hadn't expanded (Philippines).

After the Cold War is when America became the stand alone Super Power.  The rest is history as we know it.

I wonder how history would have changed if there never was a WW1 or WW2?  What if the U.S. was able to extend isolationism?

Just some things I wanted to share, of you're the few who will read this, thanks! And add your input, as responsible voters and citizens of the world we should be as knowledgeable as possible.

tl;dr : America criticized for a lot of things but Europe screwed up bad a few times.

Have a good night everyone!

**Opinions-**

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.'

Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

* First Circuit Reversed 

* Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. 

-----

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

* The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

----

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf)

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

* Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/)

Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. 

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

Anyway, my current thought is that it's $450 or so that I could spend better at the moment. MA has an admission ceremony once a month, and NH has one twice a year, but will let you appear so long as you append a statement saying you've applied and are awaiting swearing-in (the sole difference is that you can't make a motion for pro hac vice admission of someone else). So in either case, I could pretty quickly be able to appear in a case/line of work that required it.

"2019-09-22",1569110474,"New paper rigorously analyzes the data from the Harvard AA lawsuit and finds lots of very interesting stuff about Harvards admission process. Details in post.","Heres the abstract:

&gt;	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the deans interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no ones surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

&gt;	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission& And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isnt really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

"2020-02-08",1581201509,"Appeals court holds university liable for ineffective Title IX policies","A federal court opinion could put the policies and procedures of colleges and universities in California and the western U.S. under a microscope for their ability to prevent sexual assault.

An institution can be held liable for pre-assault claims, which allege that its policies for enforcing Title IX are inadequate, create an environment of heightened risk of sexual misconduct and lead a complainant to be harassed or assaulted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared in a ruling Thursday. The federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex at institutions that receive federal funding and requires them to investigate reports of sexual misconduct 

Three former students who allege they were assaulted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 initially brought a case against the University of California systems Board of Regents in 2015 for Berkeley's handling of their individual complaints. When the case was dismissed in district court, the women appealed.

While many of the recent federal court decisions on Title IX have focused on the rights of respondents, the Ninth Circuit opinion is a big win for victims advocates, especially if other appeals courts follow suit, said Peter Lake, director of the Law Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.

The ruling by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circult referenced a 2014 California State Auditor report of Berkeleys processes under Title IX. The report found that from 2009 to 2013, Berkeley did not notify or give regular updates to parties involved in investigations of sexual misconduct, did not complete investigations in a timely manner and did not sufficiently educate staff and students on sexual misconduct prevention, which led cases to be mishandled and compromised student safety, according to the Ninth Circuit opinion.

Berkeleys use of an early resolution process that addressed complaints of sexual assault without formal investigations also came under fire in the courts opinion. It is standard for institutions to pursue early resolution or mediation between the complainant and respondent only in cases of sexual harassment and when both parties are in agreement, said Jake Sapp, deputy Title IX coordinator and compliance officer at Austin College, in Texas.

The former Berkeley students asserted that only two of the 500 cases of sexual misconduct reported to the university in 2012 were resolved in a formal process and that they were coerced into early resolution by the university. This was allegedly done so Berkeley did not have to report assaults under the Clery Act, which requires institutions to disclose crimes on their campuses, according to the students lawsuit.

Berkeley was ordered by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to revise its Title IX policies after a 2014 investigation by the agency. The university subsequently enacted many new policies, procedures and services over the last few years, according to a February 2018 statement from the university.

But the opinion could open other colleges and universities in the California system and elsewhere in the states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- to lawsuits that challenge the effectiveness of their Title IX policies, Lake said.

Contrary to other federal court opinions that address an institutions deliberate indifference to or inaction on a report of sexual misconduct after the fact, the Ninth Circuits opinion discusses what is known as before theory, Lake said.

If your state system does some analysis and finds inadequacies in terms of response, thats something that they will take more seriously, Lake said. This is a different kind of argument: that the policies themselves shut the door before anyone is able to provide notice.

The door is now open for plaintiffs to argue before theory in the Ninth Circuit. The opinion creates a broader standard than a similar case, Simpson v. University of Colorado, which said that colleges can be liable if there is knowledge of sexual misconduct in a specific program, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators. That case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado.

""It may be easier to establish a causal link between a schools policy of deliberate indifference and the plaintiffs harassment when the heightened risk of harassment exists in a specific program,"" the Ninth Circuit opinion said. ""But we will not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff could adequately allege causation even when a schools policy of deliberate indifference extends to sexual misconduct occurring across campus.""

The Ninth Circuit ruling did note that Title IX does not require California to purge its campus of sexual misconduct to avoid liability and that a university is not responsible for guaranteeing the good behavior of its students.

Sokolow believes most of the higher education institutions in California already hold a high standard for Title IX processes and will be unsurprised by this progressive opinion in the Ninth Circuit. But colleges and universities elsewhere might now look more closely at their admissions policies for special admits or transfer students, such as athletic scholarship recipients, for histories of sexual misconduct.

Its going to not only put individuals in the Ninth Circuit on alert but Title IX administrators across the nation, Sapp said.

Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who represents students accused of sexual assault, said the hope is that colleges do not become overly concerned with pre-assault claims and pursue cases that are not strong enough for investigation and disciplinary measures against accused students.

The hope is that universities will heed this and take measures to ensure that both Title IX complainants and respondents are treated fairly, equitably and given the due process protections that they deserve, Miltenberg wrote in an email.

The case will now return to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide whether to proceed with the claims against the Board of Regents based on the appeals courts new standard.

"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"

In short, racial subjugation is not an unintended consequence of the United States educational structure, it is an integral purpose of that structure.

Its that history that the United States Supreme Courts six conservative justices at best ignored, and at worst chose to perpetuate in striking down race based affirmative action in college admissions via the cases of Students for Fair Admissions v.

I am a political independent, but after a fairly wrong period of reading conservative sources and occasionally voting for Republicans, Ive come to the conclusion that at heart I am a Democrat and identify with the party, even if I don't always agree with the platform.

Might as well clear out my differences with the Dems.

1. Disagreed with foreign policy. Thought withdrawal from Iraq could lead to destablization of region (which already happened I guess.) Other defense issues

2. At times thought Dems did not give business (including big business) enough credit for job creation.

3.  Not always receptive to idea of private/charter schools which actually can do a lot to help certain students succeed, even if at the price of lack of funding for public schools. Sort of tied in with this has been a kneejerk hostility to faith based initiatives or even faith in general among some sectors of the base

These and other issues have caused me to be way of identifying myself as a Democrat and at least in certain elections made me a swing voter.

But Ive taken stock of things and weighed the two parties and their animating spirits as a whole and found the Democrats superior. Why?

The Democrats as a whole believe in using the power of government as a force for good in the country. They may be wrong ( in my mind) at times, but also very right in many cases.

As a whole the Democratic party seems to acknowledge societal faults and flaws, and their politicians at least admit that they and their colleagues are obligated to draft legislation to remedy those problems.

What I admire about the Democratic Party is it's sense of noblesse oblige, or need of those who are well off and powerful to be responsive those who lack power and wealth.

This is in stark contrast with the Republican party, especially these days. By admission, much of the parties base don't wish to see the government help anyone, or really have their politicians have some higher purpose for being in office.

Democratic politicians consitently advocate a fairer, more equitable society, equal opportunities for people regardless of race, gender, etc, a commitment to preserving environment,  better education etc. etc. . They  may exaggerate what they are able to accomplish, or be insincere about their commitments to certain causes, but at least they hold those causes as their own, and they typically are inspiring ones that encourage the voters to think beyond their immediate if comfortable little world and life

Republicans by contrast have far viewer inspring or high minded causes. I suppose they have ""supporting the military and freedom"" and preserving America from the ""Radical Feminist/Homosexual Agenda"", and that only works if you have a religious worldview that is threatened by either imagined agenda.

Apart from that though, it seems that Republican causes are mostly selfish in appearance, pretty much advocating that government stay out of people's lives and pocketbooks so they can enjoy more of their own hard earned money. Some will argue that they are doing people and society good by cutting taxes on high earners/businesses since if taxes/regulations less businesses create more jobs.

I think its possible that could be the case, but for some reason I don't think the GOP voters desire for either is based off of altruism/ res publica.

I don't think its an exaggeration to say that the average GOP world view is marked by a distinct lack of compassion. Basically it's 1. The poor brought it upon themselves 2. Keep the foreigners away from me, 3.Don't raise my taxes even if education in my area is abysmal.

Even one of the GOP's main selling points, Character/Moral values no longer even hold water. That worked at some level when Bob Dole ran against Bill Clinton, but given the whole Roy Moore debacle, (to say nothing of the Donald) that isn't something the GOP and conservative Christians even care about anymore.

What do you think of my post? I hope I did not offend by some of my earlier critiques of the Left/Democratic Party

"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin.

For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

"2014-01-14",1389675579,"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","When I see AAs arguing against affirmative action, most immediately go with the assumption that this is a conflict between minorities. They see their opponents are other underprivileged minorities who gets all the positions that they didn't get. The proposed solution that they give is always complete abolition, which I see as unlikely, especially in more liberal states.

I think the angle of approach to this issue needs to change in order to convince more people. Don't think of this problem as a dog-eat-dog contest between minorities. There are actually fairly good arguments for helping historically disadvantaged African Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to defeat it.

Instead the really unfair part of affirmative action (for me) is the fact that AAs actually have a HARDER time than Caucasians in this system. This makes absolutely no sense. Caucasians get white privilege, pre-existing old-boy social networks and historical legacy benefits, while AAs suffered historical discrimination and higher poverty rate, AND they should be given an even harder time now compared to white people? I am really surprised and disgruntled that this is not pointed out more whenever affirmative action is brought up.

If the admission rates of Caucasians and AAs for colleges are on the same level adjusted for test score (or in some better measure of admission equality, we are equal), I would be perfectly fine with affirmative action. It is a reasonable statement that white people don't need a crutch in life over Asians, right?

This point could have been chewed to death in some AA blog circles. I haven't been in the AA activism community for too long, so it is likely that I missed it. However, I have never seen it presented online, so I thought to get some discussions on it.","asianamerican",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1v63z3/discussion_i_dont_see_why_the_affirmative_action/"

At a time where many university students are examining the role of race in places of elite and privileged learning, many on this forum have asked what our role as AAs are among other minority groups. 

One of the things to highlight may be how elite institutions (e.g. the Ivy League), have put into place discriminatory quotas in AA admissions. Several peer reviewed academic papers have concluded that there is very real statistical evidence that such a quota exists (ironically, the more heavily cited ones come from Princeton). 

Perhaps if we too are to join other PoC in their fight, perhaps our place is to also ask elite institutions for transparency. The Ivy League notoriously keeps admissions statistics private, however, if they are to have a fair and balanced admission strategy, perhaps they too should not worry about releasing the GPAs, SATs, and other factors by race.

As the title of this post suggests, I have **DOCUMENTED** long-term medical issues that caused me to tank my GRE scores. I have included the back-story below if you have interest in reading it. What I am looking for is advice on how to work it into a personal statement without it coming off as an excuse or giving the vibe that I am incapable of completing graduate school. I want to make the point that, yes my medical issues have played a role in my performance, but I HAVE done things about it and I think that my scores do NOT represent my abilities. 

Even more helpful, I would be deeply appreciative if someone who has participated in an admissions committee would look over this part of my personal statement and give me feedback. Please PM me if you are willing to do this (I am expecting to write only a paragraph or two)

**Backstory**: 
 Sometime last fall semester (actually I could say it started in the spring of 2011 in a lot of ways), out of nowhere I developed gastrointestinal problems. At first the effects were pretty mild--I missed class some mornings and had episodes of going to the bathroom after dinner, but overall it wasn't too bad. I went to the doctor who told me it was due to smoking, coffee and anxiety, so I quit smoking and I quit coffee and went on with life. Still nothing changed  so I sucked it up and went on with life because I didn't have time to deal with it. Slowly but surely my symptoms began worsening. I missed more class. I started having to visit the bathroom during exams. I started having painful cramps throughout my entire abdomen and back to the point that I would be unable to leave me house. 

By early spring semester the effects had become so severe that my attendance dropped by 50% and I had trouble performing on exams. During one of my thermal exams I had to leave the room 19 times. Yes, **19 times**. This, of course, led to some suspicion and interrogation, but I was very embarrassed about my conditions so I never mentioned it, and just told the prof I had a stomach bug.

This spring was also the spring my research took off. Days I stayed home due to not being able to leave the bathroom, I dragged my computer in with me and did as much work as I could. This led to me winning a few awards and a spot at an international math conference in march. **Oh god, this was the worst experience for me**. I did well at the conference, but only because I self medicated, using 3x the recommended dose of over the counter medicine. This did not dull the pain, though. I continued on because I wanted to, and I had to. It's my dream to be a physicist, and sure it sucks to have this condition, but I made it through and I did a damn good job. 

Of course, at this conference a prof in our group noticed my frequent bathroom trips and told me I should seek out help because I could have celiacs disease (which my grandmother has). Upon my return to campus, as it was the end of the semester, I did just that. This led to a summer of blood tests, colonoscopies and medicinal cocktails. The doctors found nothing. No one knows what's wrong with me (though they prescribed me $1000/mo medicine with possibly fatal side effects...). I decided to take my exam results and visit a campus medical professional who put me on my current miracle medicine.  She furthermore advised me to go to the student disability center, which I did. As of this fall I am officially documented by my educational institution, with a folder full of examination results and my complaints.

So this brings us to now. Over the summer I adopted a very strict diet and have adhered to my prescribed medicine. I have also taken up cycling. These things in combination have basically eliminated my symptoms, restoring my ability to attend and preform in class. I still experience the intense cramping, though, at unpredictable times, especially if I am generally stressed or have come into contact with unagreeable food. 

About 1/3 of the way through my subject GRE, I reached to take my medicine from my bag (which I was told I could have). I was immediately yelled at by the proctor and I was not permitted to take my medication. Not ten minutes later, the anxiety got to me and my stomach began to cramp and I had a very difficult time concentrating. The scores have not come back yet, but I am not expecting anything wonderful. 

I took the general GRE, and I became very stressed out because they told me I would have to sign out (a 3-5 minute process) if I wanted a sip of water or to use the bathroom. This pretty much immediately made my stomach cramp. As this exam is 4 hours long, one can imagine that I didn't fair well. My scores are pitiful for my goals (75% in quant and 78% verbal 4 writing), I am trying to get into a top ten school in mathematical science... and my verbal score is HIGHER than my quant. 

You might ask, well, why didn't you sign up for the accommodated GRE? Well- I tried. I didn't know about my qualifications for this until september. I made an appointment with my doctor, filled out the forms and everything. There was a small error on the application and it was rejected two weeks before my test date. It takes two weeks to get an appointment with my doctor. There was no chance after that, and I did my best to medicate and meditate. Honestly, I didn't expect to have the issues I did. I have been doing pretty fine on in class examinations. It turns out not having access to water and a restroom in a 3+ hour long exam takes a serious freaking toll on me. C'est la vie.


So the net effect of this disease has taken one A to an A- and two A's to B+'s (in a physics speech class and thermal). It has likely obliterated my subject GRE score. It put me at a 75th percentile for quantitative reasoning, despite having a 4.0 in my applied math major (I doubled). 

Its just heart breaking to me. I just worked my ass off for years to have a great transcript, nearly 4.0's in both majors (not in my cume though =/), excellent research and likely a publication in the near future, and it will ALL be tanked over some crummy exams. I really need to counteract this in a sincere way. Can someone please help me?

"2013-05-28",1369705367,"Resuming undegrad study with academia as a long-term goal (xpost from r/gradschool)","Hi everyone. Looking for some advice about getting back on track, ideally with academia as the goal.
First, a brief historical outline.

Starting in fall 2008 I attended a fairly selective school, studying International Relations. As it happened, it wasn't the best fit, and I eventually became depressed to the point where my grades were severely impacted. I withdrew after the fall 2011 semester. In hindsight, I should have left sooner, but a combination of denial and a desire to simply finish kept me there. Because of withdrawals, I left with approximately 3 years of credits completed and a mediocre GPA.

I've spent the intervening time pursuing treatment for depression, and working for some portion of the time. I've been trying to identify what I really want to do with my life. After some soul-searching, I came to the conclusion that my dream job would be in academia. Short version of my focus would be historical demography (History with heavy Geography leanings). As an aside, I'm pretty well informed about the prospects that lead this way, so advice more substantial than ""don't"" would be appreciated.

Anyway, I'm finally feeling ready to get back into the saddle, and try to get back on track, though I don't have the slightest idea about where to start. I'm planning on taking some open-enrollment courses at a local university this summer to help demonstrate that I'm ready to go back to serious study. I don't plan on returning to my original university.
Basically, my questions are: How should I go about getting back into undergraduate study if eventual higher level study is the goal? What should I look for in a school and program? Spring 2014 admission is the earliest it'd be feasible for me to re-enroll somewhere. What should I do until then? Has this whole episode soured things to the point where it really isn't feasible?

Thanks","academia",1,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/1f68ec/resuming_undegrad_study_with_academia_as_a/"
"2023-01-13",1673569014,"Seeking Advice for Econ PhD Route","Hey folks,

I am seeking advice on whether I should apply for Econ PhDs or seek a different field based on my academic background, goals, and current situation. I've read a couple similar posts in this community and others, but hopefully people with experience can offer advice tailored to my particular background.

I majored in Economics with a math focus as an undergraduate (about 3.7 gpa), so I have experience in calc 1-3, linear algebra, and a prerequisite calc proofs class for real analysis. It is worth mentioning, however, that I have not taken real analysis, and I don't know if this significantly bars me from admission to most programs. I have scored a 167 on the math GRE after my second attempt. I have finished a master's degree in sociology (about 3.9 gpa), but realized that the more mathematical/policy approach to economics more closely suited my research interests.

I am motivated to get a PhD because I am driven both by the prospect of research and teaching. I envision a rewarding career as one in which I can learn about concepts that interest me, contribute to society's understanding of economic topics, and advance the field. I feel like I picked my research topic in sociology because it was something that was useful to society, not because it was something that really interested me a ton - and I now recognize the need to pursue a genuine interest in a PhD program. I currently work in a fairly well-paying job doing IT consulting work, but I feel like my motivation is far stronger toward learning more about society and policy from an economic perspective.

Regarding career goals, I would love a professorship that enabled me to balance teaching, researching, and writing about my interests on the side. Teaching and research are both very important to me, so I don't want to have to pick one or the other. I don't have a strong desire to be the most published academic or top-ranking professor at an Ivy League. I want to have health insurance and get a house someday, but I have no desire to be rich.

Last year, I sent in about 6 applications and was rejected by every program. For context, these were all top 25 schools except for one that was about top 50. I had great letters and felt like I put together a decent statement of purpose. I did not reach out to any professors at these schools ahead of applying, and I'm not sure how much this hurt my applications.

Here are my questions:

1. Based on my interests and goals, does a PhD in economics sound like something you would recommend pursuing?
2. How important is attending a top-ranked school given the goals I outlined? What is the lowest rank you would recommend applying to?
3. What would you recommend doing differently to increase my chances of acceptance if I apply again?
4. Do I have to take real analysis to have a decent shot?

I have secured 2/3 references that are quite strong, one that knows me fairly well since it is a fairly small class and is focused on mini-research projects, and my undergraduate thesis supervisor. However, the final Professor I have contacted was one I have published a paper with in the past, and I have reached out to this professor twice already, but I have not received a reply back. 

Presently, I am struggling to find another Professor that knows me well enough to write me a recommendation, as they are all surface level connections from courses I have taken and have done well in the past. I am worried that this will dampen my chances of getting a placement within the Master's Program I am planning to apply to.

In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the high courts six-justice conservative majority found that the universities discriminated against white and Asian American applicants by using race-conscious policies that benefited applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.

We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today. he wrote.

I'm 63 and I'm Tired
by Robert A. Hall    


I'm 63.  Except for one semester in college when jobs were scarce and a six-month period when I was between jobs, but job-hunting every day, I've worked, hard, since I was 18. Despite some health challenges, I still put in 50-hour weeks, and haven't called in sick in seven or eight years. I make a good salary, but I didn't inherit my job or my income, and I worked to get where I am. Given the economy, there's no retirement in sight, and I'm tired. Very tired.  

I'm tired of being told that I have to ""spread the wealth"" to people who don't have my work ethic. I'm tired of being told the government will take the money I earned, by force if necessary, and give it to people too lazy to earn it.  

I'm tired of being told that I have to pay more taxes to ""keep people in their homes.""  Sure, if they lost their jobs or got sick, I'm willing to help. But if they bought McMansions at three times the price of our paid-off, $250,000 condo, on one-third of my salary, then let the left-wing Congress-critters who passed Fannie and Freddie and the Community Reinvestment Act that created the bubble help them with their own money.  

I'm tired of being told how bad  America  is by left-wing millionaires like Michael Moore, George Soros and Hollywood Entertainers who live in luxury because of the opportunities  America  offers. In thirty years, if they get their way, the United States  will have the economy of  Zimbabwe , the freedom of the press of  China , the crime and violence of Mexico , the tolerance for Christian people of   Iran , and the freedom of speech of Venezuela .

I'm tired of being told that Islam is a ""Religion of Peace,"" when every day I can read dozens of stories of Muslim men killing their sisters, wives and daughters for their family ""honor""; of Muslims rioting over some slight offense; of Muslims murdering Christian and Jews because they aren't ""believers""; of Muslims burning schools for girls; of Muslims stoning teenage rape victims to death for ""adultery""; of Muslims mutilating the genitals of little girls; all in the name of Allah, because the Qur'an and Shari'a law tells them to.  

I'm tired of being told that ""race doesn't matter"" in the post-racial world of Obama, when it's all that matters in affirmative action jobs, lower college admission and graduation standards for minorities (harming them the most), government contract set-asides, tolerance for the ghetto culture of violence and fatherless children that hurts minorities more than anyone, and in the appointment of U.S. Senators from Illinois.  

I think it's very cool that we have a black president and that a black child is doing her homework at the desk where Lincoln  wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. I just wish the black president was Condi Rice, or someone who believes more in freedom and the individual and less arrogantly of an all-knowing government.  

I'm tired of a news media that thinks Bush's fundraising and inaugural expenses were obscene, but that think Obama's, at triple the cost, were wonderful; that thinks Bush exercising daily was a waste of presidential time, but Obama exercising is a great example for the public to control weight and stress; that picked over every line of Bush's military records, but never demanded that Kerry release his; that slammed Palin, with two years as governor, for being too inexperienced for VP, but touted Obama with three years as senator as potentially the best president ever. Wonder why people are dropping their subscriptions or switching to Fox News?  Get a clue. I didn't vote for Bush in 2000, but the media and Kerry drove me to his camp in 2004.  

I'm tired of being told that out of ""tolerance for other cultures"" we must let  Saudi Arabia  use our oil money to fund mosques and madrassa Islamic schools to preach hate in  America , while no American group is allowed to fund a church, synagogue or religious school in  Saudi Arabia  to teach love and tolerance.  

I'm tired of being told I must lower my living standard to fight global warming, which no one is allowed to debate. My wife and I live in a two-bedroom apartment and carpool together five miles to our jobs. We also own a  three-bedroom condo where our daughter and granddaughter live. Our carbon footprint is about 5% of Al Gore's, and if you're greener than Gore, you're green enough.  

I'm tired of being told that drug addicts have a disease, and I must help support and treat them, and pay for the damage they do. Did a giant germ rush out of a dark alley, grab them, and stuff white powder up their noses while they tried to fight it off? I don't think Gay people choose to be Gay, but I damn sure think druggies chose to take drugs. And I'm tired of harassment from cool people treating me like a freak when I tell them I never tried marijuana.  

I'm tired of illegal aliens being called ""undocumented workers,"" especially the ones who aren't working, but are living on welfare or crime. What's next?  Calling drug dealers, ""Undocumented Pharmacists""?  And, no,  I'm not against Hispanics. Most of them are Catholic, and it's been a few hundred years since Catholics wanted to kill me for my religion.  I'm willing to fast track for citizenship any Hispanic person, who can speak English, doesn't have a criminal record and who is self-supporting without family on welfare, or who serves honorably for three years in our military.... Those are the citizens we need.  

I'm tired of latte liberals and journalists, who would never wear the uniform of the Republic themselves, or let their entitlement-handicapped kids near a recruiting station, trashing our military. They and their kids can sit at home, never having to make split-second decisions under life and death circumstances, and bad mouth better people than themselves. Do bad things happen in war?  You bet. Do our troops sometimes misbehave?  Sure. Does this compare with the atrocities that were the policy of our enemies for the last fifty years and still are?  Not even close.  So here's the deal. I'll let myself be subjected to all the humiliation and abuse that was heaped on terrorists at Abu Ghraib or Gitmo, and the critics can let themselves be subject to captivity by the Muslims, who tortured and beheaded Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, or the Muslims who tortured and murdered Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in Lebanon, or the Muslims who ran the blood-spattered Al Qaeda torture rooms our troops found in Iraq, or the Muslims who cut off the heads of schoolgirls in Indonesia, because the girls were Christian. Then we'll compare notes. British and American soldiers are the only troops in history that civilians came to for help and handouts, instead of hiding from in fear.  

I'm tired of people telling me that their party has a corner on virtue and the other party has a corner on corruption. Read the papers; bums are bipartisan. And I'm tired of people telling me we need bipartisanship. I live in  Illinois , where the ""Illinois Combine"" of Democrats has worked to loot the public for years. Not to mention the tax cheats in Obama's cabinet.  

I'm tired of hearing wealthy athletes, entertainers and politicians of both parties talking about innocent mistakes, stupid mistakes or youthful mistakes, when we all know they think their only mistake was getting caught. I'm tired of people with a sense of entitlement, rich or poor.  

Speaking of poor, I'm tired of hearing people with air-conditioned homes, color TVs and two cars called poor. The majority of Americans didn't have that in 1970, but we didn't know we were ""poor."" The poverty pimps have to keep changing the definition of poor to keep the dollars flowing.  

I'm real tired of people who don't take responsibility for their lives and actions. I'm tired of hearing them blame the government, or discrimination or big-whatever for their problems.  

Yes, I'm damn tired. But I'm also glad to be 63. Because, mostly, I'm not going to have to see the world these people are making. I'm just sorry for my granddaughter.

One day very soon, you will be categorized, labeled and identified not by who you are but by the way you view the internet.

We as a country have allowed our fascination with emerging technology numb our brains in to thinking we are safe but in fact we are all lambs being led to slaughter.

Here is another reason that progressives should not be so quick to dismiss the libertarian distinction between public and private discrimination. Two years ago Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican who was then running for the Senate seat he now occupies, was pilloried for questioning the federal ban on private racial discrimination in places of ""public accommodation,"" on the assumption that anyone making such an argument must be either a naive ideologue or a closet racist. 

But the same property rights, freedom of association, and freedom of contract that allow bigoted businessmen to shun blacks make it possible for unpopular minorities to make a living, get ahead, and establish their own spheres of autonomy. These rights also would allow private institutions to pursue whatever race-conscious remedies they deemed appropriate in response to the lingering effects of slavery and institutionalized racism, no matter what the Supreme Court said.

**Opinions-**

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf)

* The Seventh Circuit is affirmed. 

* Justice Ginsburg writes the dissent with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joining.

**Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )**

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  in clear conflict with this Courts decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf)

* First Circuit Reversed 

* Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. 

-----

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

* The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

----

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. 

* Eugene Volokh asks the big question of the day: ""Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?"" Some back and forth obviously occurred between the justices.""

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. 

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

what is a principled basis by which to determine that diversity is a sufficiently compelling government interest to justify limiting constitutionally protected individual rights (the right to not be discriminated against on the basis of race or national origin, as protected in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and federally guaranteed to all citizens by the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment)?

The practical question is - is the import of diversity sufficient to limit individual rights in college and university admissions?
The theoretical question is - what justifies something a government interest that should be weighed over a constitutionally protected individual right?","law",57,"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/6upsda/is_diversity_a_sufficiently_compelling_government/"

&amp;#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&amp;#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&amp;#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&amp;#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&amp;#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&amp;#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

"2020-02-25",1582604907,"'Education deserts' are a serious problem, and for-profit colleges are taking advantage","Its one thing to not be able to afford a college education. Its an entirely different issue altogether when you dont even have a college around you.

A recent report from Jain Family Institute (JFI) reveals that access to college isnt just about the cost of college. Physical access to public higher education institutions across America has also been highly unequal. 

Specifically, as detailed by JFIs interactive map, regions in Americas West have little-to-no access to an institution of higher education, compared to the East Coast.


One of the major takeaways when you're looking at the map is the staggering amount of populated areas that are considered highly concentrated, Laura Beamer, higher education finance project lead at JFI and one of the two authors of the study, told Yahoo Finance. We figured out that roughly 2.4 million prospective students have access to most one public option nearby & Though financial access is extremely important, geographic access is also a very important piece of this dialogue and should be talked about more.


The Rocky Mountain region is the worst off, the report added, followed closely by the Plains region. 

The JFI report  which drew on various points of data from the 2016-17 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, enrollment data from 2017, the 2016 5-year population, and median income estimates from the American Community Survey, driving durations to higher ed institutions in the area, zip codes, and more  created a School Concentration Index which measures the variation across the higher education market across different types of schools in the U.S. and U.S. territories. 

Four states  Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming  were found to have higher education institution monopolies or close to it, meaning that there is only one institution or very few schools to choose from.



Prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions

The authors found that a highly concentrated zip code (in red) means that there are few  or in some cases zero  higher education institutions in the area. A low concentration implies that there are a wide variety of options available for prospective students.

In the U.S., 38% of the population lives in highly concentrated zip codes, where they have access to very few or no higher education institutions, according to Beamer and her co-author Marshall Steinbaum, who is also an assistant professor of economics at the University of Utah. If a student from these areas wanted to attend a college or university, their commute would be at least 45 minutes.

The unequal access has wide-ranging implications for prospective students, most of them negative.

Parts of the U.S. where theres little to no access to a higher ed institution are prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions, just as they are known to draw disproportionately from populations historically excluded from traditional higher ed on the basis of race and class, the authors argued.

The for-profit higher education sector saw tremendous growth since the financial crisis. In 2016, the New York Fed noted that enrollment at these schools had skyrocketed as the country emerged out of the Great Recession. For-profit colleges have also been known to saddle graduates with high levels of student debt, and in some cases, provide low-quality education with false promises of job placement.

The Obama administrations crackdown on for-profit colleges led to several closures, and recent action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pushed the University of Phoenix to put a stop to deceptive advertising of lucrative job opportunities.

Despite government action, for-profits persist due to these gaps in availability.



A school could ... possibly practice price discrimination

So why are schools so unequally distributed across the U.S. in the first place? 

It comes down to the structure that that states have put in place and just haven't been able to update over the last few decades, Beamer said. There is a rural versus urban dynamic as well & schools are going to open in places where there's a labor market and where there's a large population of students. 

The biggest problem arising is a neglect of the West, the researchers argue, where a school could determine prices and access unilaterally and possibly practice price discrimination.

More broadly, the issues raises a more philosophical question about what higher education represents.

We have this idea that higher education as a societal institution is egalitarian & there's also a lot of reasons why it isn't, said Steinbaum. This is one tiny piece of evidence among a broad painting of the fact that the higher education system is extremely stratified.

They're screwed on the front end as well as the other end

Another problem of education deserts trickles down below higher education.

Folks in these certain geographic areas which more often tend to be rural, have fewer options, Ryan Wells, associate professor of higher education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Yahoo Finance.

Rural students not only had fewer options for college, he explained, but they also had fewer resources to prepare them for college in the first place when compared to their suburban or urban counterparts.

It's kind of like   to put it crassly  they're screwed on the front end with what they have with their preparation and their resources and things to be ready for college, Wells said, and then fewer options on the other end as well.


Responsible colleges offer a way out

Fortunately, there are some good actors that restore faith in the system.

The University of Wyoming  despite having monopoly status  takes its job to offer accessible higher education seriously. 

We are quite a blue-collar state, University of Wyoming spokesperson Chad Baldwin told Yahoo Finance. Only about 24% of our adults have a bachelor's degree or higher [so] one of our goals is to try to lift the educational attainment level.

Baldwin noted that the university has a broad open admissions standard: Our acceptance rate is something in the order of 97%. Furthermore, according to Baldwin, more than half of the universitys graduates who started as first-time students didnt graduate with any student loan debt, thanks to low tuition and fees, and a state scholarship program.

The tuition for a Wyoming resident undergraduate for a year is about $6,300, he added.

Factoring in living costs and so on, that comes up to about $13,000 per year, based on data from the Department of Educations College Scorecard

"2020-02-08",1581201509,"Appeals court holds university liable for ineffective Title IX policies","A federal court opinion could put the policies and procedures of colleges and universities in California and the western U.S. under a microscope for their ability to prevent sexual assault.

An institution can be held liable for pre-assault claims, which allege that its policies for enforcing Title IX are inadequate, create an environment of heightened risk of sexual misconduct and lead a complainant to be harassed or assaulted, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declared in a ruling Thursday. The federal law prohibits discrimination based on sex at institutions that receive federal funding and requires them to investigate reports of sexual misconduct 

Three former students who allege they were assaulted at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2012 initially brought a case against the University of California systems Board of Regents in 2015 for Berkeley's handling of their individual complaints. When the case was dismissed in district court, the women appealed.

While many of the recent federal court decisions on Title IX have focused on the rights of respondents, the Ninth Circuit opinion is a big win for victims advocates, especially if other appeals courts follow suit, said Peter Lake, director of the Law Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.

The ruling by the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circult referenced a 2014 California State Auditor report of Berkeleys processes under Title IX. The report found that from 2009 to 2013, Berkeley did not notify or give regular updates to parties involved in investigations of sexual misconduct, did not complete investigations in a timely manner and did not sufficiently educate staff and students on sexual misconduct prevention, which led cases to be mishandled and compromised student safety, according to the Ninth Circuit opinion.

Berkeleys use of an early resolution process that addressed complaints of sexual assault without formal investigations also came under fire in the courts opinion. It is standard for institutions to pursue early resolution or mediation between the complainant and respondent only in cases of sexual harassment and when both parties are in agreement, said Jake Sapp, deputy Title IX coordinator and compliance officer at Austin College, in Texas.

The former Berkeley students asserted that only two of the 500 cases of sexual misconduct reported to the university in 2012 were resolved in a formal process and that they were coerced into early resolution by the university. This was allegedly done so Berkeley did not have to report assaults under the Clery Act, which requires institutions to disclose crimes on their campuses, according to the students lawsuit.

Berkeley was ordered by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to revise its Title IX policies after a 2014 investigation by the agency. The university subsequently enacted many new policies, procedures and services over the last few years, according to a February 2018 statement from the university.

But the opinion could open other colleges and universities in the California system and elsewhere in the states covered by the Ninth Circuit -- Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington -- to lawsuits that challenge the effectiveness of their Title IX policies, Lake said.

Contrary to other federal court opinions that address an institutions deliberate indifference to or inaction on a report of sexual misconduct after the fact, the Ninth Circuits opinion discusses what is known as before theory, Lake said.

If your state system does some analysis and finds inadequacies in terms of response, thats something that they will take more seriously, Lake said. This is a different kind of argument: that the policies themselves shut the door before anyone is able to provide notice.

The door is now open for plaintiffs to argue before theory in the Ninth Circuit. The opinion creates a broader standard than a similar case, Simpson v. University of Colorado, which said that colleges can be liable if there is knowledge of sexual misconduct in a specific program, said Brett Sokolow, president of the Association of Title IX Administrators. That case was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado.

""It may be easier to establish a causal link between a schools policy of deliberate indifference and the plaintiffs harassment when the heightened risk of harassment exists in a specific program,"" the Ninth Circuit opinion said. ""But we will not foreclose the possibility that a plaintiff could adequately allege causation even when a schools policy of deliberate indifference extends to sexual misconduct occurring across campus.""

The Ninth Circuit ruling did note that Title IX does not require California to purge its campus of sexual misconduct to avoid liability and that a university is not responsible for guaranteeing the good behavior of its students.

Sokolow believes most of the higher education institutions in California already hold a high standard for Title IX processes and will be unsurprised by this progressive opinion in the Ninth Circuit. But colleges and universities elsewhere might now look more closely at their admissions policies for special admits or transfer students, such as athletic scholarship recipients, for histories of sexual misconduct.

Its going to not only put individuals in the Ninth Circuit on alert but Title IX administrators across the nation, Sapp said.

Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who represents students accused of sexual assault, said the hope is that colleges do not become overly concerned with pre-assault claims and pursue cases that are not strong enough for investigation and disciplinary measures against accused students.

The hope is that universities will heed this and take measures to ensure that both Title IX complainants and respondents are treated fairly, equitably and given the due process protections that they deserve, Miltenberg wrote in an email.

The case will now return to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, which will decide whether to proceed with the claims against the Board of Regents based on the appeals courts new standard.

"2022-08-26",1661534091,"[NYTimes] Affirmative Action Was Banned at Two Top Universities. They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}

"2020-08-12",1597269737,"We dont waste fellowships on women: Microbiologist Rita Colwell on sexism in academia","Congress had excluded white-collar professionals from the equal pay for equal work provisions of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Three years later, however, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued Executive Order 11375 prohibiting federal contractors from discriminating against women when hiring. Researching the subject, Sandler spotted a footnote. Being an academic, she said, I read footnotes, so I turned to the back of the book to read it. And there, Sandler found a way forward for women like herself: by taking federal funds, the University of Maryland (and all research universities receiving federal funding) had become a federal contractor. It was a genuine Eureka moment, Sandler later wrote. I actually shrieked aloud. 

Working with the Womens Equity Action League, a small Ohio group focusing on economic and legal issues with educational institutions, Sandler filed a class action suit against the University of Maryland and 250 other American colleges and universities. She based many of the cases on evidence of bias in hiring, tenure decisions, promotions, and salaries sent to her by women from all over the country. Although Sandler would win some of these lawsuits, the lack of enforcement powers in Johnsons executive order muted her victories. There were no penalties for the offending universities to pay or procedures put in place to reverse the inequities. Thankfully, the story didnt end there.

Instead, the issue of employment bias moved quietly to Congress, where Representative Edith Green, an Oregon Democrat and former schoolteacher, was passionately interested in womens equality in education. Having accumulated enough seniority to chair a House subcommittee on education, she held hearings on sex discrimination in academia. Then Green made a savvy move: she moved the legislation that would come to be known as Title IX through Congress so stealthily that almost no onenot the men who voted for it nor the educational establishment that would be tasked with carrying it outknew what was happening.

Quietly organizing her forces, Green hired Sandler to coach her staff about gender discrimination in academia, while Vincent Macaluso, a sympathetic federal expert in the Department of Labor, provided secret advice on strategy. Morag Simchak, also from the Department of Labor, drafted an amendment so forbiddingly technical that she knew no one would even attempt to read it. Sandler reported tongue in cheek that Simchak, having informed her superiors once about her work on drafting the amendment, did not feel any great need to inform them again. Several months later, Green, without informing her colleagues in the House of Representatives about the implications of what she was doing, slipped Simchaks short passage banning sex discrimination in any educational program receiving federal aid into what would become the Educational Amendments Act of 1972. Once the passage was in the bill, Green ordered the leaders of womens groups not to lobby for Title IX of the act. She didnt want to alert the men in Congress to its importance. And so, still happily oblivious to what Title IX meant, Congress made it illegal to discriminate against women in education and gave individual women the power to sue universities in order to hold on to their jobs, protest tenure or employment decisions, and demand equal pay.

The university athletic establishment considered the Educational Amendments Act of 1972 a very minor bill, Sandler would later explain. The word sports was not even in it. A month later, Jonathan Spivak of the Wall Street Journal broke the real story under a masterfully understated headline: Sex-Bias Section Could Spark Controversy.

Worried about losing federal funds, university lawyers promptly ordered some quick fixes. Old-style anti-nepotism bans against hiring faculty wives gave way to modern prohibitions against relatives supervising relatives. Almost overnight, a few leading scientists were leapfrogged three steps up the academic ladder, from research associate to professor, including two women mentioned in the previous chapter Violet B. Haas, the brilliant mathematician in Purdues engineering department, and Dora Priaulx Henry, the barnacle expert at the University of Washington  and several accomplished research associates at Harvard. Thousands of women suddenly received big pay raises, often without explanation and generally without back pay. For the first time, educational institutions had to publicly advertise job searches, end gender quotas for admission to graduate and professional schools, and pay equal stipends for male and female graduate students  although white men continued to get prestigious research assistantships while women and other groups underrepresented in science continued to receive less-prestigious teaching assistantships.

Above all, Title IX allowed us to believe change was possible. But those of us who also hoped Title IX would take care of sexism in science were soon dismayed.

About three times a year, the team put on a performance for the whole school. On one of the performances, she didnt allow a subset of the 8th grade population. It was the UC Davis team which had all the special ed students as well as mainstream students in it. 
I am guessing she discriminated on the basis of disabled kids. But she probably thought it was a legal loophole by not allowing the whole team from seeing the performance. 
Even if she didnt discriminate on the basis of disability, not allowing part of the school population from seeing a school performance, it still sounds illegal because they should be open to ALL the students since her production is funded by taxpayers-she was a school employee and using school property to execute the rehearsals and performances. 
If she had her own production outside of school funded by her own money, then she can deny admission to whoever she wants, but its wrong to do that on a production funded by taxpayers. Legally, she didnt even own any of the productions that she created at school because she was an employee of the school district and since it was created within the scope of her employment, the school district owns the rights to the production aka work-for-hire.
Anyways, am I correct on how its illegal to not allow part of the school population to see her production?

SAT and ACT have been thought to favor rich students and give them a leg up in the college admission process. Test preps, academic support, ability to redo the SAT many times are some privileges enjoyed by wealthier students. 
 California State University has now permanently stopped using standardized SAT scores for admissions across all its campuses. More than two thirds of colleges in the US including Harvard have paused the  use of SAT. This has increased the number of black student admitted already. 

Colleges that have already axed the SATs are seeing more diversity. For example, 
Temple University student of color community grew to 45%up from 42% just a year ago and 39% the year before that. Both Black and Latinx students were admitted in record numbers.

My feeling is that even if they outlaw Affirmative Acton, and I think they will, we will be alright. The deck is stuck against us but black folk are never asleep at the switch. We already saw the inevitable end of Affirmative Action and started fighting for other ways to help ourselves. California State University had to be sued for discrimination which led to them axing the unfair standardized tests. I think once Affirmative Action is overturned by this conservative Supreme court, colleges will permanently stop using SAT, ACT for admissions.","blackladies",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/sjs5qi/forget_about_affirmative_action_eliminating_sat/"

Me:  Can you explain to me how white people are marginalized? 

Angry Guy:  That report from the United Nations Population Division explained it. Here's a current example from south of the border.  [https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/21/u-s-counties-majority-nonwhite/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?stzid=UgwSZf8b53hGUy4yMNR4AaABAg.9AaOcuBJaAn9AaSDOYnSnl&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXd0c0JlWkNvWmZCUkpHYm5QR3Zpc1o4X2p0d3xBQ3Jtc0ttYWdyUlRWM01YMVhkNEk3b1VSbzFQdmRSWk5TLVVHenktYmRWNGpUR3NPT1NUY2Y5ZmVtanFvelFvY3BBRzg5OE14ZndXWXNRdGRUdGJkWUxxTWcyeFZLdmcyUnNkV1lIRW1haVBHUkpfRzlBZTl4OA%3D%3D&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewresearch.org%2Ffact-tank%2F2019%2F08%2F21%2Fu-s-counties-majority-nonwhite%2F&amp;html_redirect=1&amp;event=comments) I suspect that's why people in the Identity Politics industry are starting to use a new term called ""racialized"" instead of ""minorities."". 

Me:  First of all, the article is about is the shifting demographics in the USA. The article suggests that white people are no longer the majority in various counties. However, if you pay close attention to the wording used, they were comparing white demographics to nonwhite demographics. This means that they lumped all minority populations (black, east asian, south asian, hispanic, middle eastern, etc.) within a county together and compared it to the population of one single race (white). The majority race in the counties mentioned may be (and probably are) still white, but when compared to the ENTIRE nonwhite population they are seen as the minority.  Second of all, marginalization is ""(of a person, group, or concept) treated as insignificant or peripheral."" This article only touches upon the changing demographics of the USA and does not explain how white people are being treated as insignificant in society. Minority is not synonymous with marginalized. Although minority groups are often marginalized, this does not automatically mean that every single minority group will face marginalization. Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority, can you give me an example of how white people are being marginalized? If you are a white person yourself, perhaps you could give me an example of how you have been marginalized in the past? 

Angry Guy:  "" Even if what you say is true, and white people are becoming the minority"" I didn't say anything. I merely quoted a U.N. demographic report.   "" give me an example of how white people are being marginalized?"" Again, that U.N. report is a forecast. A forecast that they have already had to projects upwards, There will be no population plateau or stabilization. It will continue to grow exponentially.  If 10% of the global population isn't a minority, I don't know whats is.  And that 10% includes non-Whites already living in the West, which is why I included that Pew research report.  Oh btw, I'm a Native living on a Indian reserve. Go ahead, ask me anything. I just tell it like it is.

Me:  Lol I'll ask again can you give me an example of how white people are treated as insignificant in society since you believe that they are marginalized? The article clearly has nothing to do with marginalization.  Also, in regards to when you said ""and then there will be no more racism or hate, amirite?"" If you had watched the whole video you would know that we talked about colourism and receiving hate within our race. We addressed the fact that there is work to be done within our own community as well and never claimed that all racism and hate comes from white people. 

Angry Guy:  I'll point out once again that the U.N. report I quoted is a \*forecast\*, something soon to be. So ask me in 2050 how White people will be marginalized.

Me:  I don't think you understand that being the minority is not the same as being marginalized. No where in the UN report does it say that white people will be marginalized. Where is the assumption that white people will be marginalized coming from because you're evidence has nothing to do with marginalization. 

Angry Guy:  No, of course the U.N. would make no such admission, lol. It's simple math really. The White population, and by White I mean Europeans and their descendants, aka ""the West"",  has been in steady decline since the 1960's and the advent of Feminism and ""the Pill"". Countries where Feminism has no inroad have seen their populations explode. Sadly, in many nations females have no say over their bodies. It's their parents who decide who they marry and how many babies to have. Sad.   So, it's just a matter of time before Whites are about rare as unicorns.

"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

Much like the crack epidemic not given attention when it was a 'black problem', and need for 'intervention' to help opioid addicts who are now manly a white demographic, we have a similar analogy with Asian Americans.

To this very fucking day, Caucasian provosts (WASP/Jewish) routinely use non transparent admissions policies, while taking on huge grants and fellowships from taxpayer dollars (ie Pell) to deny  Asian Americans admissions into their universities. A lot of the focus has been on undergrad in these discrepencies, but its more pronounces in grad programs. I once read, for instance, that MCAT score ranges for admitted Asians were around the 90% , while for Latinos it was around 60% (majority of whom are of course blanco/whites.

It got me thinking. My family has doctors in it who  took immense risks, had to spend more time/capital (ie get another mastesr) to 're-brand' themselves for med school. $200k+ med school debt isn't unheard of, horrible living conditions to 'save', mental stress if they don't get in, etc.

Why is it that we are discussing 'student debt relief' before we discuss the non transparent admissions processes that discriminate asian americans?

They were one of the 60 groups lobbying against Harvard for discrimination.

Q&amp;amp;A on the Life or Death of 80-20 PAC

Q1:  Why has 80-20 PAC chosen death rather than hanging on?

&gt;80-20 has seen many similar AsAm organizations providing negative service to our community. 80-20 PAC could one day become a negative-service organization. So it is better to cease operations  than struggle to hang on.

**Q2:  Negative service?  Could you give an example?**

&gt;**The support for ""race conscious"" college admissions by many so-called ""AsAm civil rights orgs"" is one example.** Even when discrimination against  AsAm  college applicants became so obvious  that school counselors have to advise our kids to hide their AsAm ethnic  background  when applying - a clear  indication that AsAms don't even have  the minimal human  rights of  self-respect, these civil right orgs still didn't change their position.  How ugly the real world can be!

**Q3:  Do these civil rights org. WANT to harm our community? (A must read!!)**

&gt;NO!  They drifted into it.  The first generation founders were usually volunteers &amp;amp; had noble  intentions .  But sooner or later, they  faded away.  The later leaders were usually paid a salary. They might not be as dedicated  and/or as capable. Lacking prestige, the subsequent  leaders couldn't raise enough money from the  AsAm community.   **So they  began to go after grants from the generous mainstream foundations  and corporations.**     

&gt;However, raising money  from American orgs, that support civil rights, is almost impossible WITHOUT THE BLESSINGS of  NAACP. NAACP has won civil rights for all minorities of America, including us.   However, does NAACP always have the same interests as AsAms?    No!!  That is when AsAm civil rights orgs would and will support policies at  the expense of AsAms.   Money talks!   Make it talk for us.

Q4:  So is it the fault of these civil rights orgs?

&gt;NO!   The subsequent leaders of our civil rights orgs are mostly new college graduates.  They may be too young to face the tough real world.  

&gt;Personally, I primarily blame the successful AsAm business leaders  who, as a group, don't have the wisdom to bear the responsibility of financing  the  necessary community infrastructures - PACs, civil rights orgs, &amp;amp; think-tanks.

&gt;Instead, our rich  people compete  to give money to Harvard and buy a name on a Harvard  building.   A recent NY Times satire, entitled ""Harvard Admissions Needs 'Moneyball for Life' ""  stated: 
      
&gt;"" They (meaning the rich people who climb over each other to donate to Harvard)  weren't  put on earth to alleviate human suffering, or to make it a different and  better place. They were put on earth  to erect a building  with their name on it, in a place it  can be  seen and admired by other people like  them!""   

&gt;Please ""google"" to find out which wealthy AsAms are these belittled moneyballs. 

&gt;   The unwillingness of AsAm rich and powerful to invest in our community contrasts strikingly other minority communities.  Most AsAms are NOT willing to speak out on this point  for fear of offending these folks.  However, someone has to point out this HUGE weakness.  

              ""To those whom much is given, much is required."" 
                             -  John F. Kennedy, a Harvard graduate



80/20 has been one of our community's most staunch pro-Asian PACs for decades, and it didn't sell out like a lot of our other activist organizations that were desperate for funding.  Now is the time to make your commitment clear?  Please donate to help keep this organization alive, it's literally Zion and they're under siege by the Machines.  If they collapse, then one of the last bulwarks we have against White Supremacy is going to be destroyed.  I'm calling out to all Asian America.

"2014-01-14",1389675579,"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","When I see AAs arguing against affirmative action, most immediately go with the assumption that this is a conflict between minorities. They see their opponents are other underprivileged minorities who gets all the positions that they didn't get. The proposed solution that they give is always complete abolition, which I see as unlikely, especially in more liberal states.

I think the angle of approach to this issue needs to change in order to convince more people. Don't think of this problem as a dog-eat-dog contest between minorities. There are actually fairly good arguments for helping historically disadvantaged African Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to defeat it.

Instead the really unfair part of affirmative action (for me) is the fact that AAs actually have a HARDER time than Caucasians in this system. This makes absolutely no sense. Caucasians get white privilege, pre-existing old-boy social networks and historical legacy benefits, while AAs suffered historical discrimination and higher poverty rate, AND they should be given an even harder time now compared to white people? I am really surprised and disgruntled that this is not pointed out more whenever affirmative action is brought up.

If the admission rates of Caucasians and AAs for colleges are on the same level adjusted for test score (or in some better measure of admission equality, we are equal), I would be perfectly fine with affirmative action. It is a reasonable statement that white people don't need a crutch in life over Asians, right?

This point could have been chewed to death in some AA blog circles. I haven't been in the AA activism community for too long, so it is likely that I missed it. However, I have never seen it presented online, so I thought to get some discussions on it.","asianamerican",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1v63z3/discussion_i_dont_see_why_the_affirmative_action/"
"2013-08-07",1375846976,"Affirmative Action  Harming Asians Most","I hate how Asians are stereotyped as being superior to Whites in college admissions, which forces them to limit their ranges of Asian students in incoming classes. That combined with the need to have diverse females and males screws over Asians. I was told by a former UPenn admissions officer that the worst demographic to be is Asian Male for all the reasons you can think of.

The NYT article Little Asia on the Hill explores the little known problem of Affirmative Action that affects Asian Americans. The article begins by describing how UC Berkley had a record high for Asians in their freshman class and what it was like for a student to be among such a large population of Asian students in the university.

&gt;    But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it  specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.

There have been long running suspicions among the Asian American community that they were often denied admission or wait-listed to make room for other students considered to be disadvantaged minorities. I find it interesting that although universities pride themselves on being tolerant and diverse, their admissions office uses a combination of stereotypes and impossible standards to create what they believe to be an incoming class with perfect diversity. It seems absurd that admissions officials would assess an Asian student at a much higher standard than his White counterparts because they are a supposedly superior Model Minority while judging African-Americans and Hispanics at a much lower standard using Whites as a neutral benchmark because they are implied to be inferior disadvantaged minorities. Additionally, it is even more racist to use Whites as a neutral standard in judging which groups are superior to receive harder burdens from the admissions officers, while using a lesser standard on the other groups, which appear to reaffirm the age-old American perception that Asians are superior while Blacks/Hispanics are not.

&gt;    Asians have become the new Jews, in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, The Price of Admission: How Americas Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges  and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.

&gt;    As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent)  despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.

&gt;    To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.

&gt;    This is just a very, very egregious system, Mr. Li told me. Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.

&gt;    To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.

&gt;    Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. Im not seeking anything personally, he says. Im happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.","asianamerican",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1juzmv/affirmative_action_harming_asians_most/"

One of the things to highlight may be how elite institutions (e.g. the Ivy League), have put into place discriminatory quotas in AA admissions. Several peer reviewed academic papers have concluded that there is very real statistical evidence that such a quota exists (ironically, the more heavily cited ones come from Princeton). 

Perhaps if we too are to join other PoC in their fight, perhaps our place is to also ask elite institutions for transparency.

"2019-04-23",1556041025,"Does this sub really have a disdain for Affirmative Action?","After looking up some information about Affirmative Action, I also saw a reddit thread on this sub with many people saying AA shouldn't have been implemented to begin with. After searching ""Affirmative Action Reddit"", I came across even more posts and comments like this from this sub. I want to present an argument, and then a question based on the premise of the argument. I myself am Asian American, so I had to fill in the box when applying for schools too you know. Anyways.

Let's start with median incomes in the US

Asians - 80K  
White - 61K  
US median - 57K  
Pacific Islander - 57K  
Hispanic/Latino - 46K  
Other races - 44K  
Native American - 39K  
Black - 38K

So basically, Affirmative Action serves to be one of many, MANY initiatives aiming to get any race under the US median TO the US median. In theory, if all humans are capable of the same achievements in our civilization then discrepancies shouldn't be this great. But it's very obvious how the median incomes drop hard between Pacific Islanders and Hispanic/Latinos, and once again down to Native Americans and Blacks considered against the ""others"" option.

It may be worth it to also present these groups by per capita income as well

Asians - 34K  
White - 32K  
Pacific Islander - 21K  
Black - 20K  
Native American - 18K  
Hispanic/Latino - 16K

Amazingly, the drop off happens after White and that's it. Black Americans aren't actually at the bottom per-capita, which probably implies that there are more people poorer than the median than richer. Just to be clear, since the per-capita incomes are all less than the medians here, ALL of America's per-capita incomes have a bell curve that skews left. [An example just to be absolutely sure we're on the same page](http://jse.amstat.org/v13n2/vonhippel_figure1.gif). It's just that some skew harder or have less of a tail, implied by the re-ordering.

Back to affirmative action. Basically, Affirmative Action is a policy implemented by certain public systems, and even the private sector, to determine who is suitable for acceptance into a school, workplace, etc. when competition is present. It leads to outcomes where if two people of similar merit went for a job, but one was from a race which has a higher per-capita income, then they might be not be favoured. This is seen as controversial by many, because it can be seen as racist.

I believe that, despite being Asian American, I don't really mind Affirmative Action as a concept. I DO believe it needs reform, especially since poor whites are left behind by these programs, but it is sound in-theory simply because the different in income stats is so great that there's CLEARLY a problem that needs fixing here just due to America's history. If initiatives aren't taken to alleviate these problems in a meritocracy, then we could end up repeating the cycle that brought us to this point, as Americans.  


1. These income ratios between races would stay the same
2. After some time, the lesser income races would get profiled as uneducated, dangerous, etc. simply due to their lower average income (even when they're middle class).
3. Successful kids from lower income races succeed, and start to favour affirmative action due to these problems.
4. Affirmative Action is implemented
5. Affirmative Action is cut due to being against the idea of a perfect meritocracy
6. Repeat?  


Let me put it this way. What would you, as a person, see as more impressive? A black kid born into a low-income neighborhood with parents that value education but absolutely toxic bullies in elementary and middle school, and they don't have the means to send their kid to a private school. This black kid has to stay away from every bad influence he meets, even if that means becoming a total outcast. Also, he starts working a job while in highschool while some of his friends flunk entirely. He gets a 3.8 average in highschool regardless. He's also shown himself to have a kind heart and a passion for helping those around him. Or. A white kid born into a family where the father does Real-Estate somewhat successfully and the mother works in IT in a small company. This white kid's parents also value education, and they're able to send him to a private school as such. He gets a 3.6 there. However, colleges weigh students from that private school as 0.4 GPA higher relative to the black kid's public school. So he would effectively be a 4.0 student in public school, in their eyes. That said, he didn't really get bullied, and most bad influences were only as bad as they needed to be without actually doing bad academically. The truly bad influences, the types of guys that will flunk out, he also avoids just like the black kid, but at a private school there aren't many of those (I went to a private school and there was only 1 guy like that, period). Overall, he's a good kid with a kind heart too. Volunteers and does service all the time. Honestly, it may be hard, but I UNDERSTAND the reason AA would pick the black kid. By giving this black kid more resources than he ever had in the past, you have the potential to make a successful black kid, then a successful black adult, and then a successful black adult who also uplifts his originally low-income neighborhood if he chooses to stay around that culture. I've seen it with my own eyes too. I go to a mosque here in Atlanta in a black neighborhood occasionally, and the adults that lead this mosque are very proper and are always making strides to give back to the community. They've pretty much changed the culture in their part of Atlanta alongside the three churches and the school in that area, through what I've gathered talking to them (they're old people). I can affirm this, because going a few blocks east or west of that neighborhood brings you to uneducated Atlanta, like Pittsburgh or Lakewood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the context of AA for Asian Americans is that Asians have higher incomes and education, and it's HEAVILY due to the amount of vetting and barriers to immigration (AKA brain-drain from our ancestor countries ugh). But beyond this, I don't really see this as a big deal. I still got into the college I wanted to, a very prestigious one at that (Emory). In fact, my background of being the son of two doctors that went to a private school probably has something to do with it, considering I got a 3.2 in highschool. In the grand scheme of American civilization, I'm willing to have a slightly higher bar for success than others if it means that America as a whole is benefiting tenfold. Now, AGAIN, there are so many flaws with actual implemented AA, that I think prevents me from supporting it as it is now. I believe that it needs to be reformed so that it targets low-income situations much more than situations by race. There was a case of a low-income Asian being discriminated in Harvard admissions over a middle-income black kid that led to controversy a while back. In subsequent years, [movements](http://time.com/5425147/harvard-affirmative-action-trial-asian-american-students/) have been made to combat this problem, and I do agree with it to a certain extent. We need to target concentrated poverty, more or less. But otherwise I do support the mission it is trying to achieve. *The racial implications of AA only exist because #2 above happens, people make stereotypes of races based on the average income of that race and how people of those incomes usually act or live. And this leads to prejudice. If people weren't prone to casual racism, I do believe there'd be less support for AA. But is that reality? It's up to you to decide.*

Looking for either a reality check or some encouragement. Sorry if this is the wrong forum or whatever.

Bit of background: I graduated almost 10 years ago and left academia entirely due to a long standing delusion that god was speaking to me through my car radio. I was ""told"" that I should leave academia because if I succeeded then I would become sick and die. Instead, I landed a customer service job, pursing academic interests only as a hobby and trying my best to get through life. I had no idea through all this time that I was sick.

After an ""experiment"" landed me in the hospital, I was given the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. I got on medication and therapy and the difference is pronounced. I have been in treatment for almost a year with no resumption of symptoms. I have no delusions at the moment and-- most surprisingly-- I have my motivation for life back and my passion.

So... Im going to try to get into a graduate program like I always wanted to.

I know its probably unlikely I will get in anywhere considering my poor grades, my medical history, and my long gap, but I know I absolutely have to try. It makes me quite sad to think of a future wherein I cant study. I cant even *read other people's studies!*  It just sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is this:**

When explaining the reason for the gap in my resume, if I am honest about the reason why, what can I expect?

Is it worse to look like a insane person or a burn out?

Am I likely to face more or less discrimination in academia than I would elsewhere should my condition become public?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:**

I guess I should also ask if anyone has any advice on how to proceed. I dont have letters of rec, minimal experience, and only a standard grade point average (3.2) from a university ranked around #200 in the country. I also have about 50K in student loans, which I can suffer, but I want to try to take out as few additional loans as possible. I am hoping to go into a STEM field adjacent to my undergrad (Bio) in physical chemistry. I currently work doing development managment for a chemical manufacturer.

So, if anyone has advice on that it is welcome, though not necessary. If I can establish how up front I should be with an admissions officer or potential supervisor at the schools I am interested in, I imagine they can give me more concrete answers about application specifics.","academia",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/dvlb17/schizophrenia_knocked_me_out_but_now_i_want_back/"

"2022-11-23",1669218446,"""The shooter is nonbinary""","This is a public service announcement explaining the rules of this subreddit as it comes to the recent Colorado Springs murders and the position of this subreddit on LGBTQ+ people and the propaganda against them. 

As part of their defense, the legal team of the Colorado Springs nightclub shooter has [claimed](https://nypost.com/2022/11/23/colorado-shooting-suspect-anderson-aldrich-is-nonbinary-lawyers/) that their defendant is nonbinary. 

This would avoid them being charged with a hate crime.

The extreme-right has latched on to this news with the jubilant claim that it is not their relentless and vicious demonisation of queer and gender-nonconforming people that is to blame for the rise in violence against them. Instead they claim ""the call came from inside the house"".

Please be advised that on this subreddit such rhetoric will be met with a permanent and non-appealable ban.

Despite the claims of the extreme-right, it is a fact that endless stochastic terrorism from people like [Matt Walsh](https://aninjusticemag.com/stochastic-terrorism-and-right-wing-cowardice-bb4ea455d100), [Tucker Carlson](https://aninjusticemag.com/tucker-carlson-accused-me-of-child-abuse-and-told-the-state-to-take-my-daughter-away-cbf33313bb5), [Marjorie Taylor-Greene](https://www.advocate.com/politics/2022/8/16/attacks-lgbtq-community-amount-stochastic-terrorism) [et al](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/z10z7g/actual_terrorists/ix9830d/). have fostered an atmosphere in the US which has led to a rise in violent threats against non-cishet people.

Their endless lies and hate means that children's hospitals now [receive](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/threat-made-at-boston-childrens-hospital-police-confirm/2895206/) [bomb threats](https://www.advocate.com/news/2022/11/18/childrens-hospital-target-3rd-bomb-threat-over-trans-care) for [normal](https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf), medically and psychiatrically advised care. 

It means that [normal, fun and age-appropriate events for minors](https://www.today.com/parents/parents/proud-boys-disrupt-drag-queen-story-hour-kids-california-slurs-threats-rcna33497) are now threatened by brownshirts. 

It means that bills are passed which attempt to [illegalise trans people existing in public](https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3729828-tennessee-gop-files-bill-to-ban-drag-performances-in-public-spaces/).

All this and more is the direct result of the relentless stochastic terrorism from the extreme-right. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's be clear: Say for the sake of argument that the shooter identifies as non-binary. It is then still a fallacious and unacceptable argument to claim that their actions come from an inherent problem inside the LGBTQ+ community. Instead we know that the murderer comes from an extreme-right family and that their families political connections helped them [evade](https://apnews.com/article/gun-violence-shootings-colorado-politics-springs-ee6fe797a50cfca1bccfcc051c588187) a red-flag gun law. 

With their familial and cultural background the shooter will have been exposed to an endless barrage of anti-LGBTQ+ propaganda. It is not reasonable to claim that their identity absolves the extreme-right from its responsibility in this and similar tragedies, when it is their unending stochastic terrorism which fans the flames of hatred 24/7. 

--------------------------------------

Edit: [Their booking sheet lists them as male and their mother used he/ him pronouns to refer to them while texting them on the day of the shooting](https://www.thedailybeast.com/aaron-brink-pornstar-dad-of-colorado-club-q-shooting-suspect-anderson-lee-aldrich-spews-homophobia).

------------------------------------------

[Fascism](https://jackfisherbooks.com/2017/07/11/on-fascism-and-why-it-fails/) is an inherently empty ideology, devoid of any meaningful belief-system or any kind of concrete and actionable strategies for improving society. [Fascism](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism) only cares for power for the sake of power and it cares for nothing else.

Because a [fascist system](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/are-trump-republicans-fascists/) is fundamentally incapable of giving the general public any kind of reasonable platform it must gain and keep followers by creating an out-group to hate. According to [fascist systems](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/11/fox-news-tucker-carlson-documentary-fascism/) it is *the other* that is responsible for all societal ills and only by supporting the fascists in getting rid of *the other* can society be healed from the non-existent issues fascism convinces people that their target minority is the cause of.

Fascism always picks on a vulnerable target. 

The demonisation and villification coming from the extreme-right is doing exactly that. By calling LGBTQ+ people child molestors simply for existing it has become inevitable that people will take up violence ""to protect the children"". 

This subreddit will not tolerate such rhetoric.

Not any of it. 

--------------------------------------------------

- [Drag is not inherently sexual](https://aninjusticemag.com/the-conservative-sexualization-of-drag-55e7d510d535).

- Gender-affirming care is [medically and psychiatrically recommended](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/news/gender-affirming-care-saves-lives) and proven to improve lives.

- Trans children often know they are trans when their [gender identity](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx) develops, around the age of five. 

- LGBTQ+ people visibly existing is not ""grooming"" and children knowing about the existence of LGBTQ+ people is [not harmful](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5127283/) to them.

- Being [transgender](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/frequently-asked-questions-about-transgender-people) or [intersex](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2018/10/its-intersex-awareness-day-here-are-5-myths-we-need-to-shatter/) is a normal and natural variant of the human experience. Being trans is not inherently harmful to either the trans person, nor their surroundings. 

-----------------------------

This subreddit is a *sanctuary space*.

Extreme-right rhetoric will be harshly dealt with.

So if you want to sneer at people and claim that it was not the fault of the hateful and dangerous atmosphere created by fascist propaganda that violence against LGBTQ+ people is committed then you can do it elsewhere. 

It is not allowed here.

Please don't use this word because it makes no sense.I agree that there are evil racist individuals but the idea that there is a group or system that specifically targets a race is absolute bullshit. It is promoting this toxic victim mentality even more. We aren't living the god damn 1950s or 60s where there are Jim Crow Laws. The government is not targeting any group of people purely based on skin color. CHILL THE FUCK OUT. AND USE YOUR OPPORTUNITIES. EVERY AGREES THAT RACISM IS TERRIBLE BUT ONLY 9 UNARMED BLACK MEN WERE KILLED BY POLICE in 2019. 18 white men were by police in 2019. A police is 18 times more likely to get killed by a black man that vice versa. SOMEONE ElSE WHO COMMITED A CRIME/ would be in jail if not killed but HAPPENS TO SHARE THE SAME SKIN COLOR AS YOU IS BEING KILLED NOT YOU. TO PEOPLE WHO SAY MINORITIES ARE BEING OPPRESED: GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL. GO TO COLLEGE. DON'T HAVE KIDS TILL YOUR MARRIED AND WELL SETTLED. AND STOP COMITTING CRIMES. THE PERCENT OF SINGLE BLACK MOTHERS HAS GONE UP FROM 20% in 1960s to over 70% is 2019. DO PEOPLE REALIZE HOW CRAZY THAT IS. 7/10 black babies are born to a single mothers who were irressponisble. CHANGE FUCKING CULTURE. ITS NOT A RACIAL THING, IN FACT WE HAVE MORE AN EASIER EDUCATIONAL PATH BECAUSE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. NO WHITE MAN HAS MORE RIGHTS THAN  A BLACK MAN.

**A direct quote from this so-called president from the above article:  To parents of transgender children, affirming your childs identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy, Biden said.**

How is this true? My 4yr old son identifies as a T-Rex (that's not a joke, he acts like a T-Rex). Should I allow him to think he is a dinosaur because he identifies that way? Of course not. Why? Because it's not true, *AND* he's a child and he doesn't know  better.

When I was a child, I wanted to be a knight, then a firefighter, then a GI Joe, then a football player... Should my parents have had me undergo some type of genetic mutation therapy to affirm each of these childish whims?

I think God they didn't. Because I'm an adult and can now think for myself, and I'm an analyst and I like it. 

When your child ""wants"" to be the other gender, tell them what they are. Either a boy or a girl. THEN, if they decide as an adult that they want to transition to the other gender - that's on them.

"2022-01-24",1643065125,"Just so Dissapointed","I feel like I'm the most pro-USA guy of my generation. I'm Gen Z, but I grew up absolutely loving America. I donned the red white and blue every Fourth, I exhumed patriotism my whole life. It was a running joke that I was the most obnoxiously pro-American around. But now, I'm apparently a far-right conspiracy theorist. It's just a shame. I believe in the 1776 America I don't recognize this 1984 hellhole the democrats have created. 

I ""woke up"" to the nonsense when Trump ran for President. I knew something was weird when the media joined forces to attack him, when odd things were leaked to the press, and when likely untrue stories clouded headlines for literal months on end. I knew Dems rigged the primary for Hillary. I knew that the MSM and media were exploiting the American people's emotions - pro women, pro LGBTQ, pro immigrant. All of those causes deserve serious attention, but it just seemed so obvious to me that it was all a sham. I would talk to my classmates about why they liked certain policies, and their logic always began and ended with ""because I'm not a racist/sexist/homophobe"". That is, in a nutshell, the liberal morality. There is no positive duty, nothing to actually do, no tangible goal or plan. It's a group of people who just want to tear others down, or force you to sit down and be a part of the crowd so as not to upset anyone. They're a miserable crowd.

Thank God Trump won. Thank God. He exposed all of this. He's not perfect, but he is probably the only person who could have done what he did. He had enough power and money to hit back at the establishment. Nobody else could have hit back, let alone take a hit, like Trump did. Man, he is tough. 

We suffered through four years of Russia hoaxes. We suffered through years of totally basis insults and calls of racism and sexism. The media grew more and more provocative, more and more hateful, and once they had the masses just overwhelmed with this false fury, they stopped reporting facts entirely. 

Trump won the 2020 election. There is simply so much evidence that he beat Biden but for voting dumps, and it is insanity to me that people just went along with the media. It was scary, those days after the election. The media was scary affirmative that Joe Biden won the election. They did not allow any debate. It was certainly an orchestrated thing. What scared me more was how willing people were to just accept it. 

COVID has also been a lie. Obviously it's a real disease, and many have died, however, anyone can see that it has been used by feds to usurp a ton of power unconstitutionally. The actions that have been taken, from closing businesses, to inflating the economy, to forcing the jab on people are authoritarian measures and nothing can tell me otherwise. They were maybe justified to some degree, but I don't think so now, having all the information that I do. 

Why did the establishment do this to us? Why did they go through all the effort to rig the vote, spread a false narrative about COVID, and do everything they can to promote Biden and his administration when all that it accomplishes is the demise of our country? Biden is literally trying to tear us apart. He utilizes the most aggressive, civil war-instigating rhetoric I've ever heard! And he's a god damned fool! His weakness is allowing Russia and China to tip the scales of geopolitical power for generations to come. 

This show, these series of events, which the democrats have set into motion, destroyed American greatness. I don't know why they did it. Did they really do it because they thought it was right? Are they stupid? I just don't get it. I'm ashamed of this country. I'm angry at the people that did this. I want to make things right. I just don't know how. I feel powerless.","Republican",8,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/sbz4j1/just_so_dissapointed/"

Its leaders were pilfering millions of dollars and buying multi-million-dollar mansions all in the name of racism.

Worse, their founders were communists who hated America and were hiding behind a catchy slogan.

Source: [https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/black-lives-matter-leaders-arent-capitalist-converts-they-still-want](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/commentary/black-lives-matter-leaders-arent-capitalist-converts-they-still-want)

Black Lives Matter was just another con job. Although most people (including Conservatives) agreed with the motto Black Lives Matter, not everyone knew there was a non-profit organization behind the scenes fleecing donors.

Liberals who want to cancel conservatives are usually not good students of history. The Republican Party was formed to end slavery and it was patriotic abolitionist Republicans that left the farms and factories and marched to Civil War battlefields to end the scourge of slavery. There was never any question whether Republicans believed that Black Lives Matter. Without them, slavery would have remained a sacred Southern institution. On the other side were the Southern Democrats who were willing to fight and die to continue the injustice of slavery.

The liberal media, many of them black female journalists, decided to make Veronica Wu a sacrificial lamb and cancel her. It didnt matter that Veronica Wu was perhaps the most successful venture capitalist in the United States at the time helping to create thousands upon thousands of high paying jobs in Silicon Valley.

It didn't matter that Veronica Wu was herself a female minority. Veronica Wu had crossed the line and had the audacity to stand up against the dogma of the liberal left. **And she would be pay dearly.**

This was surprising because Veronica Wu wasn't a media personality. Unless you worked in the venture capital space you probably had never heard of her. And Veronica Wu didn't post her disdain for the Black Lives Matter organization on a public forum or blog -- it was a private email to a co-worker who later became disgruntled.

The disgruntled co-worker knew exactly how to game the system. The co-worker was also a female minority. She simply took the email and shared it with black female journalists who were only too happy to take the bait and destroy the career of our one our best and brightest minds.

Veronica Wu is an immigrant from China and attended Yale and later received a Ph.D Berkeley. She worked alongside some of the most well-known names in technology including Steve Jobs and Elon Musk. Veronica helped form Tesla China and hired the person who is currently overseeing everything Tesla does in China. And before that she was a leader at Apple overseeing an Asian division that increased 50x under her leadership and generated over a billion dollars in revenue.

Her track record as a venture capitalist was even more impressive and included over **34 unicorns that became $1+ billion dollar companies.** The journalists never interviewed Veronica. They simply took the word of a disgruntled co-worker and posted Veronica's private email.

Here is the email that incensed the liberal media and corporate America:

&amp;#x200B;

Source: [https://www.axios.com/2021/09/02/venture-capital-investor-racism](https://www.axios.com/2021/09/02/venture-capital-investor-racism)

The great irony is that **everything Veronica Wu said is accurate!** We should live in a meritocracy. On a sidenote, the groups that are being discriminated against academically are Asians due to affirmative action bias toward other minority groups.

If anyone should be complaining about discrimination it is high achieving Asians who are held to a different standard.

These journalists, again many of them black females, contacted all the boards where Veronica Wu was a director. This included VF corporation and Capgemini. And did those corporations defend Veronica Wu and tell these angry liberals to stop defaming members of their team?

Of course not, the minute the liberal media began pounding on the door Veronica Wu was forced to step down. And the liberal media gleefully covered the story of VF Corporation forcing Veronica out the door. VF Corporation owns such brands as **North Face, Vans, and Supreme**.

Source: [https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/veronica-wu-vf-corp/](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/veronica-wu-vf-corp/)

Axios, Business Insider, Yahoo News, and other liberal rags pulled off a hit job and the conservatives were silent. They just let it happen and didn't complain. You could hear a pin drop. And the result is that all of these so called ""news organizations"" are allowed to participate in career assassination with impunity. And companies like VF Corporation and Capgemini are co-conspirators and allowed to push the left's agenda without any response from the right.

But as the Bob Dylan song goes, ""The times they are changin'."" The Black Lives Matter organization has been exposed for the fraud that it is, but that's not enough. Instead of punishing people like Veronica Wu for sharing the truth, we should reward them.

Instead of being canceled by angry racists, their voices should amplified.

We should take the time to bring this injustice in the light of day. Everyone should know what VF Corporation and Capgemini did to Veronica. And that the liberals in San Francisco continue to punish Veronica Wu to this day -- banning her from events the minute they read that she questioned the conventional wisdom regarding the fraud ridden organization Black Lives Matter.

Conservative CEOs should seek out people like Veronica Wu and other who has stand up against the real racism in America. Instead of turning our backs on those willing to voice the truth we should embrace them.

How does adding a record 5.5 trillion in debt in a mere four years - devaluing the dollar, the purchasing power of businesses and consumers - help create jobs, more disposable income, in a rising sea of inflation? Why is it, AGAIN, Democrats refused to agree to a balanced budge amendment, instead opting to raise the debt ceiling in lieu of slashing wasteful programs? Did America not just lose its AAA credit rating for the first time ever? Surely, the greatest industrial power the world has ever known did not just log a month with zero economic growth; the first time since the Great Depression? And after 41 straight months of unemployment above 8% - another Obama original - not to mention a record number of home foreclosures, is that floaties I see on the flailing arms of Middle America?

"2014-06-08",1402196340,"Affirmative Action for Conservative Views?","It seems like every right wing/libertarian is complaining that they're views aren't getting exposed enough. They complain that it's a ""circlejerk"" and a downvote something or another.And it seems that the mods are SUPER SUPER sympathetic with their complaints.

**So I thought we should discuss it as a community. Do you really think there should be affirmative action for conservative views?**

I for one am absolutely sick of the CNN present a conservative &amp; present a liberal and have them argue both sides. It pretends as if the scientific weight of the evidence is equal on both sides. How many more times do we have to discuss climate change, or income inequality? These things exist. They're real, and the people who are experts in their field have no equivocation about them. There is already a multi-billion dollar industry tasked with helping right wing/libertarian talking points reach as wide of an audience as possible(no climate change, no income inequality, guns guns guns guns, etc). Can we really argue that not using mod authority to make these minority  (on Reddit) views more salient is some great injustice? Or as if there's some great injustice not balancing Reddit with opinions already spun from a billion dollar propaganda machine such as ""weather changes all the time""?

Lastly - I'd like to talk about the Elaboration Likelihood Model of attitude formation. It's premised on the idea that if you know very little about a very complicated subject (""Low Elaboration likelihood), like climate change, income inequality, then you will make your decisions on superficial determinants like who the speaker is, his position, his emotional posture, etc, amount of cognitive ease an argument allows you in etc etc (i.e. simple arguments that need little cognitive resources to evaluate are more likely to be believed). More importantly, you'll use these determinants instead of actual complicated things like facts, research, informed analysis from experts. This is exactly what the Mods are trying to do with Reddit. Their main focus isn't the truth of a matter. They act like politics is some realm divorced from the real world where nothing is falsifiable. And they spend all their time talking about ""bias, politeness, affirmative action of other view points, and concern trolling about the problem of a circlejerk."" And they feel these secondary considerations are the primary indicator of intelligent conversation.

I've studied a lot of research on attitude formation. And almost everything Mods and affirmative action conservatives say is so painfully based off of low information processing according to the ELM. Their arguments are mostly something along the lines of ""both parties bad."" ""OMG so liberal,"" ""OMG you disagree with different viewpoints gosh!"" Instead of actually discussing the peer reviewed evidence, scientific methods, expert opinions and factual information relevant to the discussion. They in themselves are making an argument based on cognitive ease - all viewpoints = better. This is  a simple argument to understand, takes almost 0 cognitive effort, those people who don't know the intricacies between policies decisions will likely just believe that. It's frustrating seeing people with such power follow such non logical views of how intellectual discourse should look like. 

Here's an example. If we were trying to determine the answer to 2 + 2. One party says 4 another party says 5. Instead of checking the math to see who's right, the Mods would have us check to see how many people are in unison agreement and whether we have a adequate variety of opinions. They'll carefully assess the tone of each person. Knowing that there can't possibly be a right answer, so the person who speaks with certitude and dismissal of other ideas, is probably wrong. They'll stress the importance of what the 3rd party that deviate from the two dominant views (""both side are the same evil party"") are saying since their impartiality makes them correct. If too many people are saying 4, they'll say ""It's a shame that we have people disagreeing with others for their opinions. The best forum is a place where people don't downvote others in oblivion just for ""disagreeing. (raise your hand if you've heard this talking point 10 times this week). But what they'll never do is actual math. 

While these secondary considerations have their place in fact finding, they certainly don't deserve a prime seat. And it seems almost all discussion in /r/politics dissolves into this. Low Elaboration likelihood discussions. And then they sit back with an air of worldly intelligence as if this type of discussion is intellectual and asking ""tough questions."" And marvel and how gentlemanly they are to ""view all viewpoints equally."" Even worse, the mods who have clearly never read one peer reviewed article about the science of persuasion, media manipulation, correcting misconceptions and how fact finding in public forums works, will then give others speeches about how terrible they are at understanding how policy discussion works. 

SO I honestly ask. Can we please, please end this madness of only discussing secondary considerations (i.e. whether there's enough conservative views, whether it's a circle jerk), and focus on primary considerations, like whether 2 + 2 is indeed 4 or 5. I know when you are looking at very complicated answers, it seems that there is no falsifiable answer. But this is soooo not true. Whether you like to believe it or not, some viewpoints are indeed right or wrong. We shouldn't be forced to listen to viewpoints that hve **been consistently proven to be wrong** because of a misguided view that these secondary considerations are what makes for intelligent discourse.

Nothing surprising: it's very apolitical, and a nearly identical speech could have been given by McCain if he had won. But I bet that the people who have been fearmongering about this speech, the Glenn Becks of the world, will comb through this transcript word-by-word to find something, anything, to criticize, just so they don't have to admit they were wrong.

Here, I'll do it for them!

* ""When I was young, my family lived in Indonesia for a few years..."" -- RADICAL MADRASSA!! HE WANTS TO TURN OUR SCHOOLS INTO MUSLIN ISLAMOFASCIST MADRASSAS!!!!

* ""Ive talked about your parents responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and get your homework done, and dont spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox."" -- HE'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY PARENTS' PERSONAL FREEDOM IN DECIDING HOW TO RAISE THEIR KIDS!!!!

* ""Youll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment."" -- GLOBAL WARMING IS A FAKE LIE AND AIDS IS GOD'S PUNISHMENT FOR FAGS!!!!! GOD BLESS AIDS AND OUR OIL WELLS!!!!

* ""Youll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free."" -- PEOPLE ARE POOR AND HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY! THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR HELP!! ALSO DISCRIMINATION IS OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT!!! AND ""MAKING OUR NATION MORE FAIR"" SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALIST WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION!!!!

* ""But I was fortunate. I got a lot of second chances and had the opportunity to go to college, and law school, and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didnt have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country."" -- IT WAS ALL JUST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION!! THEY TRYING TO KEEP THE WHITE MAN DOWN!!!! DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE SAID HE ONCE SAW A VIDEO WHERE MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS ""WHITEY""????!?!!

* ""Jazmin, Andoni and Shantell arent any different from any of you."" -- YES THEY ARE, THEY ALL SOUND LIKE FILTHY ILLEGAL FORRINURS!!!! THEY SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO AFRICA AND MEXICO OR WHATEVER!!!

* ""Maybe youll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community."" -- LIKE A _COMMUNITY ORGANIZER_??!?!??! OBAMA IS GOING TO MAKE ALL OF OUR KIDS JOIN ACORN AND TURN IT INTO HIS HITLER YOUTH!!!!!

* ""So find an adult you trust  a parent, grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor  and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals."" -- HE DIDN'T MENTION CLERGY AS AN OPTION THERE!!!! WHY DOES OBAMA HATE CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS AND GOOD ALL-AMERICAN PATRIOTS SUCH AS JESUS CHRIST??!?!?

* ""Im working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books, equipment and computers you need to learn. But youve got to do your part too."" -- 'DO YOUR PART TOO'????! THAT SOUNDS LIKE _FASCIST COMMUNISM_!!!!

I'll be surprised if none of these objections are seriously raised in the next few days.

""**When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.**

**We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.** ""


**Everyone Needs To Empty Into The Streets, ARMED!**

- Do Not Seek Violence but be Ready to Defend yourself, family, friends, and your community.

Constitutional Rights Guaranteed to Natural Human Persons Only and Not Corporations; 3. Public Financing of Political Campaigns; 4. 21 Year Term Limits for All Offices.","**Four Constitutional Amendments we desperately need.**

1. Congress itself shall be subject to all the laws it makes which are binding upon the People.  Congress shall make no law granting itself or its members any special privileges, immunities, or exemptions from law other than those already provided for in this Constitution; and any such special privileges in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered null and void and entirely severable - whether embodied in statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom - immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing Congress from enacting any law or promulgating any rule which sole purpose is to guarantee or enhance the physical security or safety of the Congress, its members, employees, contractors, buildings, offices, or grounds. 

2.  The rights guaranteed to individuals, persons, and the People under this Constitution are guaranteed to natural born human persons only, and no rights whatsoever are guaranteed or granted or implied by this Constitution to corporations or other artificial legal entities. Any and every existing contrary provision of any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom purporting or affirming the embodiment of corporate personal rights in this Constitution in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered  null and void, without effect, and entirely severable immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Congress may also enact legislation to endow corporations and other legal entities with whatever rights, privileges, and responsibilities it deems suitable and fitting, provided that any such rights and privileges granted may never supersede or diminish the rights and privileges guaranteed to natural born human persons under this Constitution. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as absolving any corporation of legal accountability for its actions, forgiving any corporate debts, or nullifying any existing judgement against any corporation in suit at law or equity.

3.  All elections at every level of government in these United States shall be financed by public funding only, except that bone-fide individual natural human citizens of the United States may directly contribute an amount not to exceed an annual total of five hundred dollars to all parties combined to the candidates and issue advocacy groups of their choice. No political party or committee may have any influence over the allocation and distribution of public funds, and the requirements for eligibility to receive public funding shall be the same for all persons seeking the same office, regardless of political party affiliation or non-affiliation.  This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

4. No person shall serve in any one elected or appointed government office, including judiciary offices, for more than a total of twenty-one years in their entire lifetime. This Article amends any contrary provision of this Constitution, and renders any and every existing contrary statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom null and void and of no effect and entirely severable. This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

Edit:  Added ""Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing Congress from enacting any law or promulgating any rule which sole purpose is to guarantee or enhance the physical security or safety of the Congress, its members, employees, contractors, buildings, offices, or grounds."" Changed word ""granting such rights"" to ""purporting or affirming the embodiment of corporate personal rights in this Constitution"" in item #2.  Also appended "" Congress may also enact legislation to endow corporations and other legal entities with whatever rights and privileges it deems suitable and fitting, provided that such rights and privileges may never supersede or diminish the rights and privileges guaranteed to natural human persons under this Constitution."" to the end of item #2. Inserted word ""born"". Added "" Nothing in this Article shall be construed as absolving any corporation of legal accountability for its actions, forgiving any corporate debts, or nullifying any existing judgement against any corporation in suit at law or equity.""

"2015-06-27",1435402699,"Compiled each of the Supreme Court Justice remarks on Friday's same sex marriage decision, along with the trascript of President Obama's address to the nation.","[Each Justices remarks on the verdict](https://trove.com/a/10-key-lines-from-the-Supreme-Court-decision-and-dissent-%E2%80%94-and-why-they-mattered.ivFRW?nocrawl=1&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=sns&amp;utm_campaign=hosted)  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majoritys approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens  through the democratic process  to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution  even as confined to opposite-sex relations  has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on todays social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in todays majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity, I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obamas address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times  a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether theyre marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. Its a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. Its a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. Its a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. Its why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. Its why we ended, Dont Ask, Dont Tell.  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, weve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, Americas shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome todays news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. Thats always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.  
Thats the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.  
  
Thank you.

"2012-09-08",1347065956,"Because my Republican brother thinks all Democrats are Communists - I'm going to donate my fantasy football buy-in money to re-elect Barack Obama","Usually, when August approaches, Ill ""invest"" $150 dollars that Ill inevitably never see again. See, Im a jinx. The albatross. The grand pessimist. Everyones Debbie Downer. The guy who still uses a blackberry and Hotmail. Im the guy scared of the swine flu, gonorrhea, a resurgence of SARS, asthma, third-hand smoke, anemia, scabies, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, brain aneurysms, West Nile virus, blindness, obesity, diabetes, MSG, adult acne  to name a few.
But when I turned 30 this year, on August 13th, I got my yearly fantasy football invite. Last year, I was the runner up  which is Gods yearly routine to remind me that I always deserve a ribbon for participation. And, while Im no religious zealot, I believe God threw his weight into my fantasy football league and injured Tony Romo during my championship game, on the third snap of the game, nonetheless  ruining my chances of victory. Or Gratification. Or Happiness.  

And while many people abhor turning 30, I didnt. I was a failure the day before I turned 30  so naturally, being a failure a day later when I actually turned 30 didnt feel any differently. But the day I got my fantasy football invite  suddenly, I felt alive. My allergies (all 32 of them) dissipated. The sun seemed friendlier  not like a symbol of melanoma. I had swag. I had confidence. I was& Content.

So I excitedly accepted my fantasy football invite and registered my team name  ""The Bad News Baers."" I was already envisioning some of the jive I could throw down after I drafted Calvin Johnson for the fourth year in a row (my longest relationship ever.) It was going to be glorious. Incredible. Life changing. My moment in the sun without sunblock.  I would finally win a fantasy football championship and stop being applauded for ""trying.""

I was going to ruin everyones Sunday when I trampled his or her team. And Id remind them of said trampling on Monday, and Tuesday, and most likely Wednesday.

But then something happened.  My brother called me to wish me a happy birthday. And with that, we got into our usual political discourse. And five minutes after beginning our conversation with a happy birthday, he accused me of idolizing the values of Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx.

Which made me think about the good old days. Before Sarah Palin. Before Eric Bolling. Before Michelle Malkin. And before the Tea Party& When I could have a civil discussion over politics with someone who doesnt share any of my political ideology. Today, they say I support Communism.

And while Id love to blame Sarah Palin, Eric Bolling or Sean Hannity  all who spew hatred and barefaced disrespect toward our President  they are just a few phony entertainers trying to make a Republican dollar out of our Democratic Euros. 

Its Republican strategist Steve Schmidt who created this hullabaloo. 

Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats in Congress were all just aspiring plutocrats interested in lining their own pockets. They were greedy. But we knew this. We werent stupid. But not today.

Today, the Tea Party is the Frankenstein Schmidt created. And he should feel guilty. He was so desperate to win the Presidency for McCain - he put someone who wasnt qualified, let alone bright, on the ticket for Vice President. In his next life, Steve Schmidt should be reincarnated as a Transvaginal Ultrasound wand in a liberal-friendly county Planned Parenthood. 

But I bet he didnt expect this decision would have such a bombastic effect on the country after their losing bid for the Presidency. Most likely, Schmidt thought Palin would go back to Wasilla and say funny things about Putin rearing his head into Alaska, or nuclear weapontry, or Africa being a state, or death panels, or refudiating the media  anything that is factually incorrect, or words not found in a dictionary.

But she didn't go away. She grew. She got bigger. She developed a following.

Her Tea Party has compared President Obama to Hitler. Palin herself has accused our President of palling around with terrorists. A socialist. A man of no valor. And that's only a few. The list goes on. Donald Trump and his birther fiasco. Although in fairness, Trump invented Trump Vodka, Celebrity Apprentice and eats pizza with a fork (which is a kind of a foreign thing to do, Donald Trump.) Arizona Governor Jan Brewer pointing her finger into the face of our President. Kansas House Speaker reciting a bible verse calling for President Obama to be killed. Newt Gingrich referring to our President as the most successful food stamp President of all time and his Kenyan anti-colonial behavior. Senator Mitch McConnell publicly announcing his number one priority was making sure the President wasnt re-elected. Congressman Joe Wilson screaming out you lie during the Presidents State of the Union address. Speaker John Boehner refusing the Presidents date to speak to a joint session on jobs. Allen West saying President Obama creates economic slaves. Michele Bachmann connecting the Swine Flu to Obama. And the list goes on and on and on.

And even worse  Mitt Romney, who is a moderate at heart, has turned on Yoda, cutting every sensible bone off his body with his red lightsaber and embraced the dark side  all to appease Darth Vader and his cronies - Fox News and their impressionable disciples.

Which brings me back to my point. To them, Im a Communist. Why?

Because I want women to be left alone. Because I want to drink clean water. Because I want the rich to pay a little more in taxes. Because I believe that everyone should be entitled to healthcare. Because I believe in gay marriage. Because I believe in climate change. Because I believe in amnesty for illegal immigrants who were taken to the United States through no fault of their own. Because I believe in free and fair elections. Because I believe in human rights. Because I dont care about religion  but believe everyones religious values should be respected. Because I believe in equal pay for women. Because I believe abortion should be left up to a woman. Because I believe in stricter gun laws. Because I believe in affirmative action. And because I dont believe every conflict needs to be settled by war.

&So that makes me a Marxist?

But then there's the irony when a Republican compares me to a murderer like Joseph Stalin& When Im the one who doesnt want to fight a war and Dick Cheney, Halliburton and countless Republican Senators and Representatives make money off war.  

Which brings me back to my point - fantasy football. I will not play fantasy football this year, but rather  I will donate the $150 to the Presidents re-election campaign. And while I know $150 wont change anything  especially with Citizens United, Im hoping more people like me wont splurge on something this year and spend it on someone who will make your future brighter. Someone who will continue to clean up this mess caused by the Republicans. Someone who will fight for the middle class. Someone who doesnt care who you marry. Someone who doesn't want to utter the words - Transvaginal Ultrasound.  And someone who wants everyone to have affordable healthcare.   

That isnt Mitt Romney. He has now donned the Darth Vader armor  paid for by the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson and the like. And if Mitt Romney cant stand up to leaders of his own party now  imagine what kind of puppet hed become if elected President of the United States.

And Remember, President Obama set forth the greenlight for the Osama Bin Laden mission while embarrassing Donald Trump during the White House Correspondents Dinner  killing Trumps dignity and credibility, and icing Bin Laden, too.

Mitt Romney would need to see internal polling before making such a decision. Or change his mind half way through the mission. Or just promise to repeal ObamaCare. 

Its not Communism. Its not about fantasy football. Its just common sense. ","politics",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/zj9r9/because_my_republican_brother_thinks_all/"

Finally someone has the guts to say what so many of the rest of us have been thinking....

 
BUCHANAN TO OBAMA

Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:

First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.

Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.

We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???

Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown , and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids.? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?

Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself?

As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?

Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?

We have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev. Al about Tawana Brawley, the Duke rape case and Jena . And all turned out to be hoaxes. But about the epidemic of black assaults on whites that are real, we hear nothing.

Sorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago.
We are a Christian Nation even if Mr. Obama says we are not.","politics",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9b1by/so_my_conservative_grandfather_forwarded_this/"

"2019-11-20",1574265491,"Megathread: Sondland testifies Trump ordered Ukraine quid pro quo through Giuliani","U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday that there was a quid pro quo between Ukraine conducting politically motivated investigations and getting a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sondland said the connection between these two issues was widely known throughout the administration. ""I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,"" Sondland said in his opening statement. He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on ""the presidents orders,"" confirming Trumps active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.

"2010-10-25",1287991881,"6 out of 10 propositions on my Arizona Ballot are outright lies, cleverly written to deceive voters.","There is a disturbing trend among these propositions:

1) They are written on the ballot in a style that hides their real effects. 

2) Some will permanently take away powers from the voters. 

3) The sponsors reference false threats and fears that do not really exist.

4) They attack vulnerable groups. 

5) They are sponsored by outside groups who want to gain a foothold for a cause, not improve AZ.


**Prop 107: Ending 'discrimination' by banning efforts to close racial education gaps** 

*What the ballot says:* This will make racial discrimination a state crime.

*Real effect:* Will end scholarships, classes and early-start programs designed to inform hispanics/natives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* AZ doesn't have affirmative action! Just specialized education programs.

*Outside sponsorship:* Sponsored almost entirely by Colorado group that attacks affirmative action all around the country.


**Prop 109: Tweek the AZ Constitution to take away voter control over wildlife issues**

*What the ballot says:* Make hunting a protected constitutional right regulated by the legislature.

*Real effect:* The voters will be barred from passing popular wildlife initiatives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* There is no threat to hunting rights, and they are already protected.

*Outside sponsorship:* The NRA was the original and by far the largest sponsor.


**Prop 112: Make it even more impossible for citizens to get initiatives on the ballot**

*What the ballot says:* ""A Yes vote will change the initiative filing deadline from 4 months to 6 months prior to election""

*Real effect:* The wording is almost impossible to understand in this proposition. It would shorten the time available to citizens to collect signatures for popular initiatives. There is so little time already that citizens can almost never gather the required amount. This year, the only popular initiative that was able to make it to the AZ ballot is the medical marijuana proposition. This would end choice in establishment favorites such as photo radar.


**Prop 113: Make it prohibitively complicated for groups of workers to unionize**

*What the ballot says:* Protect the workers' right to a secret ballot.

*Real effect:* Forces unions to have the most complicated form of initiation even though less complicated forms are generally considered adequate and fair.

*Baseless fear mongering:* The worker's right to privacy is not threatened currently, and unions are vehemently against this possible new, expensive requirement.

*Outside sponsorship:* Anti-union front groups. http://www.progressivestates.org/node/22564


**Prop 301: Take all the money from the Land Conservation Fund with no future repayment**

**Prop 302: Take all the money from the Early Childhood Development Fund with no future repayment** 

*What the ballot says:* Please help move the balance of these funds into the general fund.

*Real effects and motivation:*
Jan Brewer always says that she has balanced the budget. In reality, she meant that the budget is balanced if voters approve her two propositions, 301 &amp; 302. Otherwise an 800 million dollar shortfall/deficit remains. These two propositions will take money out of funds to help children. These funds were created by voters and thus need voter approval to be raided. Brewer doesn't want new taxes, except this hidden tax on POOR CHILDREN.

**Edit:** Thank you for your comments. I want to point out that there are other propositions that I do not like. These are clearly worded, however, and therefore I avoided posting them in this submission. 

I elaborate elsewhere in the comments, but here is a good alternative source provided by SporkofThor:
http://race.change.org/blog/view/will_arizona_voters_roll_back_racial_progress_with_prop_107

Whether you agree with affirmative action or not, the writers of Prop. 107 should be more honest and portray their intent truly on the ballot.

In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the high courts six-justice conservative majority found that the universities discriminated against white and Asian American applicants by using race-conscious policies that benefited applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, saying the Harvard and UNC admissions programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today. he wrote.

The three liberal justices dissented; with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the ruling closes the door of opportunity that the Courts precedents helped open to young students of every race.

The decision is expected to upend universities decadeslong efforts to create racially diverse campuses. Lets discuss what this means and [what comes next](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/29/school-admissions-after-scotus-affirmative-action-00104293)  ask us anything.

And it was all a Republican plan, fantasized by Nixon, and realized by Reagan.","[The New Jim Crow] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow#Chapter_1:_The_Rebirth_of_Caste)

&gt;The [1970s] saw a number of issues, such as civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, busing and welfare (conservatives indirectly suggested that the blacks were refusing to work, because they preferred to live off government hand-outs) developing into intense controversies. Nixon declared illicit drugs a ""public enemy number one"" and declared a ""war on drugs"", although no specific drug enforcement policy was yet envisioned and no right wing race and social policy consensus had yet emerged.

&gt;The conservative revolution with the political focus in the Republican Party reached its mature stage when Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980. Reagan issued many implicit, but formally race-neutral appeals concerning crime, welfare, taxes and state rights and his candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by frustrated and disaffected whites; 22% of all Democrats ended up voting for him. Once elected, Reagan proceeded to fulfill his promise of enhancing the federal government's role in combating crime, which at first seemed to be no easy task, since street crime had traditionally been the area of jurisdiction and responsibility of state and local authorities. But the determination was there and the expansion of federal authority posed no difficulty for conservative politicians in this case.

&gt;The Justice Department first announced the cutting in half of the personnel assigned to the prosecution of white-collar crimes and switching its emphasis to street crime, especially the enforcement of illegal drug policies. In October 1982, President Reagan officially declared his administration's ""War on Drugs"", a political move intended to facilitate the implementation of the white right wing's informal race policies that were then assuming a definitive shape, rather than to address the (quite limited at that time) public concern about drugs.","politics",136,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ydma3/the_war_on_drugs_costs_billions_has_created_a/"

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more uniform and effective the prior patchwork of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the [i]nitial registration requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement. §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the [i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b). The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNAs enactment (pre-Act offenders), the Attorney General
shall have the authority to specify the applicability of SORNAs
registration requirements and to prescribe rules for [their] registration. §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNAs registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District
Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to specify the applicability of SORNAs registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders. 

&gt;**Held: The judgment is affirmed.**

I am not the only voter disaffected with the Clintons dishonest and divisive nature. {[1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronda-lee/i-cant-vote-for-hillary_b_9119658.html)}  

Hillary's lip service and pandering [has been blatant this entire campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3iBb1gvehI).  

[There are plenty of skeletons in Hillary's closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypl1MYuKDY); what is posted below is a representative sample.  Hillary's history is enough to scare most people that put time in to learn about her.  [Hillary's Wall St connections and donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46qbn3/here_are_all_of_hillary_clintons_wall_street/), the tens of millions the Clintons made in ""speaking fees"" (legalized bribery), and her refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches are equally deplorable. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46mr9r/sanders_accepts_clintons_challenge_on_wall_street/d06l7ty)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47y0fr/everyone_wants_to_know_what_was_in_hillary/)}

The Clintons have a pretty disgusting history of pathological lying, dishonesty, manipulation, corruption, vindictive behavior, and dirty tricks including smearing honest credible people through [whisper campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_campaign).
They also don't mind sending out supporters and surrogates to do their dirty work.  

One of the most egregious violations so far this election involves Clinton ties to MSNBC host Chris Matthews and MSNBC contributor/WAPO editor Jonathan Capehart.

There are other documented accounts of major media organizations manipulating coverage and protecting Hillary. {[1](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/new_york_times_busted_for_anti_bernie_bias_the_iconic_clinton_endorsing_newspaper_slyly_edits_article_to_smear_sanders/)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47z286/memetics_manipulation_and_suppression_how_cnn/)}{[3](http://m.dailykos.com/stories/1499966)}{[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ag1cr/msnbcs_chris_matthews_faces_call_to_suspend_show/d109wmv)}{[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlC31eFTc0)}

Questions remain if Hillary will be indicted by the FBI for hosting a private server that exposed classified information to the internet.  Hillary's server was setup to circumvent archival requirements of the Federal Records Act and FOIA requests.  The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for pay-to-play access involving Hillary's DoS actions in exchange for ""donations.""  {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kt9u/whichhillary_twitter_trend_calls_out_clinton_for/d0dv5mh?context=1)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary is currently under six investigations, but the FBI and OIG investigations are the most severe.  

And if that isn't enough ..

[Hillary displays traits commonly attributed with APD - Psychopathy](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46lyqu/hillary_clinton_i_dont_believe_i_have_ever_lied/d06mmjb).

For the **non-lazy**,

Start with the statements from the IC IG.

Then read ""Hillary's disingenuous claim that nothing was marked ""classified.""

It's also important to point out that the FBI email investigation is completely separate from a secondary FBI investigation into pay-to-play abuses that involve donations to The Clinton Foundation preceding/following actions by Hillary during her time as Secretary of State. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary and her Chief-of-Staff Cheryl Mills [did not sign OF-109 forms upon leaving State](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/16/3037241/).  This was deliberate.

&gt; That statement would have required her to affirm that she had returned all classified materials in her possession.

**Re: Jonathan Capehart (WAPO/MSNBC) smears Sanders civil rights record**  
**Re: Chris Matthews bias and conflict of interest**  

http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-jonathan-capehart-saga-or-why-progressives-hav.html

...

This is an example of the incestuous relationship between ""journalists"" and politicians.

The Clintons have [a history of using journalists to push stories](http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058).   On Thursday Feb. 11, 2016, Capehart published [an editorial in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/) and [sent out tweets](http://archive.is/BCLLM) [check the summaries] smearing Sanders civil rights record.  Capehart repeated the smear claims during a post democratic debate interview [on a special edition of Hardball on MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AshSzj0F-nU) (Feb 11).  

It should be noted that the spouse of MSNBC's Chris Matthews is [Kathleen Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Matthews) formerly of Marriott International, [who worked closely with the Clinton Foundation for four years to open a Marriott hotel in Haiti](http://news.marriott.com/2015/05/kathleen-matthews-departs-marriott-international-to-pursue-new-opportunity.html).  Kathleen Matthews, funded by Hillary donors and friends {[1](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/14/media/chris-matthews-kathleen-matthews/)}{[2](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/chris-matthewss-hardball-guests-have-given-79050-to-his-wife-kathleens-congressional-campaign/)}{[3](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/09/hillary-donors-helping-chris-matthews-wife-into-congress/)}{[4](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/13/ten-thousand-demand-chris-matthews-suspension-msnbc-silent/)}, is running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Maryland's 8th congressional district..  

Watch these vids {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuMnN4wvBY)}{[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqjp8dYOvu0)}{[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMdeXrfkmU)}, Chris Matthews is heavily biased.

This explains how Capehart's smears went unchallenged. A prominent progressive site has called for MSNBC to suspend Chris Matthews for continued shilling and bias. [link removed - it violates the rules?]

Danny Lyon the original photographer, heard of the smears and [posted additional negatives to his blog](https://dektol.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/more-bernie-civil-rights-photos-found) proving the man [in the original photo](https://dektol.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-29-at-6-49-15-pm.png) was Sanders.  On Friday Feb 12, Capeheart repeated his claims live [on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RDTOUJHY). 

Capehart failed to disclose a direct conflict of interest acknowledging [his long term romantic relationship with long time Clinton staffer Nick Schmit](http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-jonathan-capehart-and-nick-schmits-house) and refuses to print a retraction or apologize. It's a pretty transparent hit piece attempting to discredit Sanders civil rights record in the lead up to the South Carolina primary on Feb 27.

To maintain ethical integrity and standards of a news outlet and as a journalist you are supposed to disclose conflicts or avoid them entirely. 

Schmit [has worked for the Clintons in various capacities since 2004-2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20160215055916/https://twitter.com/McSquirmishes/status/699032420029337601) as an employee of the Clinton Foundation, staff on Hillary's 2008 campaign, and subsequently moved to the US State Department in 2009 under Hillary where he has remained as a GS-14 Schedule C appointment [maybe his job is in jeopardy next year if Clinton doesn't win].

Shortly after Capehart's smear campaign, the twitter account [@FauxJCapehart](https://twitter.com/FauxJCapehart/with_replies) appeared. [[archived](http://archive.is/XrGMW)] 

As outrageous and disturbing as Capehart's actions are, the conversations initiated by troll account @FauxJCapehart is probably one of the most hilarious things to come from this election cycle.

**Re: Dolores Huerta: Sanders supporters chanted ""English only!""** {debunked}

**Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHDo-uEIi4

Huerta is a surrogate of Hillary Clinton.  She is a well known hispanic political activist and founder of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. When Clinton routinely mentions support from the UFW that support is solidified by her personal and financial relationship with Dolores.

Huerta made [accusations against Obama in 2008](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/21/1488535/-Dolores-Huerta-did-the-same-thing-to-Obama-in-2008) and [received a $100,000 donation from the Clinton Foundation in 2010](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/300/300048438/300048438_201012_990PF.pdf). [page 33]

After the Nevada Caucus, Dolores Huerta and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera claimed supporters of Bernie Sanders chanted ""English only."" {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1l5SHR4GvE)}{[2](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094857/https://twitter.com/DoloresHuerta/status/701184235315400705)}{[3](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094846/https://twitter.com/AmericaFerrera/status/701166307387928577)} 

[This is false](http://www.snopes.com/sanders-english-only-huerta/).  

A person in the audience noted that people only spoke Spanish and needed a translator.  Precinct Chair Raymond Buckley asked if there was a translator in the audience. Buckley then stated, ""First person on the stage that speaks Spanish gets to do it."" Hillary's supporters shouted ""Dolores."" Dolores walked up to the stage.  People in the audience objected. ""no!"" ""neutral!"" ""she's a surrogate!""  Nevada Caucus Guidelines prevent observers and surrogates from speaking during the Caucus proceeding.  Rightfully, people in the audience were concerned that Huerta, a Clinton surrogate, might attempt to instruct Spanish speakers to group toward Clinton's area.  Precinct Chair Buckley noted the conflict and stated ""we are going forward English only.""  Buckley followed with the instructions, ""if somebody next to you is not English speaking please make sure you are next to them so you can translate as quickly as possible.""

**Re: Obama Boys 2008 vs Bernie Bros 2016**

This attack was first run by Clinton supporters against Obama in 2008, in an attempt to disparage the candidate and label their supporters as sexist mysoginists with racist connotations.{[1](http://dailykos.com/stories/2016/2/8/1481627/-WOW-Before-the-sexist-Bernie-Bro-Clinton-supporters-created-the-sexist-Obama-boy-No-seriously)}{[2](http://www.salon.com/2008/04/14/obama_supporters/)}

""Bernie Bros"" is a demeaning categorization for male Sanders supporters first penned in a Fall 2015 OP-ED. The BernieBros myth was further pushed into the sexist misogynist realm by Clinton supporters Emily Nussbaum and Emily Cahn.  Emily Nussbaum is a blogger/TV critic for ""The New Yorker"" and [a self-professed Clinton supporter](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216033537/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/691834775343087616); her father [is attorney Bernard Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_W._Nussbaum), former white house counsel for Bill Clinton.

Emily Nussbaum [was labeled ""a psycho""](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040007/https://twitter.com/TJMitchJohnson/status/691839468710535168) by a single self-described Tea Party Trump supporter with a fake twitter account [@RepStevenSmith](https://twitter.com/RepStevenSmith). {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8Q0RYWGqM)}{[2](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/01/31/greenwald-anti-sanders-bernie-bro-articles-based-on-parody-account/)}{[3](http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/199111-fake-congressman-fools-people-on-twitter)}. [@RussPMguy](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040448/https://twitter.com/RussPMguy) is also a Trump supporter.

Emily [falsely attributed this troll attack](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216034042/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/693452999071526912) to Bernie supporters.
Clinton supporter Emily Cahn [repeated Nussbaum's account, falsely blaming Sanders supporters](http://mashable.com/2016/01/29/bernie-sanders-berniebros/).

""Bernie Bros"" does not exist, it was a troll.  But that isn't stopping the Clinton campaign from repeating the myth like they did in 2008 against Obama.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court conducted a proper holistic analysis of the majority-minority Virginia House of Delegates districts under the prior decision in this case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, even though it ignored a host of evidence, including the overwhelming majority of district lines, which were carried over unchanged from the prior map; the geographic location of population disparities, which imposed severe redistricting constraints and directly impacted which voters were moved into and out of the majority-minority districts; and the degree of constraint the Houses Voting Rights Act compliance goals imposed in implementation, which was minimal; (2) whether the Bethune-Hill predominance test is satisfied merely by a lengthy description of ordinary Voting Rights Act compliance measures; (3) whether the district court erred in relying on expert analysis it previously rejected as unreliable and irrelevant and expert analysis that lacked any objective or coherent methodology; (4) whether the district court committed clear error in ignoring the entirety of the houses evidentiary presentation under the guise of credibility determinations unsupported by the record and predicated on expert testimony that should not have been credited or even admitted; (5) whether Virginias choice to draw 11 safe majority-minority districts of around or above 55 percent black voting-age population (BVAP) was narrowly tailored in light of the discretion the Voting Rights Act afforded covered jurisdictions to choose to create a certain number of safe districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice, under Georgia v. Ashcroft, or the requirement the Voting Rights Act, as amended, imposed on covered jurisdictions to prove the absence of racially polarized voting to justify BVAP reductions towards or below 50 percent BVAP; (6) whether the district court erred in ignoring the district-specific evidence before the house in 2011 justifying safe districts at or above 55 percent BVAP; and (7) whether appellants have standing to bring this appeal.

**Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in rejecting the Supreme Courts state actor tests and instead creating a per se rule that private operators of public access channels are state actors subject to constitutional liability; and (2) whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in holdingcontrary to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 6th and District of Columbia Circuitsthat private entities operating public access television stations are state actors for constitutional purposes where the state has no control over the private entitys board or operations.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

Orders begin at 9:30am EST, with the possibility of opinions at 10:00am EST.

There are **8** pending cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**
&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**
&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule [Auer v. Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auer_v._Robbins) and [Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/325/410/), which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

The Federal Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

###UPDATES:

**US v. Haymond**

The 10th Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

[Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1672_5hek.pdf)

The court holds that a federal law requiring a defendant who is registered as a sex offender to return to prison for at least five years if a federal judge finds that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release is unconstitutional.

* * * * * * * * * *

**Tennessee Wine &amp; Spirits vs. Thomas**

It's also on [my blog](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=110).

18 February 2011

Dr. Culver and Ms. Heipp,

I must confess to expressing a falsehood recently. When I learned that a collective day of action was being planned for Thursday 17 February, I logged into the AESOP system to register my absence. I am woefully ignorant about reimbursable days and the like, so I did not attempt to request a Leave Without Stated Reason (as some of my colleagues did). I saw no option for Protest Against Illegitimate Attempt to Revoke Fundamental Rights by State Legislature, so instead I stated that the reason was Illness. But I was not sick.

I could pretend that I really was sick yesterday. Given my history of chronic insomnia (which, I am learning, is woefully common among my colleagues) and resulting illness, I probably could obtain a note from my doctor testifying to a legitimate absence. But I will not do this, because I have too much respect for the intelligence of SPHS and SPASD administrators.

Yesterday I went to the Wisconsin State Capitol building to protest against Governor Scott Walkers budget proposal, which would (among other things) abolish the right of state workers to collectively bargain. I went because I consider this proposal a fundamental violation of our rights and dignity as hard-working people. **As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1937: The right to bargain collectively is at the bottom of social justice for the worker, as well as the sensible conduct of business affairs. The denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy.**

I did not make this decision lightly. As my students and colleagues will affirm, I approach the act of teaching with a passion and reverence usually associated with monastic devotion. Despite the elimination of funding for the SPHS Go Club last year, I continue to offer practice sessions and after-school meetings regularly, without pay. I worked tirelessly to develop and implement the new Interdisciplinary Poetics course several years ago, with very positive results. And, like all of my colleagues, I spend countless hours outside of the regular contract day grading papers and preparing for upcoming classes.

Teaching is not simply a job for me. I need contact with young people. I need to tell them about how writing liberates, about the value of literature, about why East Timor matters. I need to explain to them (loudly) why *Transformers* is a bad movie. I need to tell them silly jokes and remind them that they are glorious manifestations of their ancestors dreams.

I will understand if my pay for Thursday is withheld. Fortunately I have no dependent children or significant debt which compels me to scrape and save each penny that I receive. I also understand that my AESOP prevarication was an affront to the trust between employer and employee. I understand that I must now work to rebuild that trust. (Though I hope the many trust deposits I have made during the past eight years will help.)

However, I ask for mercy as the school and district consider disciplinary action. Had this day of protest been concerned with mere dollars, I would have certainly been in front of my classroom as always. As my students are reading right now in Lorraine Hansberrys play *A Raisin in the Sun*, Mama tells her son Walter that money is not life. Once upon a time, she says, freedom used to be life.

It was in the spirit of freedom and our rights as people that I made the difficult decision to abandon my position as educator for one day. I humbly apologize to the parents and families that had to scramble for supervision or daycare when the doors of SPHS were suddenly closed. I know that my actions have made the lives of other people more difficult, and I ask for their understanding.

But as the old saying goes, an injustice to one is an injustice to all. I believe that we who protested at the state capitol were doing so not only for ourselves  nor for public employees  but for all working people in our state, in our nation. As my sign at the protest said: The state could also save money by abolishing our right to vote, right? But this would be unfair. I expect you would protest if the government tried to abolish this right of yours.

And I would be right beside you.

(TLDR: You cannot possibly hope to understand the vital complexities of our struggle if you're not willing to read more. Please stop looking for shortcuts.)","politics",190,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/foi8h/from_a_wisconsin_teacher_why_i_skipped_school_on/"

Update: Finishing up edits on a story  will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

**New Mexico**

Trump v. Secretary of State -- Active Case -- This case was filed as the Electoral College is voting and it seeks to enjoin New Mexico's electors from certifying the election/voting in the EC. It doesn't make any novel argument that hasn't been shot down by other courts. Also filing a lawsuit like this on the day the EC votes is not timely, to say the least. They also want the court to remand the case to a place it's never been: the state legislature. The state legislature is controlled by democrats. 

I'm including it up here because it's an actual Trump case and not one of his allies. Also they might get sanctioned for this. There's no purpose in filing this lawsuit except to be vexatious to a state that didn't vote for Trump and to use the court as a fundraising tool.

**Texas**

Texas v. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Wisconsin -- Cert. Denied -- [Texas filed for a Preliminary Injunction to flip the election.](https://www.scribd.com/document/487348461/TX-v-State-Mpi-2020-12-07-Final#from_embed). [Trump Intervened](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O155/163234/20201209155327055_No.%2022O155%20Original%20Motion%20to%20Intervene.pdf) Texas argues they have standing because the Vice President would be Kamala Harris, and the Constitution requires equal suffrage in the Senate. (This reads like a joke, but it's not. Texas believes that their preferred candidate not winning an election is an injury to the state. Their standing argument is that they don't like elections, basically.) Texas claims deadlines are unconstitutional. They also make a Frankenstein's monster of an argument that cobbles together claims already shot down in the other 50+ lawsuits Trump and his allies have lost in the courts challenging election protocols. [I wrote some stuff about it here in Legalish](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/legalish-election-litigation-update-rudys-big-day-out-brian-lynch/?trackingId=hqcWi%2BJFRKWkD32dwp1Mtw%3D%3D. 

Some spicy flavor notes to this glass of awful: the solicitor general of Texas is conspicuously absent. He's the designated SCOTUS attorney for the state. The person running it is Attorney General Paxton, a guy that's facing a criminal indictment from a grand jury and faced recent allegations of bribery. 

Edit: its dead. Dismissed on standing. Alito and Thomas dissented. Would have heard the case but denied relief.

**Pennsylvania** 

*[Donald J Trump v. Boockvar](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/2020-11-09-complaint-as-filed.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2220IfyKv6yE_3tG60ZtpPwYXU5oev6aar2vpBxA8ragcUw5tiaYJIi-E)* -- [dismissed with prejudice](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.202.0_1.pdf)  Trump campaign has asked the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to order the governor of Pennsylvania not to certify election results. The request stems from several complaints that vote-by-mail ballots were permitted to be corrected in some counties but not othersin other words, nothing that could possibly justify stopping the Secretary of State and Governor from certifying the results. 

This is the first serious attempt at litigation but the relief sought is a heavy ask which is to not allow PA to have an election this year.

[In Re: Canvassing Observation
Appeal of: City of Philadelphia Board of Elections](https://ujsportal.pacourts.us/DocketSheets/AppellateCourtReport.ashx?docketNumber=30+EAP+2020&amp;dnh=J0Ej52DFuhKD8zIZIJ5LMw%3d%3d) --[ Appellate court's decision is reversed. Trial court's order denying Trump campaign relief is reinstated; namely, the observation distance rules were fine.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20407623/pa-supreme-court-decision-on-election-observers.pdf)  --  [Thank you /u/OrangeInnards!]


In this case, the County of Philadelphia Board of Electors is appealing a decision about the distance observers can be to the ballot counters. An appellate court reversed a trial court saying protocols for the distance between observers and counters were fine. The County seems to want their initial protocols affirmed by the State Supreme Court even if the issue is moot. [Thank you /u/_Doctor_Teeth_ for contributing!]

[Update](https://www.dailywire.com/news/gop-win-in-pa-judge-tosses-thousands-of-ballots-without-dates-reversing-lower-court-ruling): ""2,349 absentee ballots in Allegheny County where the voter didnt date their declaration are invalid, reversing a lower court judge.""

*Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Boockvar, 20-542; Scarnati v. Pennsylvania Democratic Party, 20-574* -- Active case -- This is the case about the 4,900 or so ballots received by mail in Pennsylvania between 8 p.m. November 3 and November 6, but postmarked by Election Day. These 4,900 or so ballots are not enough to make up Trumps 45,000 vote deficit even if they all were counted his way. In any event, Republicans are asking for the opposite relief: they want these ballots not to count. Case is interesting pretty much exclusively because SCOTUS could touch it but it's doubtful they will because the outcome wouldn't affect anything.

The court dismissed a motion for TRO on lack of standing but didn't dismiss the entire lawsuit for lack of standing. Alleged is that the defendants unilaterally changed election procedures specifically with regard to absentee ballots (including curing,) improperly.  The suit asks to exclude the absentee ballots from the GA tabulation and certification, and to proscribe any certification which includes said absentee ballots.

[Brooks v. Mahoney](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gasd.82897/gov.uscourts.gasd.82897.1.0.pdf) -- Active case -- Republican voters submitted a host of issues about ballots and voting issues. E.g., voters not receiving requested ballots and having to use a provisional instead or ballot counters counting ballots in secret after 10:30 pm at State Farm Arena. Relief requested is to invalidate the election results in Atlanta and some of the state's most populous suburbs. 

 In Re: Enforcement of Election Laws and Securing Ballots Cast or Received after 7:00pm on November 3, 2020, SPCV20-00982 -- Dismissed -- A Republican poll watcher went to the bathroom. When he got back 53 ballots had been processed while he was taking his evening constitutional. At an evidentiary hearing the case fell tp pieces. The relief sought wouldn't have changed the outcome anyway. Case dismissed.

[Donald J Trump v. Hobbs](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/verified-complaint-with-attachments.pdf) -- Dismissed -- Plaintiffs realized relief requested would not flip the outcome of the election and voluntarily dismissed -- This is a case about overvoting in Maricopa County. This is basically Sharpiegate but repackaged and even includes declarations from people complaining about Sharpies. Trump's attorneys allege that poll workers either pushed or induced voters to push a green button to override warnings about overvoting. The relief sought mirrors the process for overvotes in the AZ Elections Manual (which has the weight of law in AZ). The relief sought will not change the outcome.

[Costantino v Detroit](https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Complaint-Costantino-FINAL-With-Exhibits.pdf) [Credit /u/spartangrrl78! Thank you for contributing!] -- Dismissed -- plaintiffs interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible --



https://www.greatlakesjc.org/wp-content/uploads/Motion-for-TRO-Brief-Order-Costantino.pdf

Of note: The law firm that is handling this is the same who represented the barber out of mid-Michigan who didn't want to follow Whitmer's stay at home order last spring and stayed open and as a result, the guy became a cult hero. 

Anyway, 3 out of the 5 affiants are political activists for the GOP. That isn't to say that means that's unusual, given that they were GOP poll watchers/advisers, But it makes you question why they all volunteered at the Detroit precinct when none of them live in Detroit. 

Patrick Colbeck ran for the gubernatorial GOP nomination in 2018 and had single-digit support, made a bunch of racist and xenophobic attacks against Abdul el Sayed and is generally not someone that I would think acts in good faith.

One of them is an attorney who seems to be a conservative activist.

Another is a former chair of a local GOP.

Another has in his LinkedIn profile that he is literally a 'political activist.'

I'm not saying that makes these guys less credible, I'm just saying that it seems like all of them signed up to work at the polls with an agenda. Its even obvious from their affidavits that they were just getting in the way and being obnoxious, or misunderstood the entire process and are trying to frame it in an underhanded way. (AKA Colbeck climbing under desks to see if a modem was connected for literally no reason, the other guy insinuating that there was something underhanded about a box of ballots arriving in a mail bin).

[Donald Trump v Secretary of State](https://www.wilx.com/2020/11/09/trump-campaign-files-appeal-on-vote-counting-ruling/) -- Appealed -- Case was dismissed at the trial court because the relief sought was moot. Trump's attorneys want access to video surveillance of voting drop off spots through the appeal anyway. They failed to file about 8 different documents though so they need to cure defects in filing before proceeding.

[*Stokke cases*](https://lawandcrime.com/2020-election/republican-claims-of-voting-irregularities-in-nevada-flopped-before-a-federal-judge/) -- Dismissed -- An elderly woman sent in a ballot that was verified and received. She had an issue with that. Was offered the ability to sign an affidavit confirming her vote. Case dismissed in state court.

[Trump Electors v. Biden Electors](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/nov-17-doc-2.pdf) -- Active case -- Trump electors demand that Trump be announced the winner or that no one be certified the winner. The complaint seems to focus on GOTV efforts by democrats being unfair somehow but doesn't specify why. They make some noise about voting machines not functioning properly but concede they don't have evidence this would affect the outcome (""evidence will show..."" but they don't have anything in the complaint) and then construe this to be an equal protection issue because machine verification of signatures is different than visually checking them. (Note: it's kind of facially ridiculous to think that a computer would have a more difficult time than a human verifying signatures. ) Regardless of the merits the ask is gigantic here.

**Vance v. Ball State**

* *Facts of the Case:* 
Maetta Vance began working for University Dining Services at Ball State University in 1989 as a substitute server. She was the only African-American working in the department. Vance submitted a complaint to the University when a coworker used a racial epithet directed at her and African-American students at the University. The University issued the coworker a written warning, but following a series of incidents that resulted in Vance reporting that she felt unsafe in her workplace, the University investigated but found no basis for action. In 2006, Vance sued Ball State University in federal district court for lessening her work duties and ability to work overtime, forcing her to work through her breaks, and unjustly disciplining her. After filing the suit, Vance claimed her work environment continued to worsen, but the Universitys investigations did not yield enough evidence to discipline anyone. The University moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion and held that there was not enough evidence to prove a hostile work environment and that the University was not liable for the actions of individual coworkers. Vance appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the lower court

* *Question:* Can a coworker who is vested with the authority to oversee the daily work of another worker be considered a supervisor for the purpose of determining employer liability for harassment?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_11_556)


* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome:* A substantial amount of time in oral argument was spent dealing with the subject of the record and the actual facts in the case. This troubled some justices especially Scalia. Substantial time was also spent in oral argument comparing/contrasting Vance to a previous case on employment law. This case was [Faragher v. City of Boca Raton](http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1997/1997_97_282). In a very messy and quick summary a supervising lifeguard was using his position of power and authority to hedge and harass a lower employee. In this case threatening/making her clean toilets unless she 'dated' him. the Court held that an employer is vicariously liable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for actionable discrimination caused by a supervisor. The Court also held that such liability is subject to an affirmative defense looking to the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of the plaintiff victim. ""The City had entirely failed to disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of supervisors like [Faragher's],"" wrote Justice Souter, ""[u]nder such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the City could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct."" The comparison to this case is a little difficult for Vance. First, because in Faragher the supervisor role was readily explicit. In the case of Vance it was not. The Justices debated the record and even semantic interpretations of what it meant to be supervisor. Is the role of a supervisor dependent on the ability to affect the day to day work of said employee? Here are a couple of hypotheticals that the Justices spent some time on. A messy paraphrasing of CJ Roberts hypothetical in oral arguments: Let's say an employee can control the music in work environment and uses your distain of country in some hegemonic manner? Should the court hold the employer and thus employee supervisor liable in that case? Also is that person a supervisor because he effects the day to day of your work environment? Breyer had an alternative hypothetical.

The court might decide very narrowly. Ball State will not likely not be seen liable for a worker who really had no supervisory role practically or semantically over Vance. 

*After Thoughts*

* At one point Alito uses the same Roberts music reference but adds Wagner as potential music to abuse employees. Not 100% on this but I am fairly confident you can hear Scalia roaring with laughter at the thought in oral argument. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissented in the original Faragher v. City Boca Raton. Justice Kennedy, Breyer, and Ginsburg did join the majority and remain. 

* Despite Kennedy remaining it seems he might have wavered this time. Alito has not written an opinion in December. He is likely the author in this case. This would not bode well for Vance. My prediction is 5-4 split in favor of the respondent.

**Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl**

* *Facts of the Case:* When the biological mother of Baby Girl became pregnant she did not live with the father and the father did not support the mother financially. The mother sent the father a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. He sent a text back, saying that he would relinquish his rights, though he later testified that he thought he was relinquishing his rights only to the mother. The biological father was a registered member of the Cherokee Nation. The biological mother attempted to verify this status, but spelled the fathers name wrong and misrepresented his birthday in the request, so the Nation could not locate the fathers registration. The mother listed Baby Girls ethnicity as Hispanic instead of Native American on the birth certificate. The mother decided to put Baby Girl up for adoption because she had two other children that she struggled to support. Adoptive Couple, who resided in South Carolina, began adoption proceedings in that state. The Cherokee Nation finally identified the father as a registered member and filed a notice of intervention, stating that Baby Girl was an Indian Child under the Federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). The father stated that he did not consent to the adoption and would seek custody of Baby Girl. After trial, the family court denied Adoptive Couples petition for adoption and granted custody to the biological father. The court held that the biological father was a parent under the ICWA because of his paternity and pursuit of custody as soon as he learned that Baby Girl was being put up for adoption. Adoptive Couple did not follow the procedural directives in the ICWA to obtain the fathers consent prior to initiating adoption proceedings. The Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed.

* *Question:* 
Can a non-custodial parent invoke ICWA to block an adoption voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a non-Indian parent under state law? Does ICWA define parent to include an unwed biological father who has not complied with state law rules to attain legal status as a parent?

[Oral Argument](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_399)

* *Quick Analysis on Oral Argument/Possible Outcome*: So this case is definitely more tricky. The Justices spent a lot of time on the ways of interpreting Congress's original intent in the statute. For example, Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for the petitioner, describes how the original law itself is being perverted beyond its original and beneficial intent. Interestingly, some of the Justices went out of their way to discuss if the ICWA was still relevant. It seems a bit out of scope of the case at hand. Another interesting but maybe legally tangential point of contention concerned the Cherokee status of the baby girl and biological father. The Cherokee nation do not require ""Blood Quantums"" (or certain percentages) to be declared Cherokee. Rather, an individual has to prove a single ancestor from an official list to be considered Cherokee. The father in the case is less than 4% Cherokee and the daughter less than 2%. Alito and CJ Roberts had some trouble with the use of ICWA due the blood quantum dilemma. 

*After Thoughts*

* In an an [interview](http://www.bloomberg.com/video/u-s-supreme-court-justice-scalia-on-reading-law-BPCeR1adQeCiaqtvCSLdGA.html) with Charlie Rose, Scalia commented that the hardest decision that he may have ever made was a very similar case to this one in the 1980s. He had to return a adopted boy from his well-off parents to his biological parents due to ICWA provisions. The boy had lived with his adoptive parents for years. 

* CJ Roberts has two children, both adopted. 

* Lisa Blatt is one of my favorite oral advocates on the Supreme Court. Sometimes there is a lot of rhetorical flourish but her rebuttal in this case cannot be missed: ""And I want you to keep in mind about this case, is your decision is going to apply to the next case and to a apartment in New York City where a tribal member impregnates someone who's African-American or Jewish or Asian Indian, and in that view, even though the father is a completely absentee father, you are rendering these women second-class citizens with inferior rights to direct their reproductive rights and their -- who raises their child.
You are relegating adopted parents to go to the back of the bus and wait in line if they can adopt. And you're basically relegating the child, the child to a piece of property with a sign that says,""Indian, keep off."" ""Do not disturb."" This case is going to affect any interracial adoption of children.

* Radiolab did a [great piece](http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2013/may/30/adoptive-couple-v-baby-girl/) on the case and met the ""Baby Girl.""

* Edit: /u/borkborkbork has some insightful and astute clarifications that were not made perfectly clear before. Also who doesn't love that username? I think every judicial nominee mutters that in their sleep. ""A few clarifications about the facts in the ""Adoptive Couple"" case, because the summary above makes the actions of both birth parents seem different from what they actually were: The text message conversation: Father testified that he did intend to relinquish his rights to the child, but he testified that his relinquishment was based on his assumption that the birth mother would raise the child. The mother spelled the father's name wrong because the father himself uses multiple spellings of his own name on various legal documents, and she guessed incorrectly as to which spelling he had used in his tribal registration. (Dustin/Dusten/Dustan). The baby, while within the legal definition of ""Native American"", is 3/256 Cherokee. The father is not much more than that. The mother is Hispanic. It's an interesting case, because the father had no apparent interest in playing any part in the child's life, or of having the child raised by a Native American, until he discovered that the mother was putting the child up for adoption. Had he been any ethnicity other than Native American, he wouldn't have made it past 12b6.""

**UTSW v. Nassar** 

* *Facts of the Case:* Dr. Naiel Nassar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, was hired by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) in 1995 to work at the Amelia Court Clinic (Clinic), which specializes in HIV/AIDS treatment. After three years there, he left to pursue additional training and returned in 2001 as an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Associate Medical Director of the Clinic. His immediate supervisor at the Clinic was Dr. Philip Keiser, whose supervisor at UTSW was Dr. Beth Levine. After being hired in 2004, Levine immediately began inquiring into Nassars productivity and billing practices. In 2005, after interviewing a candidate who was of Middle Eastern descent, Levine stated in Nassars presence, Middle Easterners are lazy. In 2006, after hiring the candidate, Levine made a similar statement in Keisers presence. Keiser informed Nassar of these comments as well as the fact that Levine scrutinized Nassars productivity more than any other doctor. Around this time, Nassar applied for a promotion that Levine actively undermined. In 2006, Nassar resigned from the UTSW faculty and cited Levines harassment and the creation of an unhealthy work environment in his resignation letter. Nassar resigned with the understanding that he would be offered a position at the Amelia Court Clinic unaffiliated with the UTSW, but the Clinic was forced to withdraw its offer after heavy opposition from the UTSW faculty, who have an agreement with the Clinic regarding positions to be filled by faculty doctors. In 2008, Nassar sued UTSW under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and argued that UTSW had constructively discharged and retaliated against him. The jury found in favor of Nassar and awarded him back pay and compensatory damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the retaliation claim but insufficient evidence to support the claim of constructive discharge.

* *Question:* Does the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 require a plaintiff to prove that an employer would not have taken an action but for the existence of an improper motive, or does the provision require only proof that the employer had mixed motives for taking an action? 

[Oral Argument.](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2010-2019/2012/2012_12_484)

Due to length constraints I will recommend checking out this [post](http://www.concurringopinions.com/archives/2013/06/sole-motives-and-university-of-texas-southwestern-medical-center-v-nassar.html) on the subject. Eyer believes this might be one of the most important civil rights cases this year along Shelby. What does the role of mixed motives play in employee discrimination? No act has a single motivator and the Court is divided.

Diamond v.  Chakrabarty, 447 U. S. 303, is central to the patent-eligibility inquiry whether such action was new with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature, id., at 310. Myriad did not create or alter either the genetic information encoded in the BCRA1 and BCRA2 genes or the genetic structure of the DNA.

(1) Whether Congresss approval of an interstate water compact that grants the contracting states equal rights to certain surface water and  using language present in almost all such compacts provides that the compact shall not be deemed . . . to interfere with each states appropriation, use, and control of water . . . not inconsistent with its obligations under this Compact, manifests unmistakably clear congressional consent to state laws that expressly burden interstate commerce in water; and (2) whether a provision of a congressionally approved multi-state compact that is designed to ensure an equal share of water among the contracting states preempts protectionist state laws that obstruct other states from accessing the water to which they are entitled by the compact.

*The Court rules that the compact does not preempt the state water laws of Oklahoma. This involves an interpretation of the Red River Compact.*

Whether 49 U.S.C. § 14501(c)(1), which provides that a State [or] political subdivision . . . may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property, contains an unexpressed market participant exception and permits a municipal governmental entity to take action that conflicts with the express preemption clause, occurs in a market in which the municipal entity does not participate, and is unconnected with any interest in the efficient procurement of services.

*The Court holds that federal law expressly preempts the agreement- two provisions dealing with displays by trucks in the port with regards to placards and parking.*

*Ninth circuit is reversed.*

The Third Cirucuit is affirmed. The arbitrator's decision in this case survives the limited judicial review allowed by the Federal Arbitration Act. The Court says that it doesn't necessarily agree with this arbitrator's view that class action arbitration was permitted under the contract, but that's the arbitrator job not a court's.

"2013-06-17",1371484426,"SCOTUS: Five opinions released today on 6/17/2013","(1). http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf

Details: **Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc.**

As part of an effort to increase voter registration and turnout, in 1993 Congress passed the National Voter Registration Act.  The Act requires states to accept and use a specific federal form for voter registration; that form asks, among other things, whether the would-be voter is a citizen of the United States and over the age of eighteen.  In 2004, Arizona voters approved a law that requires election officials in that state to refuse to register any would-be voter who cannot prove that he is in fact a citizen.  Arizona residents, along with voting and civil rights groups, challenged the state law, arguing that it could not stand because it conflicted with, and was trumped by, the NVRA.  The challengers won in the lower court, and the Supreme Court granted review last fall to consider not only whether the state law can survive, but also whether the lower court used the right test in making its decision:  that court held that because the Constitution allows Congress to make or change election rules established by the states, Congress can veto any state laws relating to elections, even if it doesnt make clear that it intends to do so.

Today the Court held, in a seven-to-two decision by Justice Scalia, that Arizonas law cannot stand in the face of the NVRA. The Court first recognized that under the Elections Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress has the power to dictate when, where, and how elections are held, and state election laws that conflict with federal ones are therefore preempted and without effect. The Court thus held that by requiring states to accept and use the federal form, the NVRA effectively required the states to treat the federal form as sufficient evidence of citizenship without any additional proof, so that Arizonas proof-of-citizenship requirement was contrary to the NVRA, and therefore invalid.  The Court recognized that the words accept and use do not necessarily carry such a broad meaning  they could mean only that the state was required to consider the federal form  but based on the context and the other provisions in the NVRA, the Court concluded that the requirement to accept and use the federal form has the stronger effect of requiring states to treat the federal form as sufficient. On the question of which legal test to apply, the Court made it clear that while preemption under the Supremacy Clause (which provides that federal law generally trumps contrary state law) requires Congress to clearly state its intent to preempt state requirements, preemption under the Elections Clause is more easily found because federal elections law will alwaysdisplace state law.

Finally, the Court held that in the future, Arizona can ask the federal Election Assistance Commission, which creates the federal form, to include a requirement of additional proof of citizenship in the form, and to bring different legal challenges if the EAC refuses to do so.

Justice Kennedy drafted a separate opinion concurring in part and in the judgment; Justices Thomas and Alito each filed a dissenting opinion, arguing that Arizonas requirement should not have been held preempted.

**Salinas v. Texas.**  

Texas CCA affirmed.  Issue: Whether or under what circumstances the Fifth Amendments Self-Incrimination Clause protects a defendants refusal to answer law enforcement questioning before he has been arrested or read his Miranda rights.  Alito opinion says the defendant did not expressly invoke his 5th Amendment rights so the prosecutor can comment on this silence to police questioning.

Details: **FTC v. Actavis**
This case is an antitrust challenge to an increasingly common practice in the pharmaceutical industry.  Brand-name companies faced with generic competition pay the would-be competitor an amount of money to stay out of the market.  The payment comes in the form of settling a dispute over the validity or infringement of the brand-name companys patent.  Because generic entry reduces drug prices, these pay for delay or reverse payment agreements are alleged to reduce competition and increase drug costs.  The Federal Trade Commission sued drug companies over one such deal.  The court of appeals rejected that claim, explaining that the brand names patent includes the right to exclude competitors.

Today, by a vote of five to three, the Supreme Court reversed and held that the claim can go forward.  Justice Breyer wrote the Courts opinion, joined by Justices Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan.  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas.  Justice Alito was recused from the case.

The Court held that the government and private parties may seek to prove that these payments violate the antitrust laws.  It refused, however, to hold them presumptively illegal.  The ruling is likely to essentially put an end to such payments in the future.  Litigation over previous deals will continue in the lower courts.

Details: **Maracich v. Spears**
A federal law, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA), prohibits the use of a drivers information from a state DMV without prior permission from the driver.  In this case, lawyers sued South Carolina car dealers on behalf of four individuals who had recently bought cars, alleging that the car dealers had violated a state consumer protection law.  Using contact information from the South Carolina DMV, they then tried to find additional plaintiffs for their lawsuits so that they could form a class action lawsuit.  However, lawyers for the car dealers then filed a lawsuit on behalf of other South Carolinians who had recently bought cars, alleging that the use of the information from the DMV violated the DPPA.  At issue before the Court was whether the original lawsuit against the car dealers was allowed under a provision of the DPPA that creates a litigation exception to the laws general ban on use of driver data; that exception allows the use of driver data in connection with any civil . . . proceeding in any Federal, State, or local court . . . including . . . investigation in anticipation of litigation.

Writing for a five-Justice majority, Justice Kennedys opinion for the Court held that the litigation exception does not apply to attorney solicitations of potential clients using DMV data.   Because the statute generally protects highly sensitive information, any exception should be read narrowly, the Court held.  The reference to an investigation in anticipation extends only to activities to decide whether a potential claim has sufficient merit to warrant a lawsuit, or to locate witnesses, but not activities designed to sign up clients for a case.

The Court remanded the case for the lower courts to decide whether, viewed objectively, the predominant purpose of the use of the DMV information was for client solicitation (in which case it was illegal) or for some other permissible litigation-related purposes (in which case it was legal).

Joining Justice Kennedys opinion were the Chief Justice, along with Justices Thomas, Breyer, and Alito.  Justices Ginsburg dissented, joined by Justices Scalia, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

**ALLEYNE v. UNITED STATES.**  

Issue: Whether this Courts decision in Harris v. United States, holding that the Constitution does not require facts which increase a mandatory minimum sentence to be determined by a jury, should be overruled.  

Held: Because mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime, any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an element that must be submitted to the jury.  Thomas went with majority.  He is into juries deciding things at least.

**Opinions-**

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf)

* The Seventh Circuit is affirmed. 

* Justice Ginsburg writes the dissent with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joining.

**Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )**

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  in clear conflict with this Courts decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf)

* First Circuit Reversed 

* Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. 

-----

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

* The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

----

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. 

* Eugene Volokh asks the big question of the day: ""Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?"" Some back and forth obviously occurred between the justices.""

* The NYT has their [analysis/blog](http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/2013-06-supreme-court-decisions?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;WT.z_sma=US_LAO_20130624) up on the decision.

-----

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

* Check out a thread from yesterday with more [info](http://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1gxfed/while_most_of_the_country_is_awaiting_the_big/) 

-----

Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. 

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

Decision summary: *The FAA does not permit courts to invalidate a contractual waiver of class arbitration on the ground that the plaintiffs cost of individually arbitrating a federal statutory claim exceeds the potential recovery.

**3) AID v. AFOSI (CJ Roberts writes, 6-2)**

Issue: Whether the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003, 22 U.S.C. § 7631(f), which requires an organization to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking in order to receive federal funding to provide HIV and AIDS programs overseas, violates the First Amendment.

Decision Summary: *The Court holds that the policy violates the First Amendment by compelling affirmation of a belief outside the scope of the program.

"2018-02-20",1519140071,"Noob Question regarding circuit courts decision on dreamers - why does a POTUS need to justify the rescinding of an executive order? Isnt that a contradiction in the separation of powers?","From what i read it sounds like the most recent circuit court argued POTUS has the authority to rescind an executive order, but had not provided sufficiently legal basis for it (please correct me if im mischaracterising).

Since its an executive order/policy, why does POTUS need to justify discontinuing it, and to whom? Wouldnt that be a blurring of the separation of powers?

It seems a little more tricky considering that this is, as I understand it, electively enforcing a change in operational policy, and selectively deffering to act in a certain way for certain cases, which, to my knowledge, DACA itself was (the legal status of dreamers was never changed, right? Just how the office prioritized their cases)? 


To my the knowledgle point of executive actions is to allow swift action to prevent stagnation while the legislature works on the longer term position/policy, wouldn't requiring justification for discontinuing an executive policy create an undue hurdle?

Wouldnt this set precedent for the courts or legislature to micromanage the executive branches reportees? 


Even if we accept that the potus needs to justify not acting in a certain way (which is itself dubious, justify actions sure, but not acting?? Opens up pabdoras box, no?), what is the litmus test? To my knowledge the argument put forward was that the practice is illegal to begin with since there was no initial authority to enact DACA within constitutional bounds, so the legal basis would be preventing the continuation of an illegal act? When there is potentially a illegal act occurring, is it not better to halt said act and determine legality, particularly when inaction itself is not illegal? 

If the executive branch opts not to pardon someone, or a judge sets aside a conviction, the courts cant compel the executive branch to pardon an individual, or affirm a conviction, while determining whether there is legal sufficiency for not pardoning the individual or setting aside the conviction. Or is that incorrect (courts being an imperfect example since its within the same branch of governemnt; a better example might be forcing a attorneys office to trial, even tho they believe there is insufficient legal stsnding to proceed and win,  in usurpation of prosecutorial discretion)?

So even if we accpet overview from the other branches on executive policy, which im not inclined towards, wouldn't the default be nonaction to begin with? Wouldnt compelling action be akin to the other branches usurping executive authority/overstepping vested powers?

There is a difference in saying the executive can't do something and that the executive branch must do something - which isn't technically law; no?

You may be able to tell that i happen to have a certain view on the legality of this but these are honest questions, am i missing something in my logic/fundamentals? Im not a lawyer and so eager to learn!

2. The 2nd amendment seems to be at odds with most gun control laws.
3. The first amendment seems to be at odds with the existence of ""Free Speech Zones.""

My guess is that there are specific legal justifications for those apparent differences, and that it's just my ignorant and superficial reading of those that make them look contradictory.

My question is this: Is there any concern in the legal/judicial community that regular people will see what I see, and conclude that the rules are being bent or broken?  Or that the law really is inconsistent?  Or, is the focus just on getting the law right and damn what the public thinks?

Please do correct me if I'm wrong.  But effectively this is what I've gathered from it...

&gt;In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point. In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives. In No. 13-356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company-Conestoga Wood Specialties-a preliminary injunction. Affirming, the Third [*2] Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not ""engage in religious exercise"" under RFRA or the First Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity. In No. 13-354, the Greens, their children, and their companies-Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel-were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed. It held that the Greens' businesses are ""persons"" under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the ""least restrictive means"" of furthering a compelling governmental interest.

This to me says... the Third Circuit ruled that they can not practice religion and therefore can not claim the exemption from the RFRA.  Then the Tenth Circuit ""reversed"" (which I understand to mean undid that ruling?  effectively making it so they *can* get out of paying for birth control).  Then we read the conclusion...

&gt;For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

What does this mean?  I read it as ""let's undo the Tenth's undoing and make it illegal for them to be exempt from it"".  I feel like I'm very obviously misunderstanding this.  Can anyone shed some light on this topic?

"2012-04-19",1334812761,"Does Equal Protection (Con. Law) apply to a union of classes or only an intersection?","   Im writing to get a discussion going about the best way to apply equal protection analysis to a law that classifies based on two classes.
     Here is a hypo to explain: A law precludes 21 to 24 year old males from being served more than two beers at a bar. Under equal protection analysis, there are two classes Age and Sex.

I. Under the analysis I was taught, we go through each class separately. The age class supports a rational basis analysis. The government says that the goal is to reduce drunk driving or more generally promote traffic safety. At least 25% of drunk driving accidents occur from people between the ages of 21-24, but only 3% of this age group gets into accidents. The goal rationally related to the means, so the law is fine as far as age goes. The sex classification is intermediate scrutiny. The goal is the same, and traffic safety is an important purpose. Under a means analysis, the law is overinclusive because not all men drive after they have had two beers; perhaps only 20% do. Additionally the law is over inclusive because some women drink and drive (5%). Thus, the means isnt substantially connected to the goal, and the law gets booted as being unconstitutional for violating equal protection. Disclaimer  statistics are mostly made up.

II. Under at least one case (Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976)), the Court looks at the statistics for the intersection of the classes and applies the highest level of scrutiny accorded the intersection. So&
 Under intermediate scrutiny the goal is the same (traffic safety), and it is important. The means is based on the statistic that compelled the law: about 92% of drunk driving accidents between people of ages 21-24 are caused by males, but only 2% of males between the ages of 21-24 get in such accidents. Only .18% of females of that age group get into such accidents. The goal is thus not substantially connected to the means, and the law gets chucked.

  Although, in this case both analyses get the law thrown out, I think the analyses (I. and II.) would play out differently under different suspect classes. For two non-suspect classes it would give you different answers. For instance,  a law that prevents age 21-24, gay people from serving alcohol because they are more likely to serve minors (with similar statistics as above). Under the first analysis (separating the classes) the law would hold up, but probably not under the second analysis (looking at the combined). 

 Juxtapose to another hypo -- affirmative action for two suspect classes: black, female engineers get a stipend for higher education to promote diversity in school. Grutter (539 U.S. 306) provides some precedent. In that case, a similar practice was upheld because race was not the only factor in admitting students to law school. The factors could be weighted to conform to Grutter: only females with a certain GPA are eligible for the scholarship, and if there is a tie the state school can consider ethnicity as tie breaker.  Under Analysis I the state practice would probably be ok (female engineers are an important goal to promote a balanced workforce, and race is ok to consider as one factor in the compelling interest of diversity under Grutter), but under analysis II the practice would probably be considered unconstitutional (race, sex, and GPA cannot be the sole criteria for the scholarship similar to Gratz, 539 U.S. 244 (2003).

It seems to me that career politicians, or those who are in public office for personal rather than public benefit, are in violation of bearing true faith and allegiance to the constitution. Yet I wouldn't be able to specify how - there's nothing in the constitution to suggest that authoring or voting for legislation that you know will have a net negative effect but will benefit your constituents / those keeping you in office, right?

"2014-06-08",1402196340,"Affirmative Action for Conservative Views?","It seems like every right wing/libertarian is complaining that they're views aren't getting exposed enough. They complain that it's a ""circlejerk"" and a downvote something or another.And it seems that the mods are SUPER SUPER sympathetic with their complaints.

**So I thought we should discuss it as a community. Do you really think there should be affirmative action for conservative views?**

I for one am absolutely sick of the CNN present a conservative &amp; present a liberal and have them argue both sides. It pretends as if the scientific weight of the evidence is equal on both sides. How many more times do we have to discuss climate change, or income inequality? These things exist. They're real, and the people who are experts in their field have no equivocation about them. There is already a multi-billion dollar industry tasked with helping right wing/libertarian talking points reach as wide of an audience as possible(no climate change, no income inequality, guns guns guns guns, etc). Can we really argue that not using mod authority to make these minority  (on Reddit) views more salient is some great injustice? Or as if there's some great injustice not balancing Reddit with opinions already spun from a billion dollar propaganda machine such as ""weather changes all the time""?

Lastly - I'd like to talk about the Elaboration Likelihood Model of attitude formation. It's premised on the idea that if you know very little about a very complicated subject (""Low Elaboration likelihood), like climate change, income inequality, then you will make your decisions on superficial determinants like who the speaker is, his position, his emotional posture, etc, amount of cognitive ease an argument allows you in etc etc (i.e. simple arguments that need little cognitive resources to evaluate are more likely to be believed). More importantly, you'll use these determinants instead of actual complicated things like facts, research, informed analysis from experts. This is exactly what the Mods are trying to do with Reddit. Their main focus isn't the truth of a matter. They act like politics is some realm divorced from the real world where nothing is falsifiable. And they spend all their time talking about ""bias, politeness, affirmative action of other view points, and concern trolling about the problem of a circlejerk."" And they feel these secondary considerations are the primary indicator of intelligent conversation.

I've studied a lot of research on attitude formation. And almost everything Mods and affirmative action conservatives say is so painfully based off of low information processing according to the ELM. Their arguments are mostly something along the lines of ""both parties bad."" ""OMG so liberal,"" ""OMG you disagree with different viewpoints gosh!"" Instead of actually discussing the peer reviewed evidence, scientific methods, expert opinions and factual information relevant to the discussion. They in themselves are making an argument based on cognitive ease - all viewpoints = better. This is  a simple argument to understand, takes almost 0 cognitive effort, those people who don't know the intricacies between policies decisions will likely just believe that. It's frustrating seeing people with such power follow such non logical views of how intellectual discourse should look like. 

Here's an example. If we were trying to determine the answer to 2 + 2. One party says 4 another party says 5. Instead of checking the math to see who's right, the Mods would have us check to see how many people are in unison agreement and whether we have a adequate variety of opinions. They'll carefully assess the tone of each person. Knowing that there can't possibly be a right answer, so the person who speaks with certitude and dismissal of other ideas, is probably wrong. They'll stress the importance of what the 3rd party that deviate from the two dominant views (""both side are the same evil party"") are saying since their impartiality makes them correct. If too many people are saying 4, they'll say ""It's a shame that we have people disagreeing with others for their opinions. The best forum is a place where people don't downvote others in oblivion just for ""disagreeing. (raise your hand if you've heard this talking point 10 times this week). But what they'll never do is actual math. 

While these secondary considerations have their place in fact finding, they certainly don't deserve a prime seat. And it seems almost all discussion in /r/politics dissolves into this. Low Elaboration likelihood discussions. And then they sit back with an air of worldly intelligence as if this type of discussion is intellectual and asking ""tough questions."" And marvel and how gentlemanly they are to ""view all viewpoints equally."" Even worse, the mods who have clearly never read one peer reviewed article about the science of persuasion, media manipulation, correcting misconceptions and how fact finding in public forums works, will then give others speeches about how terrible they are at understanding how policy discussion works. 

SO I honestly ask. Can we please, please end this madness of only discussing secondary considerations (i.e. whether there's enough conservative views, whether it's a circle jerk), and focus on primary considerations, like whether 2 + 2 is indeed 4 or 5. I know when you are looking at very complicated answers, it seems that there is no falsifiable answer. But this is soooo not true. Whether you like to believe it or not, some viewpoints are indeed right or wrong. We shouldn't be forced to listen to viewpoints that hve **been consistently proven to be wrong** because of a misguided view that these secondary considerations are what makes for intelligent discourse.

"2009-09-07",1252357450,"I will be very surprised if nobody raises any of these objections to Obama's school speech, now that the text has been released.","As you've probably seen, the [transcript](http://www.whitehouse.gov/MediaResources/PreparedSchoolRemarks/) of Obama's upcoming remarks to schoolchildren has been released.

Nothing surprising: it's very apolitical, and a nearly identical speech could have been given by McCain if he had won. But I bet that the people who have been fearmongering about this speech, the Glenn Becks of the world, will comb through this transcript word-by-word to find something, anything, to criticize, just so they don't have to admit they were wrong.

Here, I'll do it for them!

* ""When I was young, my family lived in Indonesia for a few years..."" -- RADICAL MADRASSA!! HE WANTS TO TURN OUR SCHOOLS INTO MUSLIN ISLAMOFASCIST MADRASSAS!!!!

* ""Ive talked about your parents responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and get your homework done, and dont spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with that Xbox."" -- HE'S TRYING TO TAKE AWAY PARENTS' PERSONAL FREEDOM IN DECIDING HOW TO RAISE THEIR KIDS!!!!

* ""Youll need the knowledge and problem-solving skills you learn in science and math to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS, and to develop new energy technologies and protect our environment."" -- GLOBAL WARMING IS A FAKE LIE AND AIDS IS GOD'S PUNISHMENT FOR FAGS!!!!! GOD BLESS AIDS AND OUR OIL WELLS!!!!

* ""Youll need the insights and critical thinking skills you gain in history and social studies to fight poverty and homelessness, crime and discrimination, and make our nation more fair and more free."" -- PEOPLE ARE POOR AND HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZY! THEY DON'T DESERVE OUR HELP!! ALSO DISCRIMINATION IS OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT!!! AND ""MAKING OUR NATION MORE FAIR"" SOUNDS LIKE SOCIALIST WEALTH REDISTRIBUTION!!!!

* ""But I was fortunate. I got a lot of second chances and had the opportunity to go to college, and law school, and follow my dreams. My wife, our First Lady Michelle Obama, has a similar story. Neither of her parents had gone to college, and they didnt have much. But they worked hard, and she worked hard, so that she could go to the best schools in this country."" -- IT WAS ALL JUST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION!! THEY TRYING TO KEEP THE WHITE MAN DOWN!!!! DIDN'T YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE SAID HE ONCE SAW A VIDEO WHERE MICHELLE OBAMA SAYS ""WHITEY""????!?!!

* ""Jazmin, Andoni and Shantell arent any different from any of you."" -- YES THEY ARE, THEY ALL SOUND LIKE FILTHY ILLEGAL FORRINURS!!!! THEY SHOULD ALL GO BACK TO AFRICA AND MEXICO OR WHATEVER!!!

* ""Maybe youll decide to get involved in an extracurricular activity, or volunteer in your community."" -- LIKE A _COMMUNITY ORGANIZER_??!?!??! OBAMA IS GOING TO MAKE ALL OF OUR KIDS JOIN ACORN AND TURN IT INTO HIS HITLER YOUTH!!!!!

* ""So find an adult you trust  a parent, grandparent or teacher; a coach or counselor  and ask them to help you stay on track to meet your goals."" -- HE DIDN'T MENTION CLERGY AS AN OPTION THERE!!!! WHY DOES OBAMA HATE CHRISTIANITY AND CHRISTIANS AND GOOD ALL-AMERICAN PATRIOTS SUCH AS JESUS CHRIST??!?!?

* ""Im working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books, equipment and computers you need to learn. But youve got to do your part too."" -- 'DO YOUR PART TOO'????! THAT SOUNDS LIKE _FASCIST COMMUNISM_!!!!

I'll be surprised if none of these objections are seriously raised in the next few days. The people who complained before the transcript was posted will prefer to seem even crazier (they won't know or care) over resolving their cognitive dissonance the right way.","politics",5,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9i7ki/i_will_be_very_surprised_if_nobody_raises_any_of/"

It Tells you What To Do! 
""**When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.**

**We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.** ""


**Everyone Needs To Empty Into The Streets, ARMED!**

- Do Not Seek Violence but be Ready to Defend yourself, family, friends, and your community. 

- Send a clear message to Congress and the President that their actions are unacceptable. The larger the groups, the better. Spread the word via Social Media ([Twitter](http://twitter.com/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/up/?continue=https://plus.google.com/&amp;type=st), etc...), Tell your neighbors.

For all that took it, Never forget the [Oath of Enlistment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces_oath_of_enlistment)

""**I, (Name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same;...**""

Constitutional Rights Guaranteed to Natural Human Persons Only and Not Corporations; 3. Public Financing of Political Campaigns; 4. 21 Year Term Limits for All Offices.","**Four Constitutional Amendments we desperately need.**

1. Congress itself shall be subject to all the laws it makes which are binding upon the People.  Congress shall make no law granting itself or its members any special privileges, immunities, or exemptions from law other than those already provided for in this Constitution; and any such special privileges in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered null and void and entirely severable - whether embodied in statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom - immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing Congress from enacting any law or promulgating any rule which sole purpose is to guarantee or enhance the physical security or safety of the Congress, its members, employees, contractors, buildings, offices, or grounds. 

2.  The rights guaranteed to individuals, persons, and the People under this Constitution are guaranteed to natural born human persons only, and no rights whatsoever are guaranteed or granted or implied by this Constitution to corporations or other artificial legal entities. Any and every existing contrary provision of any statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom purporting or affirming the embodiment of corporate personal rights in this Constitution in existence at the time this Article is ratified shall be rendered  null and void, without effect, and entirely severable immediately upon ratification of this Article.  The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.  Congress may also enact legislation to endow corporations and other legal entities with whatever rights, privileges, and responsibilities it deems suitable and fitting, provided that any such rights and privileges granted may never supersede or diminish the rights and privileges guaranteed to natural born human persons under this Constitution. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as absolving any corporation of legal accountability for its actions, forgiving any corporate debts, or nullifying any existing judgement against any corporation in suit at law or equity.

3.  All elections at every level of government in these United States shall be financed by public funding only, except that bone-fide individual natural human citizens of the United States may directly contribute an amount not to exceed an annual total of five hundred dollars to all parties combined to the candidates and issue advocacy groups of their choice. No political party or committee may have any influence over the allocation and distribution of public funds, and the requirements for eligibility to receive public funding shall be the same for all persons seeking the same office, regardless of political party affiliation or non-affiliation.  This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

4. No person shall serve in any one elected or appointed government office, including judiciary offices, for more than a total of twenty-one years in their entire lifetime. This Article amends any contrary provision of this Constitution, and renders any and every existing contrary statute, rule, regulation, legislation, court ruling, case law, common law, precedent, or other law or custom null and void and of no effect and entirely severable. This provision shall take effect immediately upon ratification of this Article. The Congress may enact legislation to enforce this Article.

Edit:  Added ""Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing Congress from enacting any law or promulgating any rule which sole purpose is to guarantee or enhance the physical security or safety of the Congress, its members, employees, contractors, buildings, offices, or grounds."" Changed word ""granting such rights"" to ""purporting or affirming the embodiment of corporate personal rights in this Constitution"" in item #2.  Also appended "" Congress may also enact legislation to endow corporations and other legal entities with whatever rights and privileges it deems suitable and fitting, provided that such rights and privileges may never supersede or diminish the rights and privileges guaranteed to natural human persons under this Constitution."" to the end of item #2. Inserted word ""born"". Added "" Nothing in this Article shall be construed as absolving any corporation of legal accountability for its actions, forgiving any corporate debts, or nullifying any existing judgement against any corporation in suit at law or equity.""

**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity. The petitioners in these cases seek to find that liberty by marrying someone of the same sex and having their marriages deemed lawful on the same terms and conditions as marriages between persons of the opposite sex.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majoritys approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens  through the democratic process  to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution  even as confined to opposite-sex relations  has evolved over time.
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**  
The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitutions central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.  
  
**Chief Justice Roberts, in dissent:**  
Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority opinion:**    
No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilizations oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. [The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit^pdf](http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/14a0275p-06.pdf) is reversed. It is so ordered.  

**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
Judges are selected precisely for their skill as lawyers; whether they reflect the policy views of a particular constituency is not (or should not be) relevant. Not surprisingly then, the Federal Judiciary is hardly a cross-section of America. Take, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on todays social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges, answering the legal question whether the American people had ever ratified a constitutional provision that was understood to proscribe the traditional definition of marriage. But of course the Justices in todays majority are not voting on that basis; they say they are not. And to allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.  
  
  
**Justice Kennedy, in majority's opinion:**  
These considerations lead to the conclusion that the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person, and under the [Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv) couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of that right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be denied to them. [Baker v. Nelson^pdf](http://www.leg.state.mn.us/webcontent/lrl/issues/SameSexMarriages/BakerNelson.pdf) must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.  
  
**Justice Scalia, in dissent:**  
If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity, I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.  
  
  
  
  
  
[President Obamas address](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/26/transcript-obamas-remarks-on-supreme-court-ruling-on-same-sex-marriage/)  
Our nation was founded on a bedrock principle that we are all created equal. The project of each generation is to bridge the meaning of those founding words with the realities of changing times  a never-ending quest to ensure those words ring true for every single American.  
Progress on this journey often comes in small increments. Sometimes two steps forward, one step back, compelled by the persistent effort of dedicated citizens. And then sometimes there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.  
This morning, the Supreme Court recognized that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality. In doing so, they have reaffirmed that all Americans are entitled to the equal protection of the law; that all people should be treated equally, regardless of who they are or who they love.  
This decision will end the patchwork system we currently have. It will end the uncertainty hundreds of thousands of same-sex couples face from not knowing whether theyre marriage, legitimate in the eyes of one state, will remain if they decide to move or even visit another.  
This ruling will strengthen all of our communities by offering to all loving same-sex couples the dignity of marriage across this great land.  
In my second inaugural address, I said that if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. It is gratifying to see that principle enshrined into law by this decision.  
This ruling is a victory for Jim Obergefell and the other plaintiffs in the case. Its a victory for gay and lesbian couples who have so long for their basic civil rights. Its a victory for their children, whose families will now be recognized as equal to any other. Its a victory for the allies and friends and supporters who spent years, even decades working and praying for change to come.  
And this ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are treated as equal, we are all more free.  
My administration has been guided by that idea. Its why we stopped defending the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and why we were pleased when the court finally struck down the central provision of that discriminatory law. Its why we ended, Dont Ask, Dont Tell.  
From extending full marital benefits to federal employees and their spouses to expanding hospital visitation rights for LGBT patients and their loved ones, weve made real progress in advancing equality for LGBT Americans in ways that were unimaginable not too long ago.  
I know a change for many of our LGBT brothers and sisters must have seemed so slow for so long. But compared to so many other issues, Americas shift has been so quick.  
I know that Americans of good will continue to hold a wide range of views on this issue. Opposition, in some cases, has been based on sincere and deeply held beliefs. All of us who welcome todays news should be mindful of that fact and recognize different viewpoints, revere our deep commitment to religious freedom.  
But today should also give us hope that on the many issues with which we grapple, often painfully, real change is possible. Shift in hearts and minds is possible. And those who have come so far on their journey to equality have a responsibility to reach back and help others join them, because for all of our differences, we are one people, stronger together than we could ever be alone. Thats always been our story.  
We are big and vast and diverse, a nation of people with different backgrounds and beliefs, different experiences and stories but bound by the shared ideal that no matter who you are or what you look like, how you started off or how and who you love, America is a place where you can write your own destiny.  
We are people who believe every child is entitled to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There is so much more work to be done to extend the full promise of America to every American. But today, we can say in no uncertain terms that weve made our union a little more perfect.  
Thats the consequence of a decision from the Supreme Court, but more importantly, it is a consequence of the countless small acts of courage of millions of people across decades who stood up, who came out, talked to parents, parents who loved their children no matter what, folks who were willing to endure bullying and taunts, and stayed strong, and came to believe in themselves and who they were and slowly made an entire country realize that love is love.  
What an extraordinary achievement, but what a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things; what a reminder of what Bobby Kennedy once said about how small actions can be like pebbles being thrown into a still lake, and ripples of hope cascade outwards and change the world.  
Those countless, often anonymous heroes, they deserve our thanks. They should be very proud.   America should be very proud.  
  
Thank you.

"2012-09-08",1347065956,"Because my Republican brother thinks all Democrats are Communists - I'm going to donate my fantasy football buy-in money to re-elect Barack Obama","Usually, when August approaches, Ill ""invest"" $150 dollars that Ill inevitably never see again. See, Im a jinx. The albatross. The grand pessimist. Everyones Debbie Downer. The guy who still uses a blackberry and Hotmail. Im the guy scared of the swine flu, gonorrhea, a resurgence of SARS, asthma, third-hand smoke, anemia, scabies, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, brain aneurysms, West Nile virus, blindness, obesity, diabetes, MSG, adult acne  to name a few.
But when I turned 30 this year, on August 13th, I got my yearly fantasy football invite. Last year, I was the runner up  which is Gods yearly routine to remind me that I always deserve a ribbon for participation. And, while Im no religious zealot, I believe God threw his weight into my fantasy football league and injured Tony Romo during my championship game, on the third snap of the game, nonetheless  ruining my chances of victory. Or Gratification. Or Happiness.  

And while many people abhor turning 30, I didnt. I was a failure the day before I turned 30  so naturally, being a failure a day later when I actually turned 30 didnt feel any differently. But the day I got my fantasy football invite  suddenly, I felt alive. My allergies (all 32 of them) dissipated. The sun seemed friendlier  not like a symbol of melanoma. I had swag. I had confidence. I was& Content.

So I excitedly accepted my fantasy football invite and registered my team name  ""The Bad News Baers."" I was already envisioning some of the jive I could throw down after I drafted Calvin Johnson for the fourth year in a row (my longest relationship ever.) It was going to be glorious. Incredible. Life changing. My moment in the sun without sunblock.  I would finally win a fantasy football championship and stop being applauded for ""trying.""

I was going to ruin everyones Sunday when I trampled his or her team. And Id remind them of said trampling on Monday, and Tuesday, and most likely Wednesday.

But then something happened.  My brother called me to wish me a happy birthday. And with that, we got into our usual political discourse. And five minutes after beginning our conversation with a happy birthday, he accused me of idolizing the values of Joseph Stalin and Karl Marx.

Which made me think about the good old days. Before Sarah Palin. Before Eric Bolling. Before Michelle Malkin. And before the Tea Party& When I could have a civil discussion over politics with someone who doesnt share any of my political ideology. Today, they say I support Communism.

And while Id love to blame Sarah Palin, Eric Bolling or Sean Hannity  all who spew hatred and barefaced disrespect toward our President  they are just a few phony entertainers trying to make a Republican dollar out of our Democratic Euros. 

Its Republican strategist Steve Schmidt who created this hullabaloo. 

Four years ago, Republicans and Democrats in Congress were all just aspiring plutocrats interested in lining their own pockets. They were greedy. But we knew this. We werent stupid. But not today.

Today, the Tea Party is the Frankenstein Schmidt created. And he should feel guilty. He was so desperate to win the Presidency for McCain - he put someone who wasnt qualified, let alone bright, on the ticket for Vice President. In his next life, Steve Schmidt should be reincarnated as a Transvaginal Ultrasound wand in a liberal-friendly county Planned Parenthood. 

But I bet he didnt expect this decision would have such a bombastic effect on the country after their losing bid for the Presidency. Most likely, Schmidt thought Palin would go back to Wasilla and say funny things about Putin rearing his head into Alaska, or nuclear weapontry, or Africa being a state, or death panels, or refudiating the media  anything that is factually incorrect, or words not found in a dictionary.

But she didn't go away. She grew. She got bigger. She developed a following.

Her Tea Party has compared President Obama to Hitler. Palin herself has accused our President of palling around with terrorists. A socialist. A man of no valor. And that's only a few. The list goes on. Donald Trump and his birther fiasco. Although in fairness, Trump invented Trump Vodka, Celebrity Apprentice and eats pizza with a fork (which is a kind of a foreign thing to do, Donald Trump.) Arizona Governor Jan Brewer pointing her finger into the face of our President. Kansas House Speaker reciting a bible verse calling for President Obama to be killed. Newt Gingrich referring to our President as the most successful food stamp President of all time and his Kenyan anti-colonial behavior. Senator Mitch McConnell publicly announcing his number one priority was making sure the President wasnt re-elected. Congressman Joe Wilson screaming out you lie during the Presidents State of the Union address. Speaker John Boehner refusing the Presidents date to speak to a joint session on jobs. Allen West saying President Obama creates economic slaves. Michele Bachmann connecting the Swine Flu to Obama. And the list goes on and on and on.

And even worse  Mitt Romney, who is a moderate at heart, has turned on Yoda, cutting every sensible bone off his body with his red lightsaber and embraced the dark side  all to appease Darth Vader and his cronies - Fox News and their impressionable disciples.

Which brings me back to my point. To them, Im a Communist. Why?

Because I want women to be left alone. Because I want to drink clean water. Because I want the rich to pay a little more in taxes. Because I believe that everyone should be entitled to healthcare. Because I believe in gay marriage. Because I believe in climate change. Because I believe in amnesty for illegal immigrants who were taken to the United States through no fault of their own. Because I believe in free and fair elections. Because I believe in human rights. Because I dont care about religion  but believe everyones religious values should be respected. Because I believe in equal pay for women. Because I believe abortion should be left up to a woman. Because I believe in stricter gun laws. Because I believe in affirmative action. And because I dont believe every conflict needs to be settled by war.

&So that makes me a Marxist?

But then there's the irony when a Republican compares me to a murderer like Joseph Stalin& When Im the one who doesnt want to fight a war and Dick Cheney, Halliburton and countless Republican Senators and Representatives make money off war.  

Which brings me back to my point - fantasy football. I will not play fantasy football this year, but rather  I will donate the $150 to the Presidents re-election campaign. And while I know $150 wont change anything  especially with Citizens United, Im hoping more people like me wont splurge on something this year and spend it on someone who will make your future brighter. Someone who will continue to clean up this mess caused by the Republicans. Someone who will fight for the middle class. Someone who doesnt care who you marry. Someone who doesn't want to utter the words - Transvaginal Ultrasound.  And someone who wants everyone to have affordable healthcare.   

That isnt Mitt Romney. He has now donned the Darth Vader armor  paid for by the Koch Brothers, Sheldon Adelson and the like. And if Mitt Romney cant stand up to leaders of his own party now  imagine what kind of puppet hed become if elected President of the United States.

And Remember, President Obama set forth the greenlight for the Osama Bin Laden mission while embarrassing Donald Trump during the White House Correspondents Dinner  killing Trumps dignity and credibility, and icing Bin Laden, too.

Mitt Romney would need to see internal polling before making such a decision. Or change his mind half way through the mission. Or just promise to repeal ObamaCare.

Finally someone has the guts to say what so many of the rest of us have been thinking....

 
BUCHANAN TO OBAMA

Barack says we need to have a conversation about race in America . Fair enough. But this time, it has to be a two-way conversation. White America needs to be heard from, not just lectured to.. This time, the Silent Majority needs to have its convictions, grievances and demands heard. And among them are these:

First, America has been the best country on earth for black folks. It was here that 600,000 black people, brought from Africa in slave ships, grew into a community of 40 million, were introduced to Christian salvation, and reached the greatest levels of freedom and prosperity blacks have ever known. Wright ought to go down on his knees and thank God he is an American.

Second, no people anywhere has done more to lift up blacks than white Americans. Untold trillions have been spent since the ' 60s on welfare, food stamps, rent supplements, Section 8 housing, Pell grants, student loans, legal services, Medicaid, Earned Income Tax Credits and poverty programs designed to bring the African-American community into the mainstream. Governments, businesses and colleges have engaged in discrimination against white folks -- with affirmative action, contract set-asides and quotas -- to advance black applicants over white applicants. Churches, foundations, civic groups, schools and individuals all over America have donated their time and money to support soup kitchens, adult education, day care, retirement and nursing homes for blacks.

We hear the grievances. Where is the gratitude???

Barack talks about new 'ladders of opportunity' for blacks. Let him go to Altoona ? And Johnstown , and ask the white kids in Catholic schools how many were visited lately by Ivy League recruiters handing out scholarships for 'deserving' white kids.? Is white America really responsible for the fact that the crime and incarceration rates for African-Americans are seven times those of white America ? Is it really white America 's fault that illegitimacy in the African-American community has hit 70 percent and the black dropout rate from high schools in some cities has reached 50 percent?

Is that the fault of white America or, first and foremost, a failure of the black community itself?

As for racism, its ugliest manifestation is in interracial crime, and especially interracial crimes of violence. Is Barack Obama aware that while white criminals choose black victims 3 percent of the time, black criminals choose white victims 45 percent of the time?

Is Barack aware that black-on-white rapes are 100 times more common than the reverse, that black-on-white robberies were 139 times as common in the first three years of this decade as the reverse?

We have all heard ad nauseam from the Rev. Al about Tawana Brawley, the Duke rape case and Jena . And all turned out to be hoaxes. But about the epidemic of black assaults on whites that are real, we hear nothing.

Sorry, Barack, some of us have heard it all before, about 40 years and 40 trillion tax dollars ago.
We are a Christian Nation even if Mr. Obama says we are not.","politics",79,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9b1by/so_my_conservative_grandfather_forwarded_this/"

"2019-11-20",1574265491,"Megathread: Sondland testifies Trump ordered Ukraine quid pro quo through Giuliani","U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified Wednesday that there was a quid pro quo between Ukraine conducting politically motivated investigations and getting a meeting between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sondland said the connection between these two issues was widely known throughout the administration. ""I know that members of this Committee have frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes,"" Sondland said in his opening statement. He also said he worked with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine issues on ""the presidents orders,"" confirming Trumps active participation in a controversy that threatens his presidency.

"2010-10-25",1287991881,"6 out of 10 propositions on my Arizona Ballot are outright lies, cleverly written to deceive voters.","There is a disturbing trend among these propositions:

1) They are written on the ballot in a style that hides their real effects. 

2) Some will permanently take away powers from the voters. 

3) The sponsors reference false threats and fears that do not really exist.

4) They attack vulnerable groups. 

5) They are sponsored by outside groups who want to gain a foothold for a cause, not improve AZ.


**Prop 107: Ending 'discrimination' by banning efforts to close racial education gaps** 

*What the ballot says:* This will make racial discrimination a state crime.

*Real effect:* Will end scholarships, classes and early-start programs designed to inform hispanics/natives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* AZ doesn't have affirmative action! Just specialized education programs.

*Outside sponsorship:* Sponsored almost entirely by Colorado group that attacks affirmative action all around the country.


**Prop 109: Tweek the AZ Constitution to take away voter control over wildlife issues**

*What the ballot says:* Make hunting a protected constitutional right regulated by the legislature.

*Real effect:* The voters will be barred from passing popular wildlife initiatives.

*Baseless fear mongering:* There is no threat to hunting rights, and they are already protected.

*Outside sponsorship:* The NRA was the original and by far the largest sponsor.


**Prop 112: Make it even more impossible for citizens to get initiatives on the ballot**

*What the ballot says:* ""A Yes vote will change the initiative filing deadline from 4 months to 6 months prior to election""

*Real effect:* The wording is almost impossible to understand in this proposition. It would shorten the time available to citizens to collect signatures for popular initiatives. There is so little time already that citizens can almost never gather the required amount. This year, the only popular initiative that was able to make it to the AZ ballot is the medical marijuana proposition. This would end choice in establishment favorites such as photo radar.


**Prop 113: Make it prohibitively complicated for groups of workers to unionize**

*What the ballot says:* Protect the workers' right to a secret ballot.

*Real effect:* Forces unions to have the most complicated form of initiation even though less complicated forms are generally considered adequate and fair.

*Baseless fear mongering:* The worker's right to privacy is not threatened currently, and unions are vehemently against this possible new, expensive requirement.

*Outside sponsorship:* Anti-union front groups. http://www.progressivestates.org/node/22564


**Prop 301: Take all the money from the Land Conservation Fund with no future repayment**

**Prop 302: Take all the money from the Early Childhood Development Fund with no future repayment** 

*What the ballot says:* Please help move the balance of these funds into the general fund.

*Real effects and motivation:*
Jan Brewer always says that she has balanced the budget. In reality, she meant that the budget is balanced if voters approve her two propositions, 301 &amp; 302. Otherwise an 800 million dollar shortfall/deficit remains. These two propositions will take money out of funds to help children. These funds were created by voters and thus need voter approval to be raided. Brewer doesn't want new taxes, except this hidden tax on POOR CHILDREN.

**Edit:** Thank you for your comments. I want to point out that there are other propositions that I do not like. These are clearly worded, however, and therefore I avoided posting them in this submission. 

I elaborate elsewhere in the comments, but here is a good alternative source provided by SporkofThor:
http://race.change.org/blog/view/will_arizona_voters_roll_back_racial_progress_with_prop_107

Whether you agree with affirmative action or not, the writers of Prop. 107 should be more honest and portray their intent truly on the ballot.

In a ruling divided along ideological lines, the high courts six-justice conservative majority found that the universities discriminated against white and Asian American applicants by using race-conscious policies that benefited applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion, saying the Harvard and UNC admissions programs lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race, unavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.

We have never permitted admissions programs to work in that way, and we will not do so today. he wrote.

The three liberal justices dissented; with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying the ruling closes the door of opportunity that the Courts precedents helped open to young students of every race.

And it was all a Republican plan, fantasized by Nixon, and realized by Reagan.","[The New Jim Crow] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Jim_Crow#Chapter_1:_The_Rebirth_of_Caste)

&gt;The [1970s] saw a number of issues, such as civil rights enforcement, affirmative action, busing and welfare (conservatives indirectly suggested that the blacks were refusing to work, because they preferred to live off government hand-outs) developing into intense controversies. Nixon declared illicit drugs a ""public enemy number one"" and declared a ""war on drugs"", although no specific drug enforcement policy was yet envisioned and no right wing race and social policy consensus had yet emerged.

&gt;The conservative revolution with the political focus in the Republican Party reached its mature stage when Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980. Reagan issued many implicit, but formally race-neutral appeals concerning crime, welfare, taxes and state rights and his candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by frustrated and disaffected whites; 22% of all Democrats ended up voting for him. Once elected, Reagan proceeded to fulfill his promise of enhancing the federal government's role in combating crime, which at first seemed to be no easy task, since street crime had traditionally been the area of jurisdiction and responsibility of state and local authorities. But the determination was there and the expansion of federal authority posed no difficulty for conservative politicians in this case.

&gt;The Justice Department first announced the cutting in half of the personnel assigned to the prosecution of white-collar crimes and switching its emphasis to street crime, especially the enforcement of illegal drug policies. In October 1982, President Reagan officially declared his administration's ""War on Drugs"", a political move intended to facilitate the implementation of the white right wing's informal race policies that were then assuming a definitive shape, rather than to address the (quite limited at that time) public concern about drugs.","politics",136,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ydma3/the_war_on_drugs_costs_billions_has_created_a/"

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

#UPDATES:

[Gundy v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-6086_2b8e.pdf)

&gt;Congress has sought, for the past quarter century, to combat sex crimes
and crimes against children through sex-offender registration
schemes. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)
makes more uniform and effective the prior patchwork of registration systems. Reynolds v. United States, 565 U. S. 432, 435. To
that end, it requires a broader range of sex offenders to register and
backs up those requirements with criminal penalties. Section 20913
elaborates the [i]nitial registration requirements for sex offenders.
34 U. S. C. §§20913(b), (d). Subsection (b) sets out the general rule:
An offender must register before completing a sentence of imprisonment with respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement. §20913(b). Subsection (d) addresses the [i]nitial registration of sex offenders unable to comply with subsection (b). The
provision states that, for individuals convicted of a sex offense before
SORNAs enactment (pre-Act offenders), the Attorney General
shall have the authority to specify the applicability of SORNAs
registration requirements and to prescribe rules for [their] registration. §20913(d). Under that delegated authority, the Attorney General issued a rule specifying that SORNAs registration requirements
apply in full to pre-Act offenders. Petitioner Herman Gundy, a preAct offender, was convicted of failing to register. Both the District
Court and the Second Circuit rejected his claim that Congress unconstitutionally delegated legislative power when it authorized the Attorney General to specify the applicability of SORNAs registration
requirements to pre-Act offenders. 

&gt;**Held: The judgment is affirmed.**

I am not the only voter disaffected with the Clintons dishonest and divisive nature. {[1](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ronda-lee/i-cant-vote-for-hillary_b_9119658.html)}  

Hillary's lip service and pandering [has been blatant this entire campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3iBb1gvehI).  

[There are plenty of skeletons in Hillary's closet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kypl1MYuKDY); what is posted below is a representative sample.  Hillary's history is enough to scare most people that put time in to learn about her.  [Hillary's Wall St connections and donations](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46qbn3/here_are_all_of_hillary_clintons_wall_street/), the tens of millions the Clintons made in ""speaking fees"" (legalized bribery), and her refusal to release transcripts of paid speeches are equally deplorable. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46mr9r/sanders_accepts_clintons_challenge_on_wall_street/d06l7ty)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47y0fr/everyone_wants_to_know_what_was_in_hillary/)}

The Clintons have a pretty disgusting history of pathological lying, dishonesty, manipulation, corruption, vindictive behavior, and dirty tricks including smearing honest credible people through [whisper campaigns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisper_campaign).
They also don't mind sending out supporters and surrogates to do their dirty work.  

One of the most egregious violations so far this election involves Clinton ties to MSNBC host Chris Matthews and MSNBC contributor/WAPO editor Jonathan Capehart.

There are other documented accounts of major media organizations manipulating coverage and protecting Hillary. {[1](http://www.salon.com/2016/03/16/new_york_times_busted_for_anti_bernie_bias_the_iconic_clinton_endorsing_newspaper_slyly_edits_article_to_smear_sanders/)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47z286/memetics_manipulation_and_suppression_how_cnn/)}{[3](http://m.dailykos.com/stories/1499966)}{[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4ag1cr/msnbcs_chris_matthews_faces_call_to_suspend_show/d109wmv)}{[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orlC31eFTc0)}

Questions remain if Hillary will be indicted by the FBI for hosting a private server that exposed classified information to the internet.  Hillary's server was setup to circumvent archival requirements of the Federal Records Act and FOIA requests.  The Clinton Foundation is also under an FBI investigation for pay-to-play access involving Hillary's DoS actions in exchange for ""donations.""  {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/47kt9u/whichhillary_twitter_trend_calls_out_clinton_for/d0dv5mh?context=1)}{[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary is currently under six investigations, but the FBI and OIG investigations are the most severe.  

And if that isn't enough ..

[Hillary displays traits commonly attributed with APD - Psychopathy](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/46lyqu/hillary_clinton_i_dont_believe_i_have_ever_lied/d06mmjb).

**Re: Hillary's email server and the pending FBI investigation**

**Apr 22, 1994**:

[Hillary Clinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOMpU9RriSY&amp;t=21s): ""I've always believed in a zone of privacy and I told a friend the other day that I feel after resisting for a long time that I've been re-zoned.""

**Mar 4, 2016**:  
[Hillary Clinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L70jPvppWBM): ""I've been the most transparent public official in modern times as far as I know.""

&gt; Wow, so it's possible there is ""No Classified Markings"", because she had her aides transcribe classified material by hand onto her server...


See post by /u/Rhamni for [a good **ELI5**](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/49wttd/hillarys_no_classified_markings_canard_actually/d0vm5ca)


For the **non-lazy**,

Start with the statements from the IC IG.

Then read ""Hillary's disingenuous claim that nothing was marked ""classified.""

It's also important to point out that the FBI email investigation is completely separate from a secondary FBI investigation into pay-to-play abuses that involve donations to The Clinton Foundation preceding/following actions by Hillary during her time as Secretary of State. {[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/489ph0/final_clinton_emails_coming_today/d0hyuwc?context=3)}

Hillary and her Chief-of-Staff Cheryl Mills [did not sign OF-109 forms upon leaving State](http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/16/3037241/).  This was deliberate.

&gt; That statement would have required her to affirm that she had returned all classified materials in her possession.

**Re: Jonathan Capehart (WAPO/MSNBC) smears Sanders civil rights record**  
**Re: Chris Matthews bias and conflict of interest**  

http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/02/the-jonathan-capehart-saga-or-why-progressives-hav.html

...

This is an example of the incestuous relationship between ""journalists"" and politicians.

The Clintons have [a history of using journalists to push stories](http://gawker.com/this-is-how-hillary-clinton-gets-the-coverage-she-wants-1758019058).   On Thursday Feb. 11, 2016, Capehart published [an editorial in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2016/02/11/stop-sending-around-this-photo-of-bernie-sanders/) and [sent out tweets](http://archive.is/BCLLM) [check the summaries] smearing Sanders civil rights record.  Capehart repeated the smear claims during a post democratic debate interview [on a special edition of Hardball on MSNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AshSzj0F-nU) (Feb 11).  

It should be noted that the spouse of MSNBC's Chris Matthews is [Kathleen Matthews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Matthews) formerly of Marriott International, [who worked closely with the Clinton Foundation for four years to open a Marriott hotel in Haiti](http://news.marriott.com/2015/05/kathleen-matthews-departs-marriott-international-to-pursue-new-opportunity.html).  Kathleen Matthews, funded by Hillary donors and friends {[1](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/14/media/chris-matthews-kathleen-matthews/)}{[2](https://theintercept.com/2016/03/11/chris-matthewss-hardball-guests-have-given-79050-to-his-wife-kathleens-congressional-campaign/)}{[3](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/09/hillary-donors-helping-chris-matthews-wife-into-congress/)}{[4](http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/13/ten-thousand-demand-chris-matthews-suspension-msnbc-silent/)}, is running for the U.S. House of Representatives for Maryland's 8th congressional district..  

Watch these vids {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuMnN4wvBY)}{[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqjp8dYOvu0)}{[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMdeXrfkmU)}, Chris Matthews is heavily biased.

This explains how Capehart's smears went unchallenged. A prominent progressive site has called for MSNBC to suspend Chris Matthews for continued shilling and bias. [link removed - it violates the rules?]

Danny Lyon the original photographer, heard of the smears and [posted additional negatives to his blog](https://dektol.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/more-bernie-civil-rights-photos-found) proving the man [in the original photo](https://dektol.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-29-at-6-49-15-pm.png) was Sanders.  On Friday Feb 12, Capeheart repeated his claims live [on MSNBC Andrea Mitchell Reports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RDTOUJHY). 

Capehart failed to disclose a direct conflict of interest acknowledging [his long term romantic relationship with long time Clinton staffer Nick Schmit](http://capitolfile-magazine.com/inside-jonathan-capehart-and-nick-schmits-house) and refuses to print a retraction or apologize. It's a pretty transparent hit piece attempting to discredit Sanders civil rights record in the lead up to the South Carolina primary on Feb 27.

To maintain ethical integrity and standards of a news outlet and as a journalist you are supposed to disclose conflicts or avoid them entirely. 

Schmit [has worked for the Clintons in various capacities since 2004-2005](http://web.archive.org/web/20160215055916/https://twitter.com/McSquirmishes/status/699032420029337601) as an employee of the Clinton Foundation, staff on Hillary's 2008 campaign, and subsequently moved to the US State Department in 2009 under Hillary where he has remained as a GS-14 Schedule C appointment [maybe his job is in jeopardy next year if Clinton doesn't win].

Shortly after Capehart's smear campaign, the twitter account [@FauxJCapehart](https://twitter.com/FauxJCapehart/with_replies) appeared. [[archived](http://archive.is/XrGMW)] 

As outrageous and disturbing as Capehart's actions are, the conversations initiated by troll account @FauxJCapehart is probably one of the most hilarious things to come from this election cycle.

**Re: Dolores Huerta: Sanders supporters chanted ""English only!""** {debunked}

**Video**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiHDo-uEIi4

Huerta is a surrogate of Hillary Clinton.  She is a well known hispanic political activist and founder of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union. When Clinton routinely mentions support from the UFW that support is solidified by her personal and financial relationship with Dolores.

Huerta made [accusations against Obama in 2008](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/2/21/1488535/-Dolores-Huerta-did-the-same-thing-to-Obama-in-2008) and [received a $100,000 donation from the Clinton Foundation in 2010](http://990s.foundationcenter.org/990pf_pdf_archive/300/300048438/300048438_201012_990PF.pdf). [page 33]

After the Nevada Caucus, Dolores Huerta and Ugly Betty star America Ferrera claimed supporters of Bernie Sanders chanted ""English only."" {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1l5SHR4GvE)}{[2](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094857/https://twitter.com/DoloresHuerta/status/701184235315400705)}{[3](http://web.archive.org/web/20160224094846/https://twitter.com/AmericaFerrera/status/701166307387928577)} 

[This is false](http://www.snopes.com/sanders-english-only-huerta/).  

A person in the audience noted that people only spoke Spanish and needed a translator.  Precinct Chair Raymond Buckley asked if there was a translator in the audience. Buckley then stated, ""First person on the stage that speaks Spanish gets to do it."" Hillary's supporters shouted ""Dolores."" Dolores walked up to the stage.  People in the audience objected. ""no!"" ""neutral!"" ""she's a surrogate!""  Nevada Caucus Guidelines prevent observers and surrogates from speaking during the Caucus proceeding.  Rightfully, people in the audience were concerned that Huerta, a Clinton surrogate, might attempt to instruct Spanish speakers to group toward Clinton's area.  Precinct Chair Buckley noted the conflict and stated ""we are going forward English only.""  Buckley followed with the instructions, ""if somebody next to you is not English speaking please make sure you are next to them so you can translate as quickly as possible.""

**Re: Obama Boys 2008 vs Bernie Bros 2016**

This attack was first run by Clinton supporters against Obama in 2008, in an attempt to disparage the candidate and label their supporters as sexist mysoginists with racist connotations.{[1](http://dailykos.com/stories/2016/2/8/1481627/-WOW-Before-the-sexist-Bernie-Bro-Clinton-supporters-created-the-sexist-Obama-boy-No-seriously)}{[2](http://www.salon.com/2008/04/14/obama_supporters/)}

""Bernie Bros"" is a demeaning categorization for male Sanders supporters first penned in a Fall 2015 OP-ED. The BernieBros myth was further pushed into the sexist misogynist realm by Clinton supporters Emily Nussbaum and Emily Cahn.  Emily Nussbaum is a blogger/TV critic for ""The New Yorker"" and [a self-professed Clinton supporter](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216033537/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/691834775343087616); her father [is attorney Bernard Nussbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_W._Nussbaum), former white house counsel for Bill Clinton.

Emily Nussbaum [was labeled ""a psycho""](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040007/https://twitter.com/TJMitchJohnson/status/691839468710535168) by a single self-described Tea Party Trump supporter with a fake twitter account [@RepStevenSmith](https://twitter.com/RepStevenSmith). {[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a8Q0RYWGqM)}{[2](http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/01/31/greenwald-anti-sanders-bernie-bro-articles-based-on-parody-account/)}{[3](http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/in-the-know/199111-fake-congressman-fools-people-on-twitter)}. [@RussPMguy](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216040448/https://twitter.com/RussPMguy) is also a Trump supporter.

Emily [falsely attributed this troll attack](http://web.archive.org/web/20160216034042/https://twitter.com/emilynussbaum/status/693452999071526912) to Bernie supporters.
Clinton supporter Emily Cahn [repeated Nussbaum's account, falsely blaming Sanders supporters](http://mashable.com/2016/01/29/bernie-sanders-berniebros/).

""Bernie Bros"" does not exist, it was a troll.  But that isn't stopping the Clinton campaign from repeating the myth like they did in 2008 against Obama.

**Department of Commerce v. New York**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**

&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Gamble v. United States**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule the separate sovereigns exception to the double jeopardy clause.

**The American Legion v. American Humanist Association**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether a 93-year-old memorial to the fallen of World War I is unconstitutional merely because it is shaped like a cross; (2) whether the constitutionality of a passive display incorporating religious symbolism should be assessed under the tests articulated in Lemon v. Kurtzman, Van Orden v. Perry, Town of Greece v. Galloway or some other test; and (3) whether, if the test from Lemon v. Kurtzman applies, the expenditure of funds for the routine upkeep and maintenance of a cross-shaped war memorial, without more, amounts to an excessive entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment.

**Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court conducted a proper holistic analysis of the majority-minority Virginia House of Delegates districts under the prior decision in this case, Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, even though it ignored a host of evidence, including the overwhelming majority of district lines, which were carried over unchanged from the prior map; the geographic location of population disparities, which imposed severe redistricting constraints and directly impacted which voters were moved into and out of the majority-minority districts; and the degree of constraint the Houses Voting Rights Act compliance goals imposed in implementation, which was minimal; (2) whether the Bethune-Hill predominance test is satisfied merely by a lengthy description of ordinary Voting Rights Act compliance measures; (3) whether the district court erred in relying on expert analysis it previously rejected as unreliable and irrelevant and expert analysis that lacked any objective or coherent methodology; (4) whether the district court committed clear error in ignoring the entirety of the houses evidentiary presentation under the guise of credibility determinations unsupported by the record and predicated on expert testimony that should not have been credited or even admitted; (5) whether Virginias choice to draw 11 safe majority-minority districts of around or above 55 percent black voting-age population (BVAP) was narrowly tailored in light of the discretion the Voting Rights Act afforded covered jurisdictions to choose to create a certain number of safe districts, in which it is highly likely that minority voters will be able to elect the candidate of their choice, under Georgia v. Ashcroft, or the requirement the Voting Rights Act, as amended, imposed on covered jurisdictions to prove the absence of racially polarized voting to justify BVAP reductions towards or below 50 percent BVAP; (6) whether the district court erred in ignoring the district-specific evidence before the house in 2011 justifying safe districts at or above 55 percent BVAP; and (7) whether appellants have standing to bring this appeal.

**Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck**

&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in rejecting the Supreme Courts state actor tests and instead creating a per se rule that private operators of public access channels are state actors subject to constitutional liability; and (2) whether the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit erred in holdingcontrary to the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 6th and District of Columbia Circuitsthat private entities operating public access television stations are state actors for constitutional purposes where the state has no control over the private entitys board or operations.

**Flowers v. Mississippi**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Mississippi Supreme Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky in this case.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**

&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule Auer v. Robbins and Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

**Iancu v. Brunetti**

&gt;Issue: Whether Section 2(a) of the Lanham Acts prohibition on the federal registration of immoral or scandalous marks is facially invalid under the free speech clause of the First Amendment.

Orders begin at 9:30am EST, with the possibility of opinions at 10:00am EST.

There are **8** pending cases to potentially be decided by ruling today, including:

**Department of Commerce v. New York**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether the district court erred in enjoining the secretary of the Department of Commerce from reinstating a question about citizenship to the 2020 decennial census on the ground that the secretarys decision violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq; (2) whether, in an action seeking to set aside agency action under the APA, a district court may order discovery outside the administrative record to probe the mental processes of the agency decisionmaker -- including by compelling the testimony of high-ranking executive branch officials -- without a strong showing that the decisionmaker disbelieved the objective reasons in the administrative record, irreversibly prejudged the issue, or acted on a legally forbidden basis; and (3) whether the secretarys decision to add a citizenship question to the decennial census violated the enumeration clause of the U.S. Constitution.

**Lamone v. Benisek**
&gt;Issue: In case in which the plaintiffs allege that a Maryland congressional district was gerrymandered to retaliate against them for their political views: (1) whether the various legal claims articulated by the three-judge district court are unmanageable; (2) whether the three-judge district court erred when, in granting plaintiffs motion for summary judgment, it resolved disputes of material fact as to multiple elements of plaintiffs claims, failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and treated as undisputed evidence that is the subject of still-unresolved hearsay and other evidentiary objections; and (3) whether the three-judge district court abused its discretion in entering an injunction despite the plaintiffs years-long delay in seeking injunctive relief, rendering the remedy applicable to at most one election before the next decennial census necessitates another redistricting.

**Rucho v. Common Cause**
&gt;Issues: (1) Whether plaintiffs have standing to press their partisan gerrymandering claims; (2) whether plaintiffs partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable; and (3) whether North Carolinas 2016 congressional map is, in fact, an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

**Kisor v. Wilkie**
&gt;Issue: Whether the Supreme Court should overrule [Auer v. Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auer_v._Robbins) and [Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/325/410/), which direct courts to defer to an agencys reasonable interpretation of its own ambiguous regulation.

The Federal Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

###UPDATES:

**US v. Haymond**

The 10th Circuit's ruling is vacated and remanded.

[Opinion](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-1672_5hek.pdf)

The court holds that a federal law requiring a defendant who is registered as a sex offender to return to prison for at least five years if a federal judge finds that the defendant violated the terms of his supervised release is unconstitutional.

* * * * * * * * * *

**Tennessee Wine &amp; Spirits vs. Thomas**

The Supreme Court affirms the Sixth Circuit's ruling, which struck down the residency requirement.

It's also on [my blog](http://www.fbesp.org/synapse/?p=110).

18 February 2011

Dr. Culver and Ms. Heipp,

I must confess to expressing a falsehood recently. When I learned that a collective day of action was being planned for Thursday 17 February, I logged into the AESOP system to register my absence. I am woefully ignorant about reimbursable days and the like, so I did not attempt to request a Leave Without Stated Reason (as some of my colleagues did). I saw no option for Protest Against Illegitimate Attempt to Revoke Fundamental Rights by State Legislature, so instead I stated that the reason was Illness. But I was not sick.

I could pretend that I really was sick yesterday. Given my history of chronic insomnia (which, I am learning, is woefully common among my colleagues) and resulting illness, I probably could obtain a note from my doctor testifying to a legitimate absence. But I will not do this, because I have too much respect for the intelligence of SPHS and SPASD administrators.

Yesterday I went to the Wisconsin State Capitol building to protest against Governor Scott Walkers budget proposal, which would (among other things) abolish the right of state workers to collectively bargain. I went because I consider this proposal a fundamental violation of our rights and dignity as hard-working people. **As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said in 1937: The right to bargain collectively is at the bottom of social justice for the worker, as well as the sensible conduct of business affairs. The denial or observance of this right means the difference between despotism and democracy.**

I did not make this decision lightly. As my students and colleagues will affirm, I approach the act of teaching with a passion and reverence usually associated with monastic devotion. Despite the elimination of funding for the SPHS Go Club last year, I continue to offer practice sessions and after-school meetings regularly, without pay. I worked tirelessly to develop and implement the new Interdisciplinary Poetics course several years ago, with very positive results. And, like all of my colleagues, I spend countless hours outside of the regular contract day grading papers and preparing for upcoming classes.

Teaching is not simply a job for me. I need contact with young people. I need to tell them about how writing liberates, about the value of literature, about why East Timor matters. I need to explain to them (loudly) why *Transformers* is a bad movie. I need to tell them silly jokes and remind them that they are glorious manifestations of their ancestors dreams.

I will understand if my pay for Thursday is withheld. Fortunately I have no dependent children or significant debt which compels me to scrape and save each penny that I receive. I also understand that my AESOP prevarication was an affront to the trust between employer and employee. I understand that I must now work to rebuild that trust. (Though I hope the many trust deposits I have made during the past eight years will help.)

However, I ask for mercy as the school and district consider disciplinary action. Had this day of protest been concerned with mere dollars, I would have certainly been in front of my classroom as always. As my students are reading right now in Lorraine Hansberrys play *A Raisin in the Sun*, Mama tells her son Walter that money is not life. Once upon a time, she says, freedom used to be life.

It was in the spirit of freedom and our rights as people that I made the difficult decision to abandon my position as educator for one day. I humbly apologize to the parents and families that had to scramble for supervision or daycare when the doors of SPHS were suddenly closed. I know that my actions have made the lives of other people more difficult, and I ask for their understanding.

But as the old saying goes, an injustice to one is an injustice to all. I believe that we who protested at the state capitol were doing so not only for ourselves  nor for public employees  but for all working people in our state, in our nation. As my sign at the protest said: The state could also save money by abolishing our right to vote, right? But this would be unfair. I expect you would protest if the government tried to abolish this right of yours.

And I would be right beside you.

(TLDR: You cannot possibly hope to understand the vital complexities of our struggle if you're not willing to read more. Please stop looking for shortcuts.)","politics",190,"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/foi8h/from_a_wisconsin_teacher_why_i_skipped_school_on/"

Update: Finishing up edits on a story  will begin answering questions around 4:10 ET

The Supreme Court [completed its annual term](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-cases-affirmative-action-free-speech-student-debt-91549085?st=vd4syxyjl53xw98) on June 30, ending a[half century of affirmative action](https://www.wsj.com/articles/affirmative-action-key-dates-cec126a8?st=vfbkakyme1en682) in college admissions, [curbing gay rights](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-rules-web-designer-can-refuse-work-on-same-sex-wedding-announcements-f1e55d02?st=recdrhw8x54f7sy) when they clashed with religious objectors and [canceling President Biden's plan to forgive student debt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-strikes-down-bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-54a1ca7?st=ebceq0tkf6vqsov) owed by 40 million Americans.

But while this was a deeply conservative court, Chief Justice John Roberts took pains to show his was not a partisan court. The justices sided in some areas with the White House against policy challenges from Republican-led states, and rejected separate lawsuits that would have boosted GOP election chances in 2024 and beyond, refusing to roll back Voting Rights Act protections for minority voters and declining to block state courts from reviewing congressional gerrymanders.

They Say They Need It.","Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/us/affirmative-action-admissions-supreme-court.html?referringSource=articleShare

It has been more than 15 years since two of the countrys top public university systems, the University of Michigan and the University of California, were forced to stop using affirmative action in admissions.

Since then, both systems have tried to build racially diverse student bodies through extensive outreach and major financial investment, well into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Those efforts have fallen abysmally short, the universities admitted in two amicus briefs filed this month at the Supreme Court, which is set to consider the future of affirmative action in college admissions this fall.

Among the data points: In 2021, the entering freshman class at the University of California, Berkeley, included 258 Black students and 27 Native American students out of a class of 6,931. That same year, Black enrollment at Michigans flagship campus in Ann Arbor was 4 percent, even as the university maintained a special admissions office in Detroit to recruit Black students.

The outreach programs are extremely costly. The University of California system says it has spent more than a half-billion dollars since 2004 to increase diversity among its students.

In the briefs, lawyers for the universities argue that, without affirmative action, achieving racial diversity is virtually impossible at highly selective universities.

Despite persistent, vigorous and varied efforts to increase student body racial and ethnic diversity by race-neutral means, the brief from Michigan stated, the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minority students have fallen precipitously in many of U-Ms schools and colleges since the end of affirmative action.

Justin Driver, a professor at Yale Law School, said the stories of California and Michigan illustrate the fallout that can take place when affirmative action is banned in admissions.

Despite incredibly valiant, sustained efforts to navigate the realities of a post-affirmative action world, the flagship campuses in California and Michigan have been unsuccessful in enrolling members of marginalized racial groups, said Mr. Driver, who is considered an expert on the impact of the high courts education decisions.

The Supreme Court is scheduled on Oct. 31 to hear the lawsuits brought by the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions that challenge the race-conscious methods that Harvard and the University of North Carolina use to pick freshman classes.

The organization says that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans and that North Carolina gives an admissions boost to underserved racial minorities. And the group argues in its own brief, filed this week, that ending affirmative action nationwide would help improve diversity at the University of California and the University of Michigan, because they could better compete with universities who currently use race.

With the Supreme Courts recent shift to the right, the affirmative action cases could upset 40 years of precedent that says race can be considered as one factor in determining university admission.

Such a shift could have significant implications for universities, many of which have argued that diverse environments enhance learning by exposing students to a variety of perspectives.

Affirmative action is banned by local edict in nine states, including Michigan and California. Some states without affirmative action programs, like Oklahoma, have taken the opposite position in briefs to the court, arguing that the University of Oklahoma remains just as diverse today (if not more so) than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. Thirteen other states joined the Oklahoma brief.

Oklahomas freshman class in 2020, according to data released by the university, was 61 percent white, 12 percent Hispanic, 3.7 percent Black and 2.1 percent American Indian. The states brief points out that a large number of students identified as two or more races and that the number of those who were part Black would increase the Black percentage to more than 6 percent. Black residents make up 7.8 percent of the states population.

A brief filed by last year by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, also takes the side of Students for Fair Admissions, arguing against race-conscious admissions, even though the University of Texas uses a form of them.

The brief criticizes not only affirmative action, but diversity itself, stating, Indeed, the very justifications for diversity require invidious racial stereotyping.

Michigan and California are both known for highly rated schools that receive thousands of applications from across the country. With admissions extremely competitive, applicants from underrepresented groups face higher obstacles to enrollment.

At the University of Michigan, a voter referendum known as Proposal 2, Affirmative Action Initiative, was adopted in 2006, resulting in a state constitutional ban on race-conscious admissions. That prompted sharp drops in enrollment of Black and Native American students. Since then, Michigan has worked to diversify its student body through outreach programs.

They include a college advising corps of young Michigan alumni, as well as a recruitment office in nearby Detroit, a predominantly Black city. Additional incentives include generous scholarships.

Calling Proposal 2 an involuntary experiment imposed on the university and acknowledging that its diversity profile has since suffered, a Michigan spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald, said that the universitys experience should serve as a cautionary tale that underscores the compelling need for selective universities to be able to consider race as one of many background factors about applicants.

Black undergraduate enrollment declined to 4 percent in 2021 from 7 percent in 2006, the brief said, even as the total percentage of college-age African Americans in Michigan increased to 19 percent from 16 percent. At the same time, Native American enrollment, once as high as 1 percent, dropped to 0.11 percent in 2021, the brief said.

Whats more, fully one-quarter of underrepresented students surveyed felt they did not belong at Michigan, a 66 percent increase in a decade, the brief said.

At Michigans Ross School of Business, Rita Brooks was one of 74 Black students among the 2,421 undergraduates enrolled in 2021.

While Im thankful for the incredible resources and the education, its difficult to ignore the isolation felt in classroom settings where youre one of two Black students at the most, said Ms. Brooks, who is from the Detroit area.

Some prospective students have said they view the low undergraduate Black enrollment at Michigan as a reason to go elsewhere, illustrating how low numbers can further deter the enrollment of students of color.

Aniya Caldwell, of Jackson, Mich., was president of her high schools National Honor Society in 2020, but she chose to attend Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington, D.C.

The diversity at the University of Michigan is minuscule, Ms. Caldwell said in a LinkedIn message. Overall, I chose to go to Howard because I knew Id be surrounded by people of color and not have to worry about additional racism and discrimination.

In California, Proposition 209 was adopted in 1996, banning racial preferences in admissions. By the fall of 2006, there were 96 Black students in a freshman class of nearly 5,000 at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The Black enrollment figure was so low that it shocked the U.C.L.A. community, resulting in the groups nickname  the Infamous 96.

Since then, enrollment of underserved minorities in the California system has partially recovered. For example, U.C.L.A.s Black enrollment, 7 percent before Proposition 209 was adopted, fell to 3.43 percent in 1998. By 2019, it had increased to 5.98 percent. Californias population is 6.5 percent Black.

But lawyers for the University of California system describe an uphill battle to achieve diversity, particularly at the most highly selective schools.

While 52 percent of Californias public high school students identify as Hispanic, 15 percent of freshmen at Berkeley identified as Hispanic, with the figure at the systems nine campuses overall standing at 25 percent.

Many students from underrepresented minority groups, particularly those at the U.C.s most selective campuses, will often find themselves the sole student of their race in a class, the brief said.

Olufemi Ogundele, dean of undergraduate admissions at Berkeley, said he was incredibly proud of the schools progress in admissions despite the ban on considering race. But he added, Theres no doubt in my mind that we would be making much more significant progress if we were able to consider the entire human or the entire student.

At another selective school in the system, the University of California, San Diego, 3 percent of undergraduate students are Black, and some of them have complained about racist incidents.

While the brief focuses only on the University of California system, diversity at other four-year public colleges in California also has declined, according to yet another brief filed with the court by a group of California civil rights and legal organizations.

By 2018, the percentage of Black students enrolled at any California State University was half that in 1997, dropping to 4 percent from 8 percent, the brief said.

Native American students enrolled in any campus of California State Universitys system fell to 0.2 percent in 2018 from 1.23 percent in 1995.","education",24,"https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/wyeqsi/nytimes_affirmative_action_was_banned_at_two_top/"

After much debate and an unsuccessful vote, the state instead opted to double down on slavery. The lasting lesson taken from Turners revolt? An educated Black person was a dangerous Black person. Throughout the 1830s, Virginia and other southern states began enacting and expanding legislation making it illegal not only for slaves to learn to read, but for free citizens  Black and white  to teach them to read.

In short, racial subjugation is not an unintended consequence of the United States educational structure, it is an integral purpose of that structure.

Its that history that the United States Supreme Courts six conservative justices at best ignored, and at worst chose to perpetuate in striking down race based affirmative action in college admissions via the cases of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina.

Central to this study, aside from exposing the fbi as criminally insane, is to briefly describe their peripheral supporters in the general population, including the media and all departments of government, and others.
*
https://www.academia.edu/29056259/The_fbi_Their_Agents_Operatives_And_Friends_Are_Seriously_Mentally_Ill

All who benefit or profit from government atrocities, such as most doctors and 'well off' individuals, are often contemptuous of anyone who criticises the fbi/police community. Such friends of the established authority generally hold that the government can do no wrong and that law enforcement particularly are immune from real accountability because of the presumed danger of their activities. The 'government right or wrong mentality' is an implied admission by 'true believers'  of the criminality and infirmity in  their own minds and in the collective conscience of the  general population.

The *list of sociopathic  characteristics shown below exactly applies to those fbi and police agents, operatives and street thugs sent to assault me everywhere. One should note that some of these fbi hoodlums  are serial killers, serial torturers and just plain homicidal psychopaths who find  an exhilarating and comfortable  home with many benefits in the fbi. So, the reader might see here that their support for the crimes committed by government agents and police may be attributable  (right or wrong) to the people. In fact many citizens readily  cooperate with fbi psychopaths in assaulting me.

As for all others in society who support the fbi and police community, the evidence is clear that our society is dominated by quasi evil people who have no regard for those of us who are targeted for termination by cops and fbi. In other words we live in a kind of war zone here in USA where the occupying forces are the fbi,police,cia, and many in  the general population. See my reports on the fbi As living Dead and see perhaps your profile alongside of theirs.

Furthermore, in order for some citizens to avoid any conflict with the serial killers in the police community, most people who otherwise are decent and caring, present an appearance of 'disinterested' in the atrocities going on all around them. They pretend that all is well in heaven and on earth. NOT TRUE!

So, reports such as mine and others who are being secretly tortured, maimed and killed by stealth are easily ignored and dismissed by almost everyone. This harmful apathy returns ultimately to haunt our society because the evil that many of us report does not stop when we the victims die, nor when the killers die. Instead their evil 'lives after them' and is perpetuated and institutionalized  across our society and around the globe. Such inhumane actions that I outline in my reports coupled with   feigned ignorance thereof by our fellow citizens ensure that public policy favors a violent, unconscionable and monstrous culture orchestrated to control all. In this  culture of popular  indifference to the unnecessary suffering and bad deaths of people by fbi/police/vigilante death teams, all seems acceptable to our sociopathic neighbors until they discover  that, WOW, ""...and ""Then They Came For Me.""

http://www.indymedia.org.nz/articles/6433


As our fellow citizens show no interest in nor accept any responsibility for the crimes against humanity perpetrated in their name and on their behalf by government, I forsee a very dirty response globally from people with a different view of human progress and civilization. USA's unconscionable crime spree, unprecented in human affairs, cannot obtain.

Here is a picture in words of the character of individuals in  government, including congress, administrative agencies, &amp; courts (especially federal Magistrate Judges), and this same composite  now also depicts many, perhaps most,  in our society.

Has an emotional need to justify their crimes and therefore needs their victim's affirmation (respect). See fbi's message to me demanding 'respect': http://www.sosbeevfbi.com/hatemail-partten.html

Ultimate goal is the creation of a willing victim ( I have frustrated both the fbi goal and evil intent)

Incapable of real human attachment to another

Unable to feel remorse or guilt, even as their psychopaths force suicide while monitoring their victims.

Extreme narcissism and grandiose demeanor, traits that I have witnessed in many of their assassins who assault me.

May state readily that their goal is to rule the world, and see my 'World in A Box' to discover that their goal is on track today.

A[ new study](http://www.ceousa.org/attachments/article/624/Oklahoma_Study.pdf) contradicts claims by the University of Oklahoma that minority students do not receive preferential admissions treatment.

Black and Native American students who were admitted to the university were less qualified than their peers from other ethnic groups, according to the study, which was released by the Center for Equal Opportunity in Virginia.

The findings were most striking for OUs graduate programs. White students admitted to the law school had a median LSAT score of 159 and a median GPA of 3.60. In contrast, black students were admitted with a median LSAT score of 153 and a median GPA of 3.34. Native Americans scored better than blacks, but still demonstrably worse than white or Asian students.

According to the study: OU Law rejected 2 American Indians, 9 Asian Americans, 1 African American, 8 Hispanics, and 105 whites despite higher test scores and grades compared to the median African American admittee.

{snip}

We looked at not only undergraduate but also medical school and law school admissions, and we found the same pattern at all three schools, he said in an interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation. Namely, preferential treatment for African American applicants, and to a lesser extent, preferential treatment for American Indian applicants.

But the university has denied granting admissions based on race, and rejects the studys findings. An OU spokesperson expressed disappointment with CEOs methodology, in a[ statement](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Study-suggests-racial-preferences-in-place-at-OU-3971828.php#ixzz2AFVpvAdh).

It is unfortunate that the university was not contacted or provided an opportunity to participate in the CEO study, said Catherine Bishop, an OU spokesperson, in a statement. Had the university been contacted, we might have been able to clarify items that seem to be misunderstood by those who prepared the report.

Whether or not OU uses racial preferences is a timely question for Oklahoma voters, who will consider banning affirmative action at all public institutions when they go to the polls on Nov. 6. {snip}

Excerpts:

&gt; Of the 27 U.S. urban school districts that reported their results for 2019from Boston and Chicago to Fort Worth, Texas, and Los Angelesnot a single one can say a majority of the black eighth graders in their care are proficient in either math or reading.
***
In a number of these school districts, proficiency rates for black eighth graders are down in the single digits (see Detroits 4% for math and 5% for reading, or Milwaukees 5% for math and 7% for reading). Most are in the low teens.
***
...the countrys best results are still pretty rotten. Charlotte, N.C., is way ahead of the rest of the pack with 24% of its black eighth graders proficient in math. For reading, Boston took the top slot at 20%
***
Of the 100 largest public school systems (based on enrollment), the six that spent the most per pupil in FY 2019 were the New York City School District in New York ($28,004), Boston City Schools in Massachusetts ($25,653), Washington Schools in the District of Columbia ($22,406), San Francisco Unified in California ($17,228), Atlanta School District in Georgia ($17,112), and Seattle Public Schools in Washington ($16,543)

&gt; San Francisco and Seattle arent part of the Trial Urban District Assessment districts reporting their scores. But the other four are, and their scores for black achievement are as bad as the rest.

Urban public school districts have given up on their core mission: to provide children, i.e., to teach and inculcate them, with the knowledge and skills required to become successful and productive adults. Is there another explanation for this failure other than systemic racism?

If he had ever realized how the intelligent people like us on the left think about his unwillingness to parse the truth from falsehood that he does so willfully, he could refrain from sending tweets with total disregard of our vast knowledge.

And as per an article by Julie Hirschfeld Davis in NYT today saying,""In a Fox-Inspired Tweetstorm, Trump Offers a Medley of Falsehoods and Misstatements"", she literally spelled out all the lies and braggadocio of our illegitimate president in tweets after tweets with horrendously misspelled words. 

It should be noted here that the foreign policy ideas in all the false tweets that he sent to his millions of supporters came from the hosts of Fox Tv. who're actually deciding our foreign policy since most of the earlier real diplomats are missing in the State Dept. due to Trump's cost cutting misadventures.

Trump, who watches Fox Tv. every morning for eight hours in his pajamas, tweets and retweets with his ""small"" hands as per Marco Rubio, anything he hears on the Morning show without using his own judgement which is nil to begin with.

And as per another editorial in today's NYT called, ""America Started Over Once. Can We Do It Again ?"", the editors in the paper literally trashed Trump's latest executive action doing away with the Affirmative actions in school and college admissions. 

The ""Fourteenth Amendment"" that they highlighted in the same editorial, is an epitome of our constitution which corrected the flaws in our Bill of Rights which was ""a deeply self-contradictory document"" because the slave owning founders never talked about freedom for the slaves which they themselves owned by the thousands.

Although they talked a lot about ""human equality as supreme and a fundamental premise of their new nation"" but they never wanted to give the status of citizenship to the millions of slaves they and their White citizens owned as the same editors mentioned in their piece.

But now as Trump trying to topple the 13th,14th and 15th Amendments to the Constitution on its face by rejecting the Affirmative Action in the admission process in our schools and colleges that Justice Kennedy fought so hard to maintain all by his own efforts beside maintaining Gay Rights. 

As we recall that in 1992 Mr. Kennedy also maintained the rights of women to choose abortion or life that the earlier Supreme Court legalized in 1973 under Roe v. Wade.

So Trump's desire to do away with everything that this country achieved in more than 300 years of its independence, is totally criminal in nature, for which he should be prosecuted by the congress and the current Supreme Court with eight Justices since Justice Kennedy already submitted his letter of resignation to Trump.

For those unaware or only partially in the know about whats happening in Texas, the GOP has unified control of the State government, which theyre using to try to pass the most nakedly political, implicitly racist, and 1950s-esque restrictive voting rights bill called the Election Integrity and Security Act. Theyve been working on it since March, recently reformed and reconciled it, so that its ready for Floor Action in the House& the final step before it goes to Gov. Abbotts desk. 

Democrats cant filibuster it, except by denying the House a quorum, or total number of electors necessary, to proceed. The governor threatened to have them detained by the Rangers and forced into the House. So, they fled the State en masse to prevent this bill from passing, unable/unwilling to return until the GOP drops this awful bill. 

So why is it so awful that House members are willing to leave their jobs and loved ones for potentially months? Here are five reason why&

**1. Sunday Early Voting would now be limited to only 1pm-9pm** 

If that seems innocuous, at first, Let me explain how its some explicitly racist BS meant to decrease minority turnout. Church is big in Texas, whether youre white or black, but in many black communities the church often also serves as a focal point for the community (Im white, so if Im wrong, please lmk& but it doesnt affect this next part). Theres an operation in Texas, and all over the South, called Souls to the Polls, where following services, buses would  take the congregation straight to an early polling site. Church services DO NOT end at 1pm. They end much earlier. Its one of the most effective means of driving black voter turnout, and the RNC intentionally and capriciously wants to end it with this unjustifiable change thats a Prima Facie example of 21st century racism. 

 **NOTE** this language goes back to SB7, which was overwhelmingly supported but faced a media backlash and is tenuously constitutional. The most recent version to be voted on, SB7, has excluded this particular language (except granting the county election clerk of &lt;30k counties flexibility in setting hours if there isnt a signed petition). 

HOWEVER, the GOP doesnt roll over that easily, this bill would still change the definition of early voting place to mean an office regularly maintained for conducting general clerical functions of the county clerk, and would disallow parties from requesting temporary polling sites; giving the counties total discretion over their location. If the county is GOP controlled, you bet those sites will be far away from the nearest church. 

**2) BANS DRIVE-THRU VOTING**

Unlike #1 this language survives in SB1. A polling site MAY NOT be located in a tent or any temporary site. If you want to vote from your car, you must a) be alone and b) have a valid medical reason to do so. 

Drive-thru voting was overwhelmingly used by democratic voters in 2020. Especially in cities. Thats why the GOP fought tooth and nail to get the court to grant an injunction against their use in Harris County.

Just another way of making voting more difficult. 

**3) public officials CANNOT send unsolicited vote-by-mail applications**

The early voting clerk may make no attempt to solicit a person to complete an application
for an early voting ballot by mail, whether directly or through a third party. This is a trend in red states. In 2020, the majority of States, and several counties in Texas, proactively sent vote-by-mail applications. Well, as you can guess, Texas wasnt happy with the whopping 973,000 ballots (out of like 13m) they received by mail. They dont release party ID numbers, but you can guess which way these ballots leaned (there wouldve been even more if Harris Countys conservative election judge hadnt shot down the countys plan to do so). Now, no county can send out ballots proactively, not even to those over 65 (GOPs loss if passed as is). 

So, an applicant must submit an application, signing it with **ink on paper**, and stating his/her grounds for needing to vote by mail. They would make that more difficult too. In the past, youd merely state something like compromised immune system or risk of illness from polling site. This bill would require either the name of your hospital or the affirmation of a witness of the 2nd degree (so not your mom). As well, in the space right before your signature you must write I certify that the information given in this application is true, and I understand that giving false information in this application is a crime."" 

Their goal is obviously to limit vote by mail as much as possible. *Interestingly*, the new text does allow for a political party or a candidate for voting office [to] distribute an application form for an early ballot to a person who did not request an application. Perhaps theyre worried about 1A claims, or more cynically, this would allow the GOP to reach those 65+ voters who are certainly eligible. 

In a Trumpian nod to the Big Lie, there is a ton of new language about the illegality of vote harvesting. If a party or pac pays you to collect early vote ballots from nursing homes, youd now be committing a felony, as well as open yourself up to civil liability- meaning the opposing party could sue you for damages. We all know how rampant this was in 2020, with Soros funded Dem agents pressuring or even just filling out old peoples ballots, thank gd for this much needed language /s. 

Lastly, all vote-by-mail ballots would be subject to diligent signature verification. The envelope signature needs to match the ballot signature which needs to match your application signature and the drivers license copy you submitted. Something tells me Johnny Flynn III will have a whole lot easier time than Marshawn Brown getting through this ridiculous verification process. Which is to say, its another example of racism and voter suppression. 

**4) Protects The Rights and Repeals Restrictions on Poll Watchers/Observers**

This isnt talked about enough. Theres no test or certificate program one needs to do to become a poll watcher. Theyre merely appointed by their party. And as we saw in 2020, in the case of Trumps Observers and Watchers, you couldnt find a dumber, ruder, more self-entitled group of schmucks if you visited Disneyland on Senior Skip day. 

In the past, election officers had the upper hand when it came to these people. *Reasonable* access was enough, so they couldnt crowd you while youre counting and they could dismiss you if you were out of hand. Youd think after the harassment these vote counters were subjected to in 2020, wed be strengthening laws protecting them. 

This bill would go the other way. It would make it a Class A misdemeanor for an election official refuses full access to a watcher. *Reasonable* would be stricken, and watchers would be guaranteed free movement and stand near enough to see and hear the election officials conducting their official activities. The watcher must be given access to watch the vote tallies be transferred to the data storage device, and then are free to follow the election materials from the regional to the central location or wherever final tabulation occurs. If an election official tries to create distance b/w the watcher and the vote tabulation, they would possibly be committing another offense. 

But dont worry, the watcher takes an oath not to harass anyone /s. 

**5) Attempts to Limit Checks and Balances**

A public official may not create, alter, modify, waive, or suspend any election standard, practice, or procedure mandated by law or rule in a manner not expressly authorized by this code.

Gd forbid something like covid happens again& say, like, a county-wide blackout caused by the failing, aging energy system that Abbott and the Legislature **should** be dealing with rather than this BS& the GOP doesnt want Democratic friendly district and county judges imposing voter friendly rules like they did in some places in 2020.

**Gov Abbott Dialed up the Pressure By Vetoing Salaries for All Legislature Members and Their Staffs. Beginning SEPTEMBER 1st, No More Paychecks For Anyone 

This is some  [Bat Shit Crazy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/18/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats/amp/)[bat shit crazy](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/06/18/greg-abbott-veto-legislature-democrats/amp/) stuff. Facially, it seems like a pretty evident abuse of power, with the Executive Branch impinging on the rights and duties of the Legislature. But idk Texas law, and should it survive, and should the stalemate continue, the consequences of this are potentially dire.  

The special legislative session ends August 6, but that date is meaningless, as Abbott has virtually unlimited power to keep calling 30 day special sessions. Hes hinted his intent to do so, leaving Texas Dems effectively homeless. For the most part, theyve been in DC- agitating for the Federal government to pass the For the People Voting Act, which would block most of what Texas hopes to achieve (Congress would have to end the filibuster to do so, and they dont have the support to do so =-[ ). The stakes are high, the Texas Dems are being cheered on, Abbott shows no sign of backing down. This thing could drag out for awhile. 

When we hit 09/01/21- house and senate electors will stop being paid their $7,200 yearly salaries, with only GOP and present Dem members receiving their $220 per diem when in session. Some of these guys are independently rich, others have second jobs, which hopefully many of them can do remotely (but they tend to be lawyers so, not sure). 

Its not really the electors Im worried about& its the 2,000+ staffers on both side of the aisle. 

The median salary for a House Staffer is $36,000, the lowest paid make just $1,200. Median for the Senate is $44,661, with the lowest paid at $4,160. And these being medians, I imagine young, newer aides make half that. [Source](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/How-much-do-Texas-legislators-make-A-look-at-16222302.php)

Abbott is literally trying to starve them out. House members will be fine; Im sure they can obtain a personal loan from a DNC backer or find a way to treat personal expenditures as politically related. But they care about their staff and the best theyd be able to do for em is lay them off so they can apply for Texas crappy unemployment. 

Thank you to those who have read my post up to this point. I know I wasnt brief but I hope I laid out the stakes, the courage of these 51 Texas Dems, and a potentially looming pitfall in their strategy. I am not even that strong democrat, but anyone who has read the original or updated bill (and either could still pass, technically) can tell its an attack on America. What the GOPs proposing is downright evil. Its basically the legislative equivalent of gerrymandering. Both the GOP state and National party recognize the shifting demographics that could turn Texas blue in 4-8 years, and they are committed to ensuring that cant happen with this restrictive voting bill. Its a slap in the face to the Democratic Texas party apparatus that has worked so hard over the last decade, and more importantly, its a slap in the face to democracy. 

How can you help? Im not sure. Ive never done something like this before, myself. What I hope to do, ideally, is take Abbotts salary slasher chess piece off the table. Prevent his tactic by organizing some sort of a gofundme or something thru actblue that would take up a collection to serve as a backstop for those Texas Democratic house/senate staff who lose their salaries on September 1st, and could really use the help. 

If you have any experience, or any ideas, or just want to help& please reach out. And keep spreading the word about Texas. This is democracys Alamo.","democrats",3,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/on9zbv/not_so_brief_recapprimer_on_the_highstakes_fight/"

"2015-10-15",1444921236,"Who won the debate? Be specific and cite your sources.","I'm getting very tired of this back and forth about who won the debate. Publications are saying Clinton without a doubt, online polls are saying Sanders, and no one is mentioning O'Malley unless they mention his looks. There has to be a more objective way to really understand who won.

Things to consider in terms of judging are:

* Quality of answers in terms of details

* Delivery versus incoherence

* ""Being Presidential""

* Exceeding expectations

* Excitement

* Policy positions

With all this, in mind, I will give my opinion.

I, a definite Hillary supporter, actually thought after the debate was over the winner of the debate was O'Malley. He had the strongest opening and closing statements. He was perfectly progressive and spoke well about his past experiences. His one fault was that he didn't provide the best vision of what an O'Malley administration would be doing but I think that's why he's clamoring for so many more debates. This was his first real time to get in front of America and in doing so, he showed Presidential chops. To me, he far exceeded the performance that his polling numbers would have you expect.

In second place, I think Hillary came a very close second to O'Malley. She had the benefit of more speaking time and with it did great. She showed her intelligence and experience which I think we all expected. What I didn't expect was how well she handled her attacks. At various points, the focus was on her whether it was her hawkish foreign policy or her Wall Street ties and I think she defended them beautifully. She didn't shirk from it, explained her reasoning behind her positions, and ultimately stood her ground. This might not have convinced you to vote for her but it showed some serious Presidential cojones which I was glad to see. She certainly could've done even better considering everyone knew she was going to be attacked at some point but still she did well. She slightly exceeded the expectation I had for her, even as a supporter.

Sanders to me came in third. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't bad; he just wasn't amazing. His performance was exactly what I expected from him. Most of his answers centered around Wall Street greed, business-government ties, and education which is what he always says. However, he even answered in these ways in some foreign policy questions and what not. It just seemed like he was oversimplifying the role of the President. I also think he absolutely, 100% stumbled on the gun question. He knew it was going to be brought up and he was unable to defend it clearly. Does he support gun control or does he not because he's from a rural state? Even O'Malley came at him and mentioned that Maryland is rural too and he was able to pass legislation. This was one of the moments where I saw ""Bernie the *politician*"" come out versus ""Bernie the people's man."" I was waiting for Bernie to blow me away and quite frankly, he didn't even one bit. One thing I will give him a lot of credit for, as a non-Democrat (he's independent after all) he seems to want to heal the party more than I'd ever expect. 

Chaffee was fourth. The guy was just too rehearsed. He wasn't necessarily bad in his answers, with the exception of why he voted yes on Glass-Steagall (it was your first day?), but they all sounded like an automated answering machine. I never thought I'd see the perfect personification of stale bread on a televised debate.

Jim Webb. Oh, man, my heart goes out to you. You seem like a good guy but you are just a tad lost. Worst yet, you couldn't even defend how it is that you got to where you are. That ""biggest enemy"" answer was chilling. I felt I was filling in answers for you. Affirmative action? I got what you were saying (not that I necessarily 100% agree) but why do I have to feel like I'm in the spin room instead of just watching as a concerned citizen? 

Last but not least, Joe Biden. It's like you weren't even there!!

Anyways, I know this might be a bit long and I have a feeling I know what most people's answers are going to be. However, I'm more curious about how you got to your opinion and why. I don't care much for answers like ""Sanders was just a cranky man. Not Presidential AT ALL"" nor do I want to see any ""Hillary: why da fuck you lyin? Why you always lying?"" 

Come with substance. Come with the political insights I expect you all to have. Come with quotes from the debate itself.

Back in 2008, I was only 17, and clearly unable to vote in the elections, but I supported Obama because he was pro-gay (a direct issue for my personal liberty), he wanted healthcare for all Americans, and he promised to end the wars and shut down Guantanamo (something that I had found horrifying to exist).

Anyways, after he assassinated American citizen without due process, his failure to close Guantanamo, and now his efforts to stay in Afghanistan for another 2years, I don't feel as enthusiastic as I did four years ago. In fact the only reason I would vote for him, is because I wouldn't want Romney to win (who has a terrible time relating to the non-wealthy), I wouldn't want Santorum to win (clearly, an idiot), and I don't want Gingrich to win (I'm not a homophobic, racist southerner)... in fact I voted Ron Paul in the primaries simply because he was the most liberal candidate I found (other than his weird economic policies, but I compromised those feelings with the basis that congress would never allow that to be passed in a budget or law).

I'm almost compelled not to take part in voting for either of the two parties. I feel that none of the candidates are actually liberal (and this goes beyond just LGBT/Women/Minority causes, this extends to war &amp; civic individualism)... which was my prime reason for supporting Obama in any way I could in 08. Any advise or claims that will stir up my support for him again?

**EDIT**

Since Ron Paul apparently has such a huge pop-culture vibe. I'm NOT a supporter of Ron Paul-- nor would I ever vote for him as president, I voted for him in the primaries. I just agree with his civic values on individual liberty, and his foreign policy. NOT AT ALL his immigration/abortion/affirmative action/economic/etc. views.

"2012-04-05",1333604540,"In honor of MLK, some thoughts about Obama's 
""middle class"" and the ""evil"" of the Right","Obama is deploying a rather interesting figure: the idea of ""social Darwinism"", which is a pretty hefty concept with some rather interesitng implications. ""Fish"" decal on cars, anyone? I guess the question that is percolating for me here is: what does the idea of the ""middle class"", the centerpiece of Obama's platform, mean? How does this relate to the poor? How does it relate to criticisms of Obama vis a vis the disappoint that many have regarding his, shall we say, ""vocation"" and historical uniqueness regarding race? 

It's of course one of the more remarkably racist things that anyone even remotely touched by ""black genes"" is ""black"", plain and simple. Hitler would agree. Is anyone touched by poverty poor? In any case, the race issue is timely becuase this is the anniversary of the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr., who was, at that time, on the verge of launching a poor people's march. 

Enter Obama, years later, a ""black man"", who has had a hard time living up to the traumatic history by which his election was made possible. Today he has tried to throw down the gauntlet, in the form of the charge of ""social Darwinism"" against the Republicans, which would seem to be to the good. This emphasis on the middle class stands in some kind of contrast to Dr. King's emphasis on the poor, at a time when the Occupy movement is standing for, well, interestingly enough, not the poor as such alone, but the 99 percent. The empahsis on these two, the middle class and the 99 percent seem in a strange way to avoid a clear focus on the plight of the poor, plain and simple.

Of course this is all couched in rhetoric of ""class warfare"" by the Right. Obama's emphasis on the middle class, then, appears to be of a piece with his strateg (if that is what it is) of compromise. A compromised Dr. King, perhaps. And some noble efforts on Obama's part, notably the heath care law, the emphasis for which has been placed on a sense of a system that ""doesn't work"", rather than a system that is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. 

Which is to say that Obama's stance is compromised, maybe through and through. Add to this that he's viewed the Republican platform as a ""Trojan horse"". That is to say, a deception. 

Now, how would one characterize, in its essence, such a deception, coupled with the charge of social Darwinism? It is *evil*. This is the operating concept for Obama as regards ""peace"", as evidenced by his Nobel Peace prize speech, in which he cast Gandhi and MLK as ""idealists"", ""but there is evil in the world"". Thus, from a certian middle and space of compromise, Obama throws down this gauntlet: the Right is ""evil"". 

Evil. Dr. King's movement was founded, ostensibly, on the idea of love, in that heart on the sleeve idealism and religious, actually, engagement that was out to stand in the face of something like ""evil"" with this strange strategy that was uniquely uncompromising, the *satyagraha* or ""holding to truth"" in love in the face of brutal oppression. King's importation of Gandhi's strategy brought it quite fully into the auspices of his Christian commitment, which is Obama's commitment as well. It was not, interestingly enoiugh, Gandhi's primary commitment. Gandhiji's commitment was, first and foremost, a double commitment to truth and nonviolence, *regardless of religious doctrine*. 

Obama seeks to moblize thought and action by activating the fundamentalism to which he is committed, a war, as it were, against ""Gog and Magog"", to quote George Bush, Jr. A war against evil. From the safety of the moderate emphasis on the middle class and the middling view of health care, he is striking out against conservatism by imputing it as being, simply put, evil.

This is a time of horrific and bloody violence in the Middle East and elsewhere, and also a time of a strange, resplendent and courageous event of the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, grounded predominantly in nonviolence. 

The problem is that this nonviolence is antithetical to the concept of evil. The concept of evil in this operative sense is a mobilization for war: the mobilizatin of thought into the casting of ones opponent as being utterly devoted to causing harm. There is no question that conservatives today can indeed by quite harmful. Yet, so can liberals in something that has not yet dawned on them: that their own eschewing of the trenches of battle in favor of compromise and a certain ""middle way"" might not, itself, still fail to attain an adequate grounding and understanding. In so doing, the Left has overseen some of the more violent activities in recent years, notably the sanctions on Iraq in recent years, which, while being supposedly diplomatic, killed more than any other action undertaken in the last two decades. In these actions, deadlier than the wars in Iraq and Afghanisan combined, the deaths of 500,000 children was deemed ""worth the price"" by the Clinton administration. And in recent weeks, Obama has threatened ""diplomatic"", ""crippling sanction"" on Iran, which amounts to threatening to bring about the deaths through intentional action of potentially have a million children. 

What is going on here? Obama remains ensconced in a religious commitment whose genealogy and provenance traces right into the heart of Dr. King's religious commitment, which radically differed from Gandhi's in that it subordinates thought to religious faith. His efforts to raise the ante, to raise the stakes, to get busy or serious, are going to come out of a basis that is above all cemented in a faith commitment whose program is lodged in a conceptuality rooted in a logic of ""good versus evil"" in an all too simple and retrograde form, a form which, furthermore, has a particular program and principle of the aim of a certian dominance. In this commitment, thought can not be free and nonviolence is not adequately developed. But this was also the case for Dr. King, whose basic commitments have forged and anchored in a most unfortunate way the progress he sought, crippling it egregiously, despite some rather good intentions. 

It appears that Obama must step out from under the umbrella and safety of his religious commitment to think honestly and freely and deal with morality in a less prescribed form and rather in a more original condition of nonviolence and nonharm. Only by doing this and by decentering or deconstructing his conception of ""evil"" can he more positively and directly illuminate and vaunt the true causes that are on his true path: mortality in the issue of health care and poverty in the issue of the well being of the nation. Any attempt simply to take the conservatives as evil will fail and render Obama's efforts impotent and potentially more dangerous as well. 

And this imputation of evil will galvanize the Right and give them to affirm, in their own way, their commitment to the poor which, oddly enough, in the end, may be a bit better than Obama is going to be able to recognize. Santorum's commitment, for example, will exceed this conception of social Darwinism in the very same way that the hawks' commitment to democratization exceeded the charges of ""imperialsm"" on the part of the Left, which enabled the wars. 

And, again, at the same time, the mere avoidance of war withoiut a true commitment to free thought and nonviolence has spelled failure in a number of ways for the Left, prefiguring and enabling the brutal sanctions, but just as importantly, disabling the true support for the only real hope for the Middle East: nonviolence-based revolution.

It is that nonviolence-based revolution that Obama needs to be considering more fully at home, albeit in that form of ""revolution"" that is possible from the position of the presidency. As long as he is rooted in this conception of ""evil"", coupled with an absolute commitment of faith as program, he will systematically disable the progress that is most deeply needed for the poor and those in truly mortal peril. 

This may seem a bit general, but such generality is needed, I believe, provided that it can keep a clear head about these basic principles I have set forth here. This is the lay of the land. These issues, I believe, are what must be dealt with in order to effectuate real change.","democrats",2,"https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/ru99x/in_honor_of_mlk_some_thoughts_about_obamas_middle/"

Below are key elections to watch on Tuesday, but this is by no means a comprehensive list, so be sure to [**find your polling place**](https://www.vote.org/polling-place-locator/) and [read up on what you'll be voting on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_States_elections).

### Gubernatorial Elections

* [Kentucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Kentucky_gubernatorial_election): One-term Republican Matt Bevin is seeking re-election. In the May 21 primaries, Bevin held off three opponents to win the Republican primary. He will face Attorney General Andy Beshear, who defeated two challengers in the Democratic primary. The latest poll from Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Strategy has the two candidates in a dead heat.
* [Mississippi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Mississippi_gubernatorial_election): Faced with an open seat due to current Gov. Phil Bryants term limits, Democrats could potentially stage an upset in this historically Republican state. While Mississippi hasnt elected a Democrat to the role since 1999, the two state officials competing for the seat  Attorney General Jim Hood (D) and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves (R)  are within striking distance of one another. 

### Legislative Elections

* [Virginia General Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly): Republicans control the House of Delegates with 51 seats to Democrats' 48, and the state Senate with 20 seats to Democrats' 19, with one vacancy in each chamber. All 140 seats are on the ballot Tuesday. Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2009, but they have held on to both the Senate since 2014 and House since 1999 by slim margins. Democrats are within striking distance of taking either chamber. If they were to win both, this would position the party to control the next round of redistricting ahead of the 2020 census.
* Legislative elections will be held for both houses of the [Louisiana Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Legislature), the [Mississippi Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Legislature), and the lower house of the [New Jersey Legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Legislature).  

### Mayoral Elections

* [San Francisco, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_San_Francisco_mayoral_election): London Breed, the first African American woman the city has elected for mayor, is now running for a full term.
* [South Bend, IN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_Bend,_Indiana_mayoral_election): Democratic presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg wont be running for reelection but hes endorsed his former chief of staff James Mueller. Mueller is the favorite in a race against public school teacher and Republican candidate Sean Haas.
* [Philadelphia, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Philadelphia_mayoral_election): Kenney is running on raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour, maintain supervised injection sites and the city's soda tax, and ensure the city's compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. Ciancaglini promises to end Philadelphia's status as a sanctuary city and to cancel plans to establish sites where people can legally inject heroin.

### Ballot Measures

* [Washington State](https://ballotpedia.org/Washington_elections,_2019): The use of affirmative action in Washington state as it relates to government jobs and state universities has been barred since 1998, when voters approved a measure banning it. This year, voters will have the option to reinstate affirmative action.
* [New York City, NY](https://ballotpedia.org/City_elections_in_New_York,_New_York_(2019)): A ballot initiative asks voters whether theyd like to use ranked-choice voting in races such as the mayors election and the city council race. If the initiative passes, it would bring ranked-choice voting to the most populous city in the country, a huge step for pro-ranked-choice reform efforts.

I was wrong. Many in the comments are saying no black person alive today was a slave, how we already have affirmative action and how white people today have never been slave owners. I dont see how that matters at all. There are still repercussions of slavery to this day and segregation was not that long ago. Black people were enslaved for over 400 years with an additional 100 of segregation. Japanese internment camps and the holocaust were not nearly as long. Both groups received reparations. Germany to this day pays Israel. Why do they gaslight us and make us feel crazy for even considering reparations.

Basically, Ive been trying to put myself out there and find a romantic partner. I took some time after my last relationship to gather myself and build my self esteem. I realized I made myself really vulnerable to generally selfish men who often took advantage of me, so Ive been hyper aware of not repeating this.

That being said, I had been talking to this guy I met through a dating app, and we agreed to FaceTime tonight at a specific time that was a little late for me, but not anything crazy. I figured it would be short anyways, because the purpose of this call was so we could kind of meet before meeting in person. I texted about half an hour before to see if we were still on, and got dolled up. 

He replied 10 minutes after we were meant to start FaceTiming (so 40 minutes after I sent the message), and apologized for the delay saying hes ready now. I understand, it happens like that sometimes. I tell him he can call but then he says that hes at a store but we can still talk.

This is when I got annoyed and I said, I thought we were going to facetime? And he said We are, but Im just grabbing a few things. I wont be in the store forever lol.  At this point its about a half hour after we were meant to have started talking.

I felt annoyed that this would be our first time seeing each other, and he intended on splitting his attention between me and his shopping. I felt annoyed he was late. I felt like the basic courtesy would be, at minimum, to let me know things ran over time for him and just reschedule. I felt he was basically proposing I wait for him to finish his shopping if I wanted a proper call.  So this is where Im not sure if I did the right thing or not.

I basically told him I was over the situation and I wasnt really feeling like pursuing this anymore, then deleted his number. I dont know if I was too impatient, or to quick to become unnerved. Should I have tried to be more understanding?

Its been tough, dating as a black woman. Im scared that Im letting my frustrations with how Ive been treated fuel my actions, and that Im pushing people away for petty things. Was I right to cut it off when I did?

"2014-12-09",1418090980,"I reached a moment of relief today. I don't have to acknowledge, or give any merit to white people's opinions.","Reddit has always been racist. But with everything going on with Mike Brown and Eric Garner, it's become untolerable. This is my lurk account, but several times a week I've been trying to give statistics and use logic to show these white people/coons that they speak nothing but idiocity and are reaffirming their own racial biases against SuperNegro black people that are somehow killed 21x more often by the police than white.

Then I reached a moment of clarity...I don't have to listen to this garbage anymore. Their opinions really don't matter to me. I've even told a few people that their opinions don't matter because they are not making ANY sort of concentrated effort toward fixing the problem, or raising awareness. Too many white people are comfortable whining about ""black culture"" and black people, when they can name 2 black people they are even aware of, tops (Obama and Al Sharpton). It *really* doesn't matter to them how many black people die, they just need to have their opinion heard because they aren't used to *not* being heard.

But I don't have to listen anymore. I am trying my best to block out the ignorance. This has worked wonders for other things white people feel a need to pipe in on: cultural appropriation, affirmative action (they love pulling that topic up even though it hasn't really affected any of them), black on black crime (they bring this up even though they don't know any black people or care about the fact they die), and lack of representation of PoC in media (they hate when this comes up but don't even realize they are upset because it questions the status quo). 

I don't care what white people think anymore. If they are on some ignorant trip, I'm not listening anymore. I also do my best to extricate anyone from my life that spouts BS.

"2015-07-27",1438024288,"If you like cartoons, and haven't watched Steven Universe yet, this post is for you","I really like this show.

Question, why should you watch it? That's a [valid question.](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/0/0c/Reformed_Animation_Amethyst_People_Crying.gif) If you're like me, you might count the people of color who show up in the background of a show or movie. But in this show, those background characters? Not only do they exist but sometimes have speaking roles. One of them is even a main character. Sorta. It depends. I plan on making a post later about what it means to be black while non-human. But anyway...

You should watch this show because: It's bloody brilliant it is. It starts off being rather silly and evolves into something bigger than that. It's a kid's show for sure, but it's on the same level as the likes of Adventure Time, only slightly less angsty. And WAY more focused. And consistent. And honestly, it's not like Adventure Time except for the fact it's creator worked on Adventure Time for a spell, and it takes place in that akward genre where adults and kids can like a show *for the same reasons*. What I mean is, you got movies like from Dreamworks where kids and adults are laughing, but never at the same jokes. Whereas you got movies like from Pixar where kids and adults are laughing at the same thing. Steven Universe falls (primarily) in the latter category.

The characters are genuine great. The music is on point. And, to be honest, I've probably never cried so much for any cartoon before. (Though I might be in an emotional state of mind, as I cried during the song about wanting to see a giant woman.) The show is about [Steven Universe](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140830014546/steven-universe/images/7/76/Tumblr_n9c0ysjQid1t5u6j6o1_500.gif), hence the name. He's half human and half gem. Gems being some sort of alien race that apparently can mate with humans. His mother gave up her physical form in order to give birth to him, but he inherited her gem powers from her. His father is a guy who looks like a beach bum version of Homer Simpson. I wouldn't call him a deadbeat dad on account of the fact that he's a part of Steven's life, he just doesn't have his act together. Steven is adorable with his little afro and singing voice.

He's raised by three gems whose relation I'm not sure of. But they act as mother figures to him. The leader of them, and obviously the best one, is [Garnet](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/8/87/Garnet_gauntlets.gif) With thick hips, a cubed afro, and always wearing shades, she's strong and short of words. Which is just so perfect. For while she rarely speaks, everything she says is just right. If something is her idea, she'll let you know it's her idea. If she destroys your shop, she'll let you know she won't come back to help. And everything is soft spoken and loving. Incredibly loving. Fun fact, Garnet's voice actress happens to be a one [Estelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelle_(musician\)) who happens to be her favorite musician as well. Her parenting style is the quiet affirming sort. She never has nothing but the [right things](http://38.media.tumblr.com/0e6b25240447b70bf3106ec824fa87a0/tumblr_neozsgEeOD1rqznndo1_400.gif) to say to Steven. Though her interactions with other humans could use some work. Even though she's not a human, she's still a person. She doesn't always have all the answers.

Then there's [Pearl](https://secure.static.tumblr.com/9daa50bfac8d8bdac7f9e4e2a9dca767/nvxf3n4/AEYnm1v96/tumblr_static_69imdka9xgwskokwg48k8ogog_640_v2.gif). The one with straight hair, long nose, no hips, you know the sort. I didn't like her at first. At best, she's a samurai ballerina. At worst? She got [problems](http://media.giphy.com/media/10pstxL1VDGbte/giphy.gif). But the truth is they all do. It's another great thing about this series, is that as it progresses the characters become more deep. Even with Pearl, I noticed her magic weapon was a spear, but she seems awfully well versed in swords. I thought that might've been an oversight, turns out there's a story behind it. What is that story? You'll have to find out for yourself. Her parenting style is neurotic to say the least. But that's good, I can't ever argue with safety first.

Finally, there is [Amethyst](https://33.media.tumblr.com/9a866e346a36131bc271adc1c05f5db0/tumblr_inline_nrgdspSu5B1tuq92p_500.gif). Another character I did not like at first. She's gross. By the gods is she gross. And she can be kind of a dickcunt, but to be fair they all can, even Steven. But she does have some redeeming qualities. For example, she can [dance.](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/steven-giantwoman-a.gif) Also, her backstory is probably the most [heartbreaking](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/stevenuniverse-fanon/images/f/fe/Pearl_and_Amethyst_hug.gif) for me personally. Still, she's gross. Her attitude is gross, and the things she does with her body is gross. Her parenting style is more akin to the 'cool sister' mom and all the terrible reprecussions it entails. Thankfully, Steven has Garnet and Pearl to keep him on the straight and narrow. But she's still [gross](http://i.imgur.com/LdZaeqy.gif).

There's more characters, obviously. I mentioned Steven's dad [Greg Universe](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-05/14/18/imagebuzz/webdr01/anigif_optimized-5800-1431641292-19.gif). He's not a bad guy and there are moments when I can see what a sentient magic rock from outer space saw in him. Steven's best friend is [Connie Maheswaran](http://media.giphy.com/media/WhYw5yZLB2Y5W/giphy.gif). Who I think is Japanese based on just exactly one word she said at one specific time, but who cares. And also the two kids who run the donut shop, [Lars and Sadie.](http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-04/1/18/enhanced/webdr13/anigif_enhanced-buzz-20795-1427927573-5.gif) They've got their own issues they need to work out, and doing so demonstrates one of the greatest strengths of the show... pacing. Everything that happens does so at all the right times, even the developing relationships of minor characters. There are still even more minor characters, like the different families. Onion's family, the Frybro family, the Pizza family. My favorite Pizza being [Kofi](http://24.media.tumblr.com/60f32d4aac49ab49a09d9df500c09d64/tumblr_n50m0oT2Yk1twfbfro4_250.gif). Yes, her entire family works at a pizza shop. Also, there is a [lion](http://38.media.tumblr.com/d1905a3150613d80a9cc20ff7bf4e908/tumblr_n0ea8cMkq21rkiy6bo1_500.gif). He, or she, just sorta lays about most of the time not bothering anyone.

The show does have bad guys. But it can't really be discussed without spoiling it since they show up so late. In the first arc of the show, it has a real ""monster of the week"" feel to it like Sailor Moon or Power Rangers. Except there doesn't seem to be any BBEG driving them. Sometimes they fight [mascots](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/8/81/Frybo_Dancing.gif), sometimes it's [cat fingers](http://www.cartoonbrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/catfingers-b.gif), sometimes they even fight [themselves](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--p98J-1VW--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/rwwf9k3mpliahnoelfbj.gif). But as the show progresses, you notice just how complex it can be, that things might not always be [so simple.](http://media.tumblr.com/d308a114098e584fe76e165ac64a3092/tumblr_inline_nh7promSla1rrosjs.gif) Even now, two seasons in, and there are plenty of questions left unanswered.

But the most important thing that intertwines all of this that makes this show special is the feelings, the emotions. Mostly jokes. Dumb ones. I admit, ""Meat Beat Mania"" went over my head. But it runs a whole gamut. Sometimes teaching kids [valuable lessons.](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/993/917/4f2.gif) Sometimes it's [confusing](http://i.minus.com/idTdl4YZ3jfDW.gif). It's got plenty of [action](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/3/3c/Tumblr_nhvzntFA0O1r3mf8lo1_400.gif). And my favorite part is sometimes it's sad.

In my book, the show only did one thing wrong. One [terrible thing](http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tg/image/1427/41/1427419836424.gif) wrong.

In conclusion... you should watch the show Steven Universe because Garnet is simply [the best.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/925/061/611.gif) She's the very definition of cool. Her deadpannery is unmatched. She even gets the best and longest song in the series. Also, that Steven kid is [pretty cool](https://31.media.tumblr.com/9dbd261341a163c1b2668b1dc418d4ff/tumblr_inline_nkhwhnpD2n1qdo426.gif). All the other characters are great when you get to know them. Though sometimes I [wonder...](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/1/1a/Amethyst_and_Pearl_fusion_04.gif) And really, you should just watch this show because let's be honest, what else have you [got to do?](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/steven-universe/images/5/5c/Tumblr_n3xur9zo2U1qjna6io1_500.gif)

"2016-11-11",1478886349,"my friend created an evolving list of what to do/what she's focusing on in the wake of the election and i thought i'd share it here. feel free to add to it.","my evolving list of what to do/what i'm focusing on, incomplete and imperfect, feel free to add. some of these are things I feel comfortable giving advice on and some I'm trying to learn too. let's talk please and continue to hold each other close.

1. Read up on fascist/authoritarian regimes and resistance (one link I've found helpful, more recs welcome:http://www.nybooks.com/&/trump-election-autocracy-rules-fo&/ )

2. Read up on which policies can go through fastest, how they go through, how they can be blocked (some useful links: http://obamacarefacts.com/&/what-does-president-trump-mean&/ , http://www.npr.org/&/fact-check-donald-trumps-first-100-day& ; http://www.latimes.com/&/la-na-pol-trump-executive-power-20&

3. Self defense classes - take one, organize one. ones happening this weekend in ny are filling up fast. If you're a member of a group who will be targeted by his supporter's and want to arm yourself I'm not gonna stop you, just be sure to get the skills to ensure your weapon isn't used against you. Self defense works if you work it - talk to your friends about your different techniques and quiz yourself on what you'd do in different situations.

4. Suicide prevention - learn how to respond if you see or hear warning signs. learn how to do a suicidal ideation assessment. learn how to intervene without calling 911 and how to assemble a team of support. Make a safety plan for yourself or people you love if you need to (one resource from Icarus Project here - http://theicarusproject.net/&/IcarusNavigatingCrisisHandout&) (I can definitely speak to a lot of this, please reach out if you have questions)

5. Repro health care/general medical care - I want to build up my skills in these arenas - both to be a better bystander and to be able to provide services if shit starts really getting cut. Lola Pelligrino is amazing and is offering some stuff in BK - https://docs.google.com/&/1FAIpQLSdyoMZw8ZuG2K3CQh&/viewform I also plan to to go to this on Saturday - https://www.facebook.com/events/1826783650900082/ I know that I know lots of radical and brilliant doulas who probably have even more good resources on this (teach me how to perform an abortion tbh pls)

6. Figure out what you need to get in order before January (take all docs here with a grain of salt, I've heard some stuff is incomplete or not totally accurate, but you know your body/situation better than anyone else and this is a good starting point - https://docs.google.com/&/1QjiJi4YBbmdnWyTdKDb&/mobilebasic&; https://docs.google.com/&/17Rj40_i39gTuo4hMNNmhToL0&/preview; specifically help w ID changes: http://tldef.org/work_show.php?id=7; another thread for trans people https://twitter.com/chasestrangio/status/796684713880616961; specific info on immigration: http://www.immigrantjustice.org/&/what-do-next-protect-immi&)

7. Donate to orgs that we will need in the days ahead - larger orgs like ACLU Nationwide and Planned Parenthood Action, and smaller orgs like Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP) Many lists available - in NY I would look at North Star Fund's grantees. And look to support work outside of nonprofits as well - more on that soon, recs for places you're donating are welcome. http://www.whatcanido.io/ has a list at the bottom of orgs as well!

8. Offer materials support to people who need it - Tell your trans and POC friends you'll walk them home or call them a cab if you have money to do so (hopefully if you are my friend you know I would do this but just in case - I will always always do this never hesitate to reach out). Give someone who doesn't have access to resources you do or who is too sick or sad to leave the house your seamless password. Donate to individual's immigration funds, gender affirmation surgeries, rent funds, medical care, etc. Supporting survival of people who've always been most marginalized by the state is crucial.

9. Become an active bystander: I have lots of thoughts on this one and would love to work on a workshop with someone if anyone has more skills. There have already been an increase in hate crimes. It's happening all over, including in ""liberal"" pockets like New York. You need to think through how you will respond if you see someone being harassed. My very brief advice - focus on the target of violence/harassment (ask are you ok, do you want ot come with me, put your body physically between harasser and harassed); get other people involved (say specifically - hey you with the green shirt I need your help, hey I'm going to talk to that woman will you talk to the man yelling at her, etc); think through how you will respond if you freeze and what will help you push past freezing.(one guide: http://www.themarysue.com/bystanders-harassment-guide/)

10. To my fellow white people - Talk to me please. I want to figure out what we're doing and I want it to be more than ""having conversations"" but I also want to really get into how we're having those conversations - many people have reached out to me for advice on how to do this stuff and I'm certainly no expert but am always happy to chat and be support for those convos. Also should we be trying to do some sort of Talk to a trump supporter action  as someone w no (known) trump supporters in my immediate network I want to figure out how to support people who do and get more white people connected w those white people who did support trump? But also, how are we moving beyond the ally complex to more concrete *action*? Let's talk. On that note, connect to an affinity group if that makes sense to you - Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) for white people, Solidaire for wealthy people, Resource Generation for young wealthy people.

11. To my fellow Jews - I am terrified. I am really really like ancestors screaming in my head to watch out terrified. I have a hard time finding Jewish community but I really want to be connected so please please please reach out. Let's share our histories and share our plans. 76% of us voted against Trump. Let's figure out what's going on with that remaining 24%. Let's step up for folks who are being more directly targeted in areas where we are not, and stay aware of and vigilant about anti-semitism. (and, for Jews and non Jews if you're confused about what anti semitism looks like and how this has been a virulently anti-semitic campaign here's one link let me know if you need more https://www.buzzfeed.com/&/anti-semitism-has-emerged-from-t&)

12. To my fellow sexual assault survivors - this election was one giant trigger, and I think I for some reason felt embarrassed to admit that. I didn't want to admit that he was getting to me on that level. But he did and he will and let's not hide or pretend we're not affected let's stick with each other.

13. Get more of a grip on local politics and what can be changed on a local level, soon. Don't be scared of seeming like a ""bad radical"" for acknowledging that there are REAL IMPACTS on people's lives of laws and who is in power and we need to include that as part of our strategy.

14. Encrypt your shit. Nothing is secure but you can make it more secure. Start by downloading Signal. further guide here: https://medium.com/&/things-to-know-about-web-security-befo&

15. Don't forget to hold on to art and poetry and music and writing. Keep creating and sharing things that are beautiful and joyful and powerful. I'm feeling inspired by Octavia's Brood 

16. Get offline and get together. I'm really freaked out by how isolated myself and others felt due to so much of the election discourse happening online. I don't want that to continue. Talk to each other, get together. Get to know your neighbors if you don't already. I want to see you all. I love you.","blackladies",7,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/5cfsan/my_friend_created_an_evolving_list_of_what_to/"
"2022-02-03",1643917108,"Forget about Affirmative Action, eliminating SAT scores is what will bring equality and boost black student enrollment in higher education","The conservative Supreme court is likely to outlaw Affirmative action soon,  but behind the scenes, activists have been pushing for other methods to boost minority enrollment in colleges. SAT and ACT have been thought to favor rich students and give them a leg up in the college admission process. Test preps, academic support, ability to redo the SAT many times are some privileges enjoyed by wealthier students. 
 California State University has now permanently stopped using standardized SAT scores for admissions across all its campuses. More than two thirds of colleges in the US including Harvard have paused the  use of SAT. This has increased the number of black student admitted already. 

Colleges that have already axed the SATs are seeing more diversity. For example, 
Temple University student of color community grew to 45%up from 42% just a year ago and 39% the year before that. Both Black and Latinx students were admitted in record numbers.
https://news.temple.edu/news/2022-02-02/message-washington-post-op-ed-resonates-college-admissions-audiences

My feeling is that even if they outlaw Affirmative Acton, and I think they will, we will be alright. The deck is stuck against us but black folk are never asleep at the switch. We already saw the inevitable end of Affirmative Action and started fighting for other ways to help ourselves. California State University had to be sued for discrimination which led to them axing the unfair standardized tests. I think once Affirmative Action is overturned by this conservative Supreme court, colleges will permanently stop using SAT, ACT for admissions.","blackladies",14,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/sjs5qi/forget_about_affirmative_action_eliminating_sat/"

""Got into a ivy league university? You just got there because of scholarships and a racial quota""-proceeds to ignore the fact that affirmative action includes white women and the disabled too while invalidating old fashioned hard work. 

""Rap music is totally awful and is only filled with lyrics about bitches, drugs, hoes and money.""-proceeds to gush about Eminem and Macklemore. You know, the only good rappers. 

""You people were living in mud huts prior to us coming and bringing you here. You should be grateful!""-proceeds to ignore the rape and division of Africa after centuries of colonization and the fact that a lot of ancient african history has been erased/stolen/or burned to the ground. Also ignoring the ruins of great ancient kingdoms like Timbuktu, Ghana, and Mali.

""Twerking is disgusting and degrading to women. I mean-who would even want to do that?""--proceeds to add the number 1 twerker on vine....who is a non-black woman.

""An attractive black person?""--proceeds to explain that the only reason said person is attractive is due to white features or having to have some 'otherness' to them (I've even heard people say this about Lupita N'yongo-who is as black as they come.) Other races though, they are just hot on their own. 
*Also if you have natural hair, they will still ask if its all real. Then when you answer truthfully that it is real-still give you a look of quiet incredulity.

 ""You seriously shouldn't be offended by this. In fact, stop talking about race! You are perpetuating stereotypes-you're probably the racist here! Free speech is dead!""--proceeds to admonish those people who use free speech to peacefully protest.

"2013-05-24",1369412320,"Not sure whether to applaud or start crying: ""what bothers me is not the simple racism. its the lack of empathy."" - xjeremyjohnsonx","what bothers me is not the simple racism. its the lack of empathy.

not all of us are bad is all I see, hear, and read. but the second a black person is attacked or killed or targeted- most white people are looking for ways to blame the victim. 

desperate to find something. When the victim is black or brown and the perpetrator looks white the benefit of the doubt just extends to them. 

and if not that, theres just&nothing. no outage, no gasp, not even a flinch. Just a shrug of the shoulders and a dismissive thats just how things are as they go back to doing whatever. 

that tells me so much. so fucking much. 

every time someone derails a post about black people.

every time someone says they dont feel sorry for us [like we were asking them to? but dont get me started. please.]

every time theres outrage and disbelief whenever we manifest in the media as beloved characters in movies, books, and video games. 

every time they dig to try and find something wrong to knock us down [see charles ramseys criminal past being brought up. see the trayvon martin smear campaign, as if smoking weed is now punishable by death.]

every time they want to say the n-word and become so lucid at the prospect of not being entitled to treat us any kind of fucking way 

just the lack of basic respect. just the lack of basic empathy. 

black people dont hate white people because of slavery. they dont blame you for your ancestors/

they hate you because you show, in countless little ways time and time again, that you sincerely dont value us as human beings.

You only care about racism when you think its against you.

You only acknowledge the shit weve gone through when it suits your joke, your argument, or your analogy. And worse yet, you say you dont see colors only people but then turn around and cite stereotypes like gospel truth. 

Every time we try to do something, try to have something, there is incident.

We cant be president: youll hang caricatures of us from trees [it happened]. We cant be actors and actresses: were apparently so far removed from the human experience that were unrelatable [see: Rue from the hunger games &amp; the backlash. see: potential black johnny storm backlash. ]. We cant do music: youve devalued and appropriated everything but rap, even that you dismiss as not real music. We cant go to college: according to you the only way were good enough to get in is through Affirmative Action which you want to take away. We cant wear our natural hair: its unprofessional and you wont hire us. We cant get jobs period if our names are too black or we sound black on the phone. 

we cant do shit. because you wont let us. 

and you dont care.

thats the kicker. you sincerely do not care. until we get angry and call you racist. then suddenly why do you hate us??? why are you being this way???? 

i know perfectly well not all white people are racist. I dont have any black friends in real life, not on purpose mind you but black kids didnt like me for acting white [you can see the irony] so Ive always hung out with white people. All my friends offline are white. Most of my exes are white too. 

what is the nail in the racist-coffin is that not if you yourself have ever done/thought any of the things i outlined here its the fact that you really dont care that this happens to us. 

you are not bothered in the slightest. 

and when we talk about it you wave your hand or roll your eyes or sigh or shrug. 

as if its burdensome to you. if it annoys you, imagine how I feel. 

but you dont do that. you refuse to even try. 

and that is why so many black people are just done. 

I dont think I can ever hate white people in that broader sense, because I force myself to think of my friends when I do. but lately Ive been getting more and more frustrated. 

Ive been on a blackness kick because I wantred to see just how people would react if i went there. If I broke one of the most sacred-rule of racism and actually dared to talk about it in-depth. 

and all over tumblr Ive seen basically the same thing. that you dont care. but you want us to care. 

you want the empathy from us that you yourself cant even be bothered to give. 

and you think thats not entitlement. 

for the white people who this applies to I dont have anything else to say. For the white people who it doesnt, I hope this has at least been interesting for you. 

but I, myself, am tired. Tired and now depressed. 

goodnight.

"2020-09-04",1599193218,"The Doula Chronicles: Why it can be difficult to support black businesses","I had a baby in July. I always knew that if i ever had kids, I'd want a natural birth with a midwife and doula. Black, of course. Well, I couldnt have my black mifwife. She was $7,000 in cash, and a birthing center was covered by my insurance, and all of the midwives were white. ""OK, no problem,"" I thought. ""I can still have a black doula."" I started my search when I was only 8 weeks pregnant. I knew that connecting with someone would be important, and I wanted to give myself time to find the right one. I found a great one who lived about an hour and a half away. Again, no problem. Labor can literally be days long, and she'd have time to get here when it was time. Because I found her so early, we went a long time w/o speaking. Once I got further along, Corona had hit, but we made a date to facetime, and discuss a plan. She missed it. I called, no answer. She calls back the next day with apologies and says she had an appointment that ran late. Long story short, this happened 2 more times, and I had to drop her. Let me interrupt here by saying a good doula can cost anywhere from $350 (novice) to $3,500 (best of the best/traveler ). I was willing to pay lower mid range, which is a large sum, if you ask me. You do NOT want to give your money to someone who can't manage time, and will prioritize clients over you. She couldn't be on time to a damn facetime call, but im supposed to trust her to make an hour and a half drive to be here for my birth? Nah. So, on to the next. I found another black doula. LOVED her. Military nurse, no other clients, done this for a while,had a real ""black girl convo"" when we first spoke. Simply loved her. She TEXTS me weeks after i hire her to tell me that she got her school schedule, and she couldn't commit to my birth. Ok, can't be mad at that, i guess. But, now, im due soon, and out of a doula. Which brings us to number 3. I tell her everything. The failed doulas, the desire to have a black woman in my corner through this, tell her about everything im going through. Loved her. ""This is it!"" I thought. So, we start the process again. Contracts. Deposits, etc. Red flags start popping up early. This is already long, so I won't go into details. However, there were things she'd say she was going to do, and they'd never get done. She'd text me, id respond, and then I'd never get an affirmative response toward the action. Once I noticed, I would only pay her when I got a response. (Was paying in installments) This was in late May and early June. I was due 7/15. The last id heard from her was 6/12. I reached out repeatedly, and ultimately had my baby, having paid a portion of the fee, sans doula. Now,  she has finally made contact (2 months after my daughter's birth) and has given me SEVERAL bullshit stories about ""trying to reach me,"" and telling me that she was responding to me all along, but I wasn't getting the texts (Yes, really). So now, she's told me that she will pay me tomorrow. I'm already getting BS about her check coming in the mail, and what time it comes, and how I probably won't get paid until the evening. I am beginning to think i'll never get it back. Long story to say; I wanted a black woman beside me for the birth of my daughter. I put my trust in THREE different ones. 3 different ENTREPRENEURS. I want to support us. I buy black owned whenever possible. I dont understand how I can go to THREE different businesses, and have the same negative outcome across the board. Not because of COVID, but because 3 different people couldn't seem to get their shit together. Now, I'm not saying this is a reason to not support black businesses/black women. What I am saying is, sometimes we try our damnest, and still get shit on our faces. Things like this happen, and we immediately say ""That's it, im done, I give up.""  However,  no matter how many times a clothing designer says they don't make their clothes for black folks, we don't give up on them. We'll keep buying their shit! We have to give each other a chance. One black woman does not represent all of us. I want to continue to support as many black entrepreneurs, business owners, creators etc., as I can. But, for a moment, I could see how one could throw their hands up and be done. Because all I wanted and needed in that moment, was a black woman beside me.

So yesterday A posts a picture of a black woman with the face of a man in teams&. I feel very weird about it but just ignore it as pure stupidity and dont take offense to it. D tells A she doesnt like the picture. A kind of rolls her eyes and eyes her other work friends. 

Later on in the day when only me, D and L are there D starts talking about this white man suing a company for firing him and hiring a black woman because of affirmative action. Im telling D that most people who hated it have no idea how it works and who it really benefited and all that. L says Well i work hard and I have never had a problem.

I later tell D to be careful what she talks about around those women because they are white and will take up for each other and dont let them turn you into the problem. 


Then today, D tells A to be careful posting stuff like that because people can see it on Teams.

Rarely will you see celebrities take any action that might displease their corporate masters. Most celebs aren't as [blatant about it as Laila Ali](https://atlantadailyworld.com/2016/09/30/laila-ali-refuses-to-support-black-lives-matter/), but seeing famous entertainers as agents of change is about as realistic as the idea that [systemic police reform was ever a serious possibility](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/us/politics/minneapolis-defund-police.html) in 2020 America.

Celebrities always remain a safe distance behind any movement toward social justice, because they literally cannot afford to risk multimillion-dollar brand empires by alienating the mainstream (white) audience.

All you'll ever find from celebrity ""culture"" is the most profitable version of white society that they want to believe (and literally buy into) about themselves.

**Example**: is the average white person racist? No -- they support BLM alongside their favourite stars on social media for a few days after yet another person is murdered by police. They hover like unwelcome ghosts over subreddits for non-white people and can't resist offering their approving opinions or silent downvotes.

Cultural minorities (Native, black, brown, Asian, LGBT, etc.) will never control mainstream narratives beyond what the cultural majority already wants to see.

**Example**: white women are not members of a cultural minority in modern society. Why, then, are cisgender/heterosexual white women (usually middle-class or above) prioritised as unofficial spokespeople for cultural ""liberation""?

In reality, [fewer than half (45%) of white adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/09/16/support-for-black-lives-matter-has-decreased-since-june-but-remains-strong-among-black-americans/) now express at least some support of the Black Lives Matter movement, [down from 60% in June](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/). They are falling back asleep.

In the meantime, we are told to embrace: ""black whore who loves violent sex"" roleplay rebranded as ""black feminist empowerment""; black male abuse and violence as ""masculinity"" to be excused; happily inoffensive modern Aunt Jemima caricatures as a vision for progress; calculatingly presented ""strong black women"" and borderline ""magical Negro"" stereotypes through Disneyfied appropriation of African imagery, released right on time to capitalise on the middle-class white mood.

**Example**: imagine Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande in the place of Megan and Cardi in the video for ""WAP"". No? You can't? Yes, that's right. It would never happen. Why is that? We already know why (hint: the good white women aren't whores). But Gaga can appropriate LGBT culture as she sees fit since drag queens are cool, and a sprinkling of cringe-inducing ""sassy black woman"" mannerisms are always on-trend for white gay culture. Grande can use blatant brownface whenever she wants, because it's fashionable to be ambiguously brown nowadays (for reference, Ariana Grande is a bright-white person [beneath all that spray-tan](https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28337288/fans-accuse-vogue-ariana-grande-darken-skin-color-black-august-cover-instagram/) and cover-up).

Questions:

- What if Megan thee Stallion and Cardi B. role-playing whores in a music video is really just two black women role-playing whores in a music video? What if the ""controversy"" is really just new marketing spin defending ugly old imagery (the _""**Jezebel**""_ type)? What if ""you can't do it to me because I'm doing it to myself"" is really just the same abuse given an internalised excuse?

- What if Lizzo suddenly proclaiming that body-positivity is too ""commercialised"" is just a self-preserving reaction to stem backlash against her for using the ""smiling, inoffensive, overweight black woman"" trope (the _""**Mammy**""_ type) as her primary means to become rich and famous? (Just wait for the ""authentic"" Lizzo makeup kit and clothing line.)

- What if celebrities aren't really our rich-and-famous friends, but rather, corporate brands designed for and largely catering to mainstream white audiences, constructed entirely to profit from the entertaining ""drama"" of our pain and emotional manipulation? What if most black and brown celebrities are just demographically-shifted versions of the toxic white ones?

- What if all the talk about ""self-care as revolution"" actually makes it practically impossible to actually stand up, move and take action to create change -- because the meaning of ""revolution"" has suddenly been reframed as the revolutionary act of repeating self-affirmations in the mirror and taking rebellious selfies?

- What if posting woke memes on Instagram and arguing on social media is actually just complicit participation in mass distraction, while the white male operators of these platforms earn billions from weaponised misinformation and turn a blind eye to violent hate speech?

---

Have you ever wondered why you perpetually feel tired, depressed and angry, rather than uplifted, energised and motivated?

What if everything we're told by the mass media about self-care, celebrity role models and social change is wrong?

Why are we defending corporate brands and lying to ourselves?

What happens after we wake up?

What comes next?

They began to conflate immigrants with ""diversity"" somehow.  Then they talked about how the NFL isn't even a good example of diversity because 68% of the players are Black.  Then there was an inane comment about ""Isn't that the dream of Affirmative action?  Overrepresentation of Blacks?""

The problem is, her remark was consistent despite the fact that the NFL is mostly Black because . . . MOST OF THOSE BLACK MEN ARE AMERICANS.

True, we wouldn't have MMA without immigrants, either, but mixing up immigration issues with diversity issues uncovered a huge blind spot in that conversation that I think is probably not unique to that conversation.

Ive found myself having lots of conversations with them over the past few years where I am reminded that even though were all Black, we dont all view issues of social justice, BLM, the defunding the police movement, climate change, etc in the same way. 

On the police killings of Black people, for example, theyve expressed views along the lines of Well they shouldnt have been talking back to no cop. And I counter with But does that justify them dying over it? 

Or on defunding police, they have a reaction that, frankly, isnt any different from your average Karen in that the notion sounds crazy and why would you want less police protection in your community.

I wrote a post on it, then saw the book _Caste_ by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson. Have you read it, and what did you think?","From a [Washington Post review](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/running-deeper-than-race-americas-caste-system/2020/07/30/501af19a-c7a5-11ea-a99f-3bbdffb1af38_story.html) of the book:

&gt; Wilkerson spent much of the 2010s researching and writing her book, just as the United States was moving in a direction that seemed to validate its thesis. A series of killings of African Americans, often by police officers, helped birth a new anti-racist social movement. Athletes knelt, monuments to slavery began to come down, reparations for enslavement and its long aftermath became a mainstream idea, and the politics of White grievance took over the White House. When she finished her book, she titled it Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents. Wilkersons thesis is that Americans current obsession with race is somewhat misplaced, for there is a deeper and more intractable system that hides behind the chimera of race, and that system is properly called American caste.

I saw the recently-published book's title before writing the post, but knew nothing about it otherwise.

The post itself is here: [Brahmin, Dalit, Brown, Black: internalising and (projecting/protecting) a Desi-to-worldwide caste system?](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/i5kcwp/brahmin_dalit_brown_black_internalising_and/)

I wrote that post in response to an ugly strain of otherwise hard-to-understand racism, specifically directed at ""the blacks"", among Desi (Indian and other South Asian) people on Reddit.

That repetition of anti-black, anti-Native, anti-Latino stereotypes collectively represent a failure to recognise and resist the model-minority stereotype. Specifically, much of the current vitriol surrounds affirmative action as Asian families have been steered into conflict against African-American and Latino applicants (instead of directing that anger against [white women, who are the major beneficiaries of affirmative action](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action)) for spots at prestigious high schools and Ivy-league universities.

I compiled a post that brings facts beyond the racist rhetoric and [posted it today](https://np.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/i9yg4f/when_karen_is_your_real_enemy_affirmative_action/), though it seems to have (predictably) fallen on deaf ears thus far, similar to the post about modern-day caste comparisons in the Westernised Desi community.

That being said, I was recently in a subreddit (not sure if Im allowed to indicate the name ) which was sharing a video about some chic named Amala something. This was clearly a black woman on what seemed like podcast/radio type show. She went on a mini rant regarding Affirmative Action, calling it racist.  She indicated how it was stealing opportunities from people and took away the notion of basing things on merit. The whole thing rubbed me a certain type of way, gave me Candace Owens vibes. What unfortunately shocked me (should we really be shocked anymore?) were the comments. Hundreds of comments in support of this lady, calling affirmative action racist and saying KBJ only got the position due to her race. I felt like I was in the upside down yall. Like people cannot logically think like this right? Sure there may be problems with the policy in certain conditions but as whole it has helped so much. 

Many called out saying they didnt understand the representation matters message that has been spread. Many called this anti diversity saying diversity is about individuals. Majority said job positions should be based on merit. But&.if this was the case then affirmative action would not have been needed. Obviously, merit was thrown out the window for most of Americas history, given the same demographic the only chance. These redditors were something else and made me sick. Dear god, the ignorance and bigotry. Similar policies are here in Canada for marginalized groups (mainly for the First Nations population) but Ive never thought to myself that wow so racist. I need that help too, such lack of self awareness and lack of knowledge pertaining to ones countrys history. 

Anywho, from your Canadian neighbour, I feel for you ladies in the States. I also feel for KBJ (lady went through a hellish questioning and so many dismissed this), she deserves this because she worked for this. I realize that many of us may face similar critiques in our day to day life (whether it be general ignorance or being looked past because of the two strikes against us already), we are doing great. You are doing great. Youve got this far and nobody deserves to dim your accomplishments. Have a great night now. Sorry for any typos.

"2013-12-29",1388287333,"I Just Wanted to Apologize.","I looked through the entire comments section in this thread:

http://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/1tuj7z/professor_affirmative_action_is_helping_too_many/

There were plenty people stating that they were hurt and viewed the ""some"" of comments as hateful. I know for a fact that most of my comments are included in that ""some"" and I want to apologize for them. I didn't mean to hurt anyone with them. I don't hate black immigrants, think badly of them or want to hinder their success. I was just fed up with all of the anti-Black American sentiments I've experienced first hand and while occupying black spaces. I'm fully aware of the hate/dislike that exists on both sides. I have had to correct some relatives and Black American friends for their ridiculously ignorant statements. I've also had to correct some Africans who have said some equally ridiculously ignorant statements about Black Americans. I'm also not too fond about some of these efforts I've seen to mend and create relationships, some of them are just overkill. This is for both sides.

My experiences has caused me to become kind of wary of black immigrants. I wouldn't dare treat a random person with disrespect because they are a black immigrant. I just keep the bad sentiments of some in the back of my mind, because I have a feeling that they will eventually manifest itself. To save myself the micro aggressions, I usually try not to talk black politics or distance myself all together. If I come across you, a black immigrant, in the street I would not mean-mug you or treat you horribly. I also have no problem supporting black immigrant-owned businesses. There is a huge African and Caribbean community in my city and they have plenty of grocery stores and restaurants, some of which I go to. I frequent one Sierra Leonean restaurant and always order the cassava leaves. I speak to the owner all the time and he's very nice. I also really enjoy the blend of African/ Western fashion style coming from African designers and have been trying to get my hands on some pieces ever since. However, like I said, I still can't shake the thoughts of how some feel about Black Americans. Owners and workers at the stores I go to are either very welcoming, which I am actually surprised, or distant. They are polite, but distant. I don't know, maybe they feel the same way I do. They are probably wary of me because I am a Black American and due to their experiences. Then you just have some who can be a bit rude and I have feeling it's because of my heritage.

I also thought about my high school friend from Liberia. She used to tell me about how Black Americans and Africans used to literally beat the crap out of each constantly in her middle school. She told me really sickening stories of the fights, her younger sisters and cousins experienced the same thing. However, when I hung out over her house, they were all smiles and treated me nicely.

This is great community for black women of all different nations and cultures who can have a safe place to discuss just about anything. You ladies are also very intelligent and I really enjoy the discussions. I just don't want to make people feel othered for certain differences, when there are plenty of similarities that out weight them. I just wanted to apologize because I clearly hurt and offended people.

Back story: Upon leaving the baggage of high school pettiness, which was two years and a half after moving here with my family, I attended community college for three years and a half. **Shoutout to other Montgomery County redditors**.

I remember vividly being in classes as one or occasionally one of the three to four black students in class. I walked across buildings and cafeterias after classes by curiosity. I observed the subtle changes of demographics by department, especially the STEM, Arts, and Design buildings. Mind you, looking at the names, professors, and faculty were all these white Europeans, white Arabs, white Jews, white Latinos/as as well as the bronzed ones. I rarely saw a Black faculty \[**maybe there was, like your token Black ""*****colleague*****""**\]. My dad applied to the STEM department, with little success \[**I imagine the ""*****meritocratic*****"" BS that was shoved down his throat**\]. The only building with majority Black faculty was the African American department and sprinkles of Black coaches.

In 2016, I started delving into the topic on racism. I remember coming across several articles on that topic. It was so surface-level and theoretical that I felt so confused. I would see waves of interchangeability between Blacks, ""***PoC***"", and ""***minorities***"". I started digging and digging until 2017 where I came randomly across Black authors and writers telling their experiences \[**raw and unfiltered**\] about navigating ""***PoC***"" and ""***minority***"" spaces. It was refreshing to see those experiences matching mine (**although a Black immigrant, not native**), but felt sad that many of my native brothers and sisters in the states were brainwashed with that ""***PoC***"" and ""***minority***"" garbage.

The same ""***minorities***"" and ""***PoC***"" that gatekeep their communities from Blacks are the same ones who scream ""***PoC***"", ""***Black and Brown***"", and ""***minority***"" ***unity/coalition*** once ""***tReNdY***"" and ""***fAsHiOnAbLe***"". These ""***minorities***"" remain ""***apolitical***"" until it's inconvenient \[**like struck down and hard**\] against police reform, affirmative action, school desegregation, the fair housing act, reparations, and so on... But somehow opportunistic leeches can claim the ""***.00000000000000000000001%***"" Black in their blood. The same idiots using/weaponizing Black immigrants (**Africans precisely**) as their ""***scapegoats***"" against native ones ignoring their own dirty backyards back home \[**like they think they're sLiCk**\].

I know my experiences as someone born in the UK but raised in West Africa are the polar opposite of many brothers and sisters starting their lineage in the states against their will. I hope by luck that my ""***future***"" career allows me to lift the voiceless Black voices.

Talking about that \[**Black on Arab/Asian/Latin/Jew**\] ""***ViOlEnCe***"", where does that exaggerated anti-black propaganda come from?

I am a first generation college student and It has been a long road for me because I took so many breaks due to my mental health and lack of motivation. Every day I wonder why I am even still in college and  if it will even be worth it in the end. I am trying so hard to finish so that I can make my family proud but I keep slipping. I often feel like I am all alone when I am on campus. It is a private school and I am constantly surrounded by a sea of wealthy white kids and wealthy professors that i have zero in common with and who don't understand me or don't want to hear my voice. 

I don't really have anyone cheering me on or encouraging me, besides my parents who don't exactly encourage me but instead badger me with constant questions about when I'm going to graduate so they can brag to their friends. sometimes I feel like maybe I don't belong in university and going to college was the wrong decision for me. But then I think about the importance of having a degree as an black woman and it's pretty much the only thing keeping me going. Without some sort of degree i know that my chances of getting a good paying job are slim to none. 

When I think about how much debt I'm going to be in and the fact that even though I will have a degree I will more than likely still deal with discrimination during job searches, it makes me want to give up and drop out. I have been doing research on unemployment rates of black college grads and they are pretty high.

Since I have been in college for so long i have seriously come to realize that universities are racist institutions and they always will be. They merely tolerate our presence there because of things like affirmative action, and the fact that we would add some diversity to the student body which makes them look good. The lack of support for poc, especially poor poc once you're actually there is horrible. I do not feel as though I have learned anything of value. The most important things I have leaned as a young adult are things I've learned from reading blogs online and educating myself. My biggest regret is not going going to an hbcu. I feel like my experience would have been much different. 

I made this post because I felt like there had to be other young women like me who have had similar experiences. I originally posted this in askreddit but got very few responses. How has your college experience been? Have you actually gotten anything positive out of the experience(besides a job, obviously)? How has the post grad job hunt been for you?

1.How the fuck you as a White male homeless when your whole race has enjoyed all the benefits of privilege in America.

2.
Just the color you were born with gives you better credit than me.

3.
You asking for help(money) in a predominantly Spanish/Black part of town to uplift your White ass from homelessness but will probably talk shit about minorities and even call us spics/niggers behind closed doors.

4.
How the hell you broke/homeless, shit all you have do is show up for the interview and you will beat out any PoC for the job.

5.
They only reason you on this side of town(Spanish/Black communities) is because your own people got tired of your bumming ass and you're taking advantage(like White people do) of other races empathy, but I wonder if you would if the tables were turned?

6.
How the hell you as a White woman struggling? Especially when White woman benefit the most from Affirmative Action.

How are you struggling when all you have to do is be mediocre and praised for it while enjoying the perks, while Black women have/will work  3x harder and still look upon as average.

So as I return back from a most enjoyable holiday weekend I really have taken the time to realize that I have views that are problematic and would hate for it to stunt my growth as a rational Black man, how can I battle these thoughts when they flare up, I know I'm far from perfect and thoughts like these will blindside me but I'm curious as to what /r/blackladies problematic viewpoints are and how they combat them?","blackladies",48,"https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/3yjgow/rblackladies_what_problematic_views_do_you_have/"

I have been consistently told I am intelligent since I can remember (which is not a good parenting/teaching method and has provided plenty of its own stress).  I realize now that I am smart and perceptive but there are people who are much more smart and perceptive than me and I feel like that's ok, usually.  The usually part is because when it comes to school its a different story.  Since I was young, I have gone to school with pretty much only White and Asian American kids.  I have endured countless microagressions, subtle and not so subtle suggestions that I am ""only here because of affirmative action"", been dismissed by countless teachers and professors until I ""prove"" myself, and felt totally inadequate.  Much of this has to do with being labeled ""gifted"" when I was younger, much of this has to do with being black and feeling stupid because of being black or having to prove myself to my classmates and teachers because of being black.  So...

Ladies, what do you do to make yourself feel adequate at whatever you do, in a setting where there are no other black people, among racists, or just dealing with your own self esteem issues.

"2019-11-15",1573789976,"Reparations","I know this huge and sensitive topic especially with elections. But I am not for reparations being core of any candidates. I say because I feel the time of reparations as been passed over. I know many would disagree with me that fine. My main point is not just single entity it's combination of multiple factors.
1. During civil rights and de-segregartion reparations for families was part of the agenda the fact as blacks we many ideas that still divides. We are still fighting from within ourselves i.e family issues friends Africans/African-American or blacks or what you call ourselves.

2. With current administration it has basically changed our future elections are going. Never in my life I have see so many contenders from the Democratic parties and yet still not decided jointly who can defeat trump. I dont know if anyone is paying attention to Republican party but how many contenders have you seen stating they are challenging Trump for 2020. All of them are party or die. You might well that makes Democratic party better, well while did we lose the last election then?? If a house is divided then anyone from the outside can come and take over.  Thanks to Trumps, blacks issues have taken a back burner and now we lumped side as minorities plan. 

Back to my first point am not saying we don't have faults and shouldn't confront them. But when  everyone wants a piece of the cake we are bound to fail. Right the saving grace I smike was the Kentucky elections. I felt so happy.

3. With Trump administration, yes there those of us that lean various ways. Reparations I dont see ever happening.  There are going to be several think pieces outright condemning it and what do you think will happen at your workplace for of us that work mostly non black areas, schools, and dont think some people will think it stopped racism and would challenge it at the supreme court like Affirmative Action.


There are other thought I  have been thinking like how some of the politicians fear they are going to alienate some of supporters too, yes it's not fair to us.

"2019-04-23",1556041025,"Does this sub really have a disdain for Affirmative Action?","After looking up some information about Affirmative Action, I also saw a reddit thread on this sub with many people saying AA shouldn't have been implemented to begin with. After searching ""Affirmative Action Reddit"", I came across even more posts and comments like this from this sub. I want to present an argument, and then a question based on the premise of the argument. I myself am Asian American, so I had to fill in the box when applying for schools too you know. Anyways.

Let's start with median incomes in the US

Asians - 80K  
White - 61K  
US median - 57K  
Pacific Islander - 57K  
Hispanic/Latino - 46K  
Other races - 44K  
Native American - 39K  
Black - 38K

So basically, Affirmative Action serves to be one of many, MANY initiatives aiming to get any race under the US median TO the US median. In theory, if all humans are capable of the same achievements in our civilization then discrepancies shouldn't be this great. But it's very obvious how the median incomes drop hard between Pacific Islanders and Hispanic/Latinos, and once again down to Native Americans and Blacks considered against the ""others"" option.

It may be worth it to also present these groups by per capita income as well

Asians - 34K  
White - 32K  
Pacific Islander - 21K  
Black - 20K  
Native American - 18K  
Hispanic/Latino - 16K

Amazingly, the drop off happens after White and that's it. Black Americans aren't actually at the bottom per-capita, which probably implies that there are more people poorer than the median than richer. Just to be clear, since the per-capita incomes are all less than the medians here, ALL of America's per-capita incomes have a bell curve that skews left. [An example just to be absolutely sure we're on the same page](http://jse.amstat.org/v13n2/vonhippel_figure1.gif). It's just that some skew harder or have less of a tail, implied by the re-ordering.

Back to affirmative action. Basically, Affirmative Action is a policy implemented by certain public systems, and even the private sector, to determine who is suitable for acceptance into a school, workplace, etc. when competition is present. It leads to outcomes where if two people of similar merit went for a job, but one was from a race which has a higher per-capita income, then they might be not be favoured. This is seen as controversial by many, because it can be seen as racist.

I believe that, despite being Asian American, I don't really mind Affirmative Action as a concept. I DO believe it needs reform, especially since poor whites are left behind by these programs, but it is sound in-theory simply because the different in income stats is so great that there's CLEARLY a problem that needs fixing here just due to America's history. If initiatives aren't taken to alleviate these problems in a meritocracy, then we could end up repeating the cycle that brought us to this point, as Americans.  


1. These income ratios between races would stay the same
2. After some time, the lesser income races would get profiled as uneducated, dangerous, etc. simply due to their lower average income (even when they're middle class).
3. Successful kids from lower income races succeed, and start to favour affirmative action due to these problems.
4. Affirmative Action is implemented
5. Affirmative Action is cut due to being against the idea of a perfect meritocracy
6. Repeat?  


Let me put it this way. What would you, as a person, see as more impressive? A black kid born into a low-income neighborhood with parents that value education but absolutely toxic bullies in elementary and middle school, and they don't have the means to send their kid to a private school. This black kid has to stay away from every bad influence he meets, even if that means becoming a total outcast. Also, he starts working a job while in highschool while some of his friends flunk entirely. He gets a 3.8 average in highschool regardless. He's also shown himself to have a kind heart and a passion for helping those around him. Or. A white kid born into a family where the father does Real-Estate somewhat successfully and the mother works in IT in a small company. This white kid's parents also value education, and they're able to send him to a private school as such. He gets a 3.6 there. However, colleges weigh students from that private school as 0.4 GPA higher relative to the black kid's public school. So he would effectively be a 4.0 student in public school, in their eyes. That said, he didn't really get bullied, and most bad influences were only as bad as they needed to be without actually doing bad academically. The truly bad influences, the types of guys that will flunk out, he also avoids just like the black kid, but at a private school there aren't many of those (I went to a private school and there was only 1 guy like that, period). Overall, he's a good kid with a kind heart too. Volunteers and does service all the time. Honestly, it may be hard, but I UNDERSTAND the reason AA would pick the black kid. By giving this black kid more resources than he ever had in the past, you have the potential to make a successful black kid, then a successful black adult, and then a successful black adult who also uplifts his originally low-income neighborhood if he chooses to stay around that culture. I've seen it with my own eyes too. I go to a mosque here in Atlanta in a black neighborhood occasionally, and the adults that lead this mosque are very proper and are always making strides to give back to the community. They've pretty much changed the culture in their part of Atlanta alongside the three churches and the school in that area, through what I've gathered talking to them (they're old people). I can affirm this, because going a few blocks east or west of that neighborhood brings you to uneducated Atlanta, like Pittsburgh or Lakewood. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the context of AA for Asian Americans is that Asians have higher incomes and education, and it's HEAVILY due to the amount of vetting and barriers to immigration (AKA brain-drain from our ancestor countries ugh). But beyond this, I don't really see this as a big deal. I still got into the college I wanted to, a very prestigious one at that (Emory). In fact, my background of being the son of two doctors that went to a private school probably has something to do with it, considering I got a 3.2 in highschool. In the grand scheme of American civilization, I'm willing to have a slightly higher bar for success than others if it means that America as a whole is benefiting tenfold. Now, AGAIN, there are so many flaws with actual implemented AA, that I think prevents me from supporting it as it is now. I believe that it needs to be reformed so that it targets low-income situations much more than situations by race. There was a case of a low-income Asian being discriminated in Harvard admissions over a middle-income black kid that led to controversy a while back. In subsequent years, [movements](http://time.com/5425147/harvard-affirmative-action-trial-asian-american-students/) have been made to combat this problem, and I do agree with it to a certain extent. We need to target concentrated poverty, more or less. But otherwise I do support the mission it is trying to achieve. *The racial implications of AA only exist because #2 above happens, people make stereotypes of races based on the average income of that race and how people of those incomes usually act or live. And this leads to prejudice. If people weren't prone to casual racism, I do believe there'd be less support for AA. But is that reality? It's up to you to decide.*

Affirmative action is a crux issue within our community, so it's nice to have one of today's great minds give us their opinion on this.

One of the replies was:

&gt;  OP, I am literally BLOWN that you had the audacity to compare your struggles to that of Blacks in America. I am so sorry that you are 33% of this campus compared to the less than 10% of Blacks. It must be so hard for you to strive to make a 4.0, get perfect SAT scores and be highly involved when your race has the highest salaries in this country and can afford much more private schooling and test prep. I can't imagine what it would be like to be judged off of being in a culture where your parents preach to you about working hard for economic success versus black students who are first generation college students, and have parents that would rather encourage them to get jobs to help support the family instead of spending money they don't have on college. My sincerest apologies that you have to spend so much time focusing on school work when you reside in the best neighborhoods in this country, where black students have to worry about not falling into the common trend of young, single, motherhood, or drug money. It also must be really discouraging that all of your peers of your race are working just as hard to create peer competition that leads to more economic success whereas blacks have a culture of bullying other blacks who try to get ahead academically or literally just don't see academics as a viable option because they don't see anyone of their own race doing it. And as for representation in the media, gosh I can't even imagine. Because blacks and latinos don't have just as much misrepresentation in the media or anything. You know what's even worse, If I sat next to you in an interview for an IT job, the employer would automatically be more partial to you than me because of your race. MUST BE SO HARD TO BE EXPECTED TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF YOUR CAPABILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the above article, Asian Americans are the least likely group in the US to be promoted to management. I've asked this in a Korean-American community(more than 99% of them are 1st generation immigrants who were born and raised in Korea) and they said this is not because of racism but because 1) Asian Americans prefer remaining as an engineer rather than becoming a manager 2) 1st generation immigrants tend to lack the adequate English and communication skills to climb the corporate ladder. If they try harder to assimilate by hosting parties at their houses and watch American footballs, hockey, and basketballs(instead of soccer) and go out hunting with his or her colleagues, they will not be discriminated against at all. Also, he mentioned that Asian Americans born and raised in America do not face any institutional discrimination other than affirmative action because they understand American culture and are good with English.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you agree with these opinions? It's kind of interesting because Asian Americans born and raised in the States generally agree that there are some kinds of bamboo ceilings but 1st generation Asian Americans tend to argue that there is no racism in the States and the Asian Americans who face racism are either 1) lack the adequate manner 2) not fluent in English 3) very unlucky or 4) should blame their lack of adequate skills rather than racism.

But after years of being on Reddit, I feel like I've become pretty damn jaded. I used to think liberals were on my side; fighting for the rights of minorities and underprivileged, but Reddit seems to reinforce the idea that ideas and beliefs/actions are two separate things. 

There's so much sexist and racist shit that goes on in various topics, and the most frustrating part of it is that people actively ignore and dimiss discussion with the phrase of ""SJW"". Any article/idea that brings up white privilege or racism from whites is immediately bombareded with people claiming how difficult it is to be white, how whites are hurt from affirmative action, how being white is also just as bad as being anything else. With all of the police murders that have happened in the past year and how Reddit has turned #blacklivesmatter into a joke, I can't help but think how racist of a place this is.

For the past year or so I've subscribed to both /r/blackfellas and /r/blackladies to get more insight into the experiences of other minorities and it's been really eye opening.

"2018-06-29",1530230598,"Email from Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance - thought it was a well written summary and worth sharing","Dear H4A members,

This past week has seen a flood of coverage regarding the lawsuit against Harvard Admissions, with Asian Americans as a central focus.
 
As we have stated before, our board believes that the diversity of our campusof students, faculty, staff and curriculumis critical to a Harvard education, and we will continue to advocate on this front, including our current activism around Harvard's lack of an Asian American Studies program. We support an inclusive, whole-person admissions process that creates a student body that is diverse in many dimensions and is able to contribute to and make the most of a Harvard education. But we of course oppose quotas and any racial discrimination against Asian Americans or any students in this process. We encourage you to hold, as we do, these two separate ideas simultaneously.
 
The stakes of this lawsuit, which will likely go to trial in October, are high, as the decision could affect the future of inclusive, race-aware policies in schools, businesses and government. In an effort to get past the often inflammatory headlines, some of us have dug into the 1,000+ pages of data analysis produced by both parties in this case, which offer two very different points of view and two different statistical models bolstering those. There are many more months and perhaps years of arguments ahead, but we would like to highlight a few points.
 
For those of you not following the lawsuit closely since its filing in 2014, the case against Harvard is being led by Edward Blum, who claims that Harvards admissions policies discriminate against Asian Americans. He is an activist who has been trying to end policies that promote diversity and inclusion in many areas of American life. He was at the forefront in bringing down civil rights protections that benefited Asian Americans in the Voting Rights Act. He twice went to the Supreme Court on behalf of a white plaintiff in Fisher vs. University of Texas to end the consideration of race in admissions. After failing, he decided he needed Asian American plaintiffs, advertised for them and filed the lawsuit under the name Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA). While we agree that Harvard should not discriminate against Asian Americans or students of any race, his history gives us pause when considering his motives. We are also wary about Asian Americans being used as a wedge against other communities of color.
 
Note that SFFA's complaint seeks, in its words, ""A permanent injunction requiring Harvard to conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the decisional process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission."" Blum has said he doesn't want Admissions to know even an applicant's name. 
 
Harvard has said that without a holistic admissions process that considers race as just one factor among many factors, it cannot create a campus that is diverse enough to fulfill its educational mission. Harvards analysis argues that contrary to the narrative we hear so often, inclusive approaches vs. race-blind ones to admitting a diverse student body lead to higher academic ratings for the whole class.
 
Harvards consideration of the whole candidate includes not only an Academic Rating but also an Extracurricular Rating, an Athletic Rating and a Personal Rating. The headline news two weeks ago was around the numerical Personal Ratings that Harvard admissions officers assign each applicant, as SFFA accused Harvard of systematically depressing those scores of Asian Americans, which are in aggregate lower than those of other candidates. This New York Times story outlines those and SFFAs other major assertions.
 
Harvard, which says it opposes and denies any racial discrimination, provides analysis showing no negative association with being Asian American as an applicant and contends that there is no evidence that admissions officers attempted to lower the Personal Ratings of Asian Americans. Harvard says the Personal Rating is not a personality score, as characterized by SFFA, but rather reflects information from the applicants essays, teacher and counselor recommendations and alumni interview reports that indicate whether the applicant will be the kind of student who will contribute to Harvard in the fullest. Harvards outside expert reports that the Personal Ratings scores line up with the recommendations and the interview reports.
 
It seems difficult from the available data to prove or disprove how being Asian American might affect any of the four main ratings, all of which include subjective elements. SFFAs analysis shows that the Academic and Extracurricular Ratings come in higher than expected for Asian Americans, so is that bias too, just of a positive kind? Or are the ratings simply a result of a straight evaluation of the available information? Do biases originate earlier and creep in through the high school reports? Are many Asian Americans raised in a way that discourages developing the very qualities that Harvard is seeking? A mix of all of the above?
 
The reports raise as many questions as they answer. Our expectation is that Harvard should be vigilant about about any potential bias, conscious or unconscious, for applicants of any race. We would expect to have an Admissions Office that is diverse itself and trained to evaluate cultural context and recognize implicit bias in the reports they receive and the way they assign their own ratings. We will push Admissions to learn more, but it has been difficult during an active lawsuit to get information beyond what it is in the briefs.
 
We will continue to follow this closely, to seek answers and to keep you posted. We plan to have a plenary session addressing these issues at our Third Summit, and we hope you will join us for this chance to hear national experts on this topic. 
 
For those of you who want to geek out on the data analysis, here are links to the filings from [Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/diverse-education/statements) and [SFFA](https://studentsforfairadmissions.org/sffa-files-motion-for-summary-judgment-against-harvard/). There will be responses from each side through the summer and then the trial is expected to begin in October, so be prepared for much more data and spin. This [Times story](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/16/us/affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) captures a range of Asian Americans' views. For those of you who were in the applicant pool under examination (Classes of 2014-2019), or have children in it, the issue of whether applicant files will be publicly released is still in dispute, and we will likely be hearing more about that soon.

"2022-02-22",1645572354,"50+ years of ""Asian American"" - Has this term hurt or helped more?","""Asian American"" was coined as a term in 1968 to unite for political power, and reject the term ""oriental"". AAPI was an expansion of the term in the 1980s for the purposes of the US census. At the same time, these terms have been a contributor to the marginalization of people who aren't visible within this umbrella. With 50 years of Asian American behind us, and as a reader of r/asianamerican, do you feel like these terms have helped or harmed more?

There's significant discourse today around the disaggregation of ""Asian Americans"" within the US - especially around data. I'm pretty sold on the value of data disaggregation, but I don't have a well formed opinion about the pros and cons of umbrella terms like ""Asian American"" or ""AAPI"" when used in reference to sociopolitical issues (duly noted that data disaggregation is pretty firmly tied to these though).

[https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/](https://aapidata.com/ethnicitydata/)[https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/](https://www.californialawreview.org/the-case-for-requiring-disaggregation-of-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-data/#:~:text=Data%20disaggregation%20in%20the%20AAPI,that%20certain%20AAPI%20subgroups%20face)

On one hand, I think it's incredibly valuable to be able to unite around a convenient, shared identity (say around #stopasianhate), but when talking about issues like affirmative action, economic mobility, and generally who benefits from ""Asian American exceptionalism"", I find that when I and others use those umbrella terms, it's incredibly easy to fall into harmful generalizations (i.e. the model minority myth). I often wish that I didn't have this term Asian American to lean on, or otherwise add a million caveats, in order to describe a particular phenomenon. When I read Asian American/AAPI in news, or even just within this subreddit without those specifying qualifications, I'm immediately turned off. I find that a lot of writing can be incredibly alienating to individuals who don't fall under the predominantly visible East Asian Taft-Hartley knowledge worker type immigrant families.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999874296/6-charts-that-dismantle-the-trope-of-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/25/999874296/6-charts-that-dismantle-the-trope-of-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority)

[https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/](https://time.com/5859206/anti-asian-racism-america/)

On the other hand, it's already hard enough to feel a shared identity when so many people don't share the same culture + history to unite. Would losing out on these umbrella terms make things even worse? I imagine if every AAPI organization/fellowship/etc turned into 20 different organizations/fellowships/etc, that would have its own problems.

Honestly it feels like there's no easy way to win.

My conclusion is that it never will be easy. Terms like Asian American and AAPI come with a heavy responsibility. The reason that these terms have failed us, is that those who have reaped the benefits have not invested more into uplifting those who remain the most marginalized, and are different from popular perception. Acknowledging the diversity is not enough - we need to actively include all people that these terms intentionally or unintentionally have labeled.

What do you think? Have we gained more from having these umbrella terms or do we only end up alienating more people not captured by popular perception behind?

P.S.

American lawyer, activist, and law professor at the William S. Richardson School of Law at the University of Hawaii. Prior to her return to Hawaii, Matsuda was a professor at the UCLA School of Law and Georgetown University Law Center, specializing in the fields of torts, constitutional law, legal history, feminist theory, critical race theory, and civil rights law.

Based on an April 1990 address to the Asian Law Caucus, first published February 1993
 
An essay I came across from Matsudas Where Is Your Body? And Other Essays on Race, Gender, and the Law.


*The Asian Law Caucus is the original public interest law firm serving the Asian-American community. It was built up from scratch by young, radical lawyers who carried files in their car trunks and stayed up all night to type their own briefs. The Asian Law Caucus has changed the lives of many-poor and working people, immigrants, and troubled youth - the least advantaged in the Asian-American community. The Caucus has also made history, successfully bringing landmark cases that have changed the law and the legal system. The supporters of the Caucus include many who participated in the civil rights and antiwar movements and who have worked all their lives in coalition with other people of color. This history is what inspired the words below, delivered at a fund-raising banquet in April 1990.*

It is a special honor to address supporters of the Asian Law Caucus. Here, before this audience, I am willing to speak in the tradition of our women warriors, to go beyond the platitudes of fundraiser formalism, and to talk of something that's been bothering me and that I need your help on. I want to speak of my fear that Asian-Americans are in danger of becoming the racial bourgeoisie, and of my resolve to resist that path. 

Marx wrote of the economic bourgeoisie -- the small merchants, the middle class, the baby capitalists--who were deeply confused about their self-interest. The bourgeoisie, he said, often emulate the manners and the ideology of the big-time capitalists. They are the wannabes of capitalism. Struggling for riches, often failing, confused about the reasons why, the economic wannabes go to their graves thinking that the big hit is right around the corner.

Living in 19th century Europe, Marx thought mostly in terms of class. Living in 20th century America, in the land where racism found a home, I am thinking about race. Is there a racial equivalent of the economic bourgeoisie? I fear there may be, and I fear it may be us.

If white, historically, is the top of the racial hierarchy in America, and black, historically, is the bottom, will yellow assume the place of the racial middle? The role of the racial middle is a critical one. It can reinforce white supremacy if the middle deludes itself into thinking it can be just like white if it tries hard enough. Conversely, the middle can dismantle white supremacy if it refuses to be the middle, if it refuses to buy into racial hierarchy, if it refuses to abandon communities of Black and Brown people, choosing instead to form alliances with them.

The theme of the unconventional fundraiser talk you are listening to is, ""we will not be used."" It is a plea to Asian-Americans to think about the ways in which our communities are particularly susceptible to playing the worst version of the racial bourgeoisie role.

In thinking this, I remember my mother's stories of growing up on a sugar plantation on Kauai. She tells of the Portuguese luna or overseer. The luna rode on a big horse and ordered the Japanese and Filipino workers around. The luna in my mother's stories is a tragic-comic figure. He thinks he is better than the other workers, but he doesn't realize that the plantation owner considers the luna sub-human, just like the other workers. The stereotype of the dumb portagee persists in Hawaii today, a holdover from the days of the luna parading around the big house, cloaked in self-delusion and false pride.

The double tragedy for the plantation nisei who hated the luna is that the sansei in Hawaii are becoming the new luna. Nice Japanese girls from Manoa Valley are going through four years of college to get degrees in Travel Industry Management, in order to sit behind a small desk in a big hotel, to dole out marching orders to brown-skinned workers and to take orders from a white man with a bigger desk and a bigger paycheck who never has to complicate his life by dealing with the brown people who make the beds and serve the food.  He need only deal with the Nice Japanese Girl, ex-Cherry Blossom Queen, eager to please, who doesn't know she will never make it to the bigger desk.

The portagee luna now has the last laugh with this new unfunny portagee joke: when the portagee was the luna, he didn't have to pay college tuition to ride that horse.

I'd like to say to my sister behind the small desk, ""remember where you came from and take this pledge: we will not be used.""

There are one hundred ways to use the racial bourgeoisie. Here are some examples:

When Asian-Americans manage to do well, their success is used against others. Internally, it is used to erase the continuing poverty and social dislocation within Asian-American communities. The media is full of stories of Asian-American whiz kids. Their successes are used to erase our problems and to disavow any responsibility for them. The dominant culture doesn't know about drug abuse in our communities, about our high school dropouts, our AIDS victims.

Suggestions that some segments of the Asian-American community need special help are greeted with suspicion and disbelief. External to our communities, our successes are used to deny racism and to put down other groups. African-Americans and Latinos and poor whites are told, ""look at those Asians--anyone can make it in this country if they really try."" The cruelty of telling this to crack babies, to workers displaced by runaway shops, and to families waiting in line at homeless shelters, is not something I want associated with my genealogy. 

Yes, my ancestors made it in this country, but they made it against the odds. In my genealogy and probably in yours, are people who went to bed hungry, who lost land to the tax collector, who worked to exhaustion and ill-health, who faced pain and relocation with the bitter stoicism we call, in Japanese, ""gaman."" Many who came the hard road of our ancestors didn't make it. Their bones are still in the mountains by the tunnels they blasted for the railroad, still in the fields where they stooped over the short-handled hoe, still in the graveyards of Europe, where they fought for a democracy that didn't include them. Asian success was success with a dark, painful price. 

To use that success to discount the hardship facing poor and working people in this country today is a sacrilege to the memory of our ancestors. It is an insult to today's Asian-American immigrants, who work the double-triple shift, who know no leisure, who crowd two and three families to a home, who put children and old-folks alike to work at struggling family businesses or at home doing piece-work until midnight. Yes, we take pride in our success, but we should also remember the cost. The success that is our pride is not to be given over as a weapon to use against other struggling communities. I hope we will not be used to blame the poor for their poverty.

Nor should we be used to deny employment or educational opportunities to others.  A recent exchange of editorials and letters in the Asian-American press reveals confusion over affirmative action.  Racist anti-Asian quotas at the universities can give quotas a bad name in our community. At the same time, quotas have been the only way we've been able to walk through the door of persistently discriminatory institutions like the San Francisco fire department.  

We need affirmative action because there are still employers who see an Asian face and see a person unfit for a leadership position. In every field where we have attained a measure of success, we are underrepresented in the real power positions. And yet, we are in danger of being manipulated into opposing affirmative action by those who say affirmative action hurts Asian-Americans. 

What's really going on here? When university administrators have secret quotas to keep down Asian admissions, this is because Asians are seen as destroying the predominantly white character of the university. Under this mentality, we can't let in all those Asian over-achievers and maintain affirmative action for other minority groups. We can't do both because that will mean either that our universities lose their predominantly white character, or that we have to fund more and better universities. To either of those prospects, I say, ""why not?"" And I condemn the voices from our own community that are translating legitimate anger at ceilings on Asian admissions into unthinking opposition to affirmative action floors needed to fight racism.

In a period when rates of educational attainment for minorities and working class Americans are going down, in a period when America is lagging behind other developed nations in literacy and learning, I hope we will not be used to deny educational opportunities to the disadvantaged and to preserve success only for the privileged.

Another classic way to use the racial bourgeoisie is as America's punching bag. There is a lot of rage in this country, and for good reason. Our economy is in shambles. Persistent unemployment is creating new ghost towns, new soup kitchens, from coast to coast. The symptoms of decay--the drugs, the homelessness, the violence--are everywhere. From out of this decay comes a rage looking for a scapegoat, and a traditional American scapegoat is the oriental menace. From the Workingman's Party that organized white laborers around an anti-Chinese campaign in California in 1877, to the World War II internment fueled by resentment of the success of issei farmers, to the murder of Vincent Chin, to the terrorizing of Korean merchants in ghetto communities today, there is an unbroken line of poor and working Americans turning their anger and frustration into hatred of Asian-Americans. 

Every time this happens, the real villains--the corporations and politicians who put profits before human needs--are allowed to go about their business free from public scrutiny. And the anger that could go to organizing for positive social change goes instead to Asian-bashing.

Will we be used as America's punching bag? We can prevent this by organizing to publicize and to fight racist speech and racist violence wherever we find it. More importantly, however, Asian-Americans must take a prominent role in advocating economic justice. We must show that Asian-Americans are allies of the working poor, of the unemployed, of the ghetto teenager. If we can show our commitment to ending the economic upheaval that feeds anti-Asian sentiment, the displaced rage that terrorizes Asian-Americans will turn upon more deserving targets. If we can show sensitivity to the culture and needs of other people of color when we do business in their communities, we will maintain our welcome there, as we have in the past. I hope we can do this so we can put an end to being used as America's punching bag.

The problem of displaced anger is also an internal problem for Asian- Americans. You know the story: the Japanese pick on the Okinawans; the Chinese pick on the Filipinos; the Samoans pick on the Laotians. On the plantations we scabbed on each other's strikes. In Chinatown, we've competed over space. There are Asian men who batter Asian women, Asian parents who batter their children. There is homophobia in our communities--tied to a deep fear that we are already so marginalized by white society that any additional difference is intolerable. I've heard of straight Asian men say they feel so emasculated by white society, that they cannot tolerate assertive women or sexually ambiguous men. This is a victim's mentality; the tragic symptom of a community so devoid of self respect that it brings its anger home.

I love my Asian brothers, but I've lost my patience with malingering homophobia and sexism, and especially with using white racism as an excuse to resist change. You know, the ""I have to be Bruce Lee because the white man wants me to be Tonto"" line. Yes, the J-town boys with their black leather jackets are adorable, but the pathetic need to put down straight women, gays, and lesbians is not. To anyone in our communities who wants to bring their anger home, let's say, ""cut it out."" We will not be used against each other.

If you know Hawaiian music, you know of the ha'ina line that tells of a song about to end. This speech is about to end. It will end by recalling echoes of Asian-American resistance.

In anti-eviction struggles in Chinatowns from coast to coast and in Hawaii we heard the song, ""We Shall Not Be Moved.""  For the 90's, I want to sing, ""We Shall Not Be Used."" I want to remember the times when Asian-Americans stood side-by-side with African-Americans, Latinos, and progressive whites to demand social justice. I want to remember the multi-racial ILWU (International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Workers' Union) that ended the plantation system in Hawaii.  I want to remember the multi-racial sugar beet strikes in California that brought together Japanese, Filipino and Chicano workers to fulfill their dreams of a better life.  I want to remember the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born that brought together progressive Okinawan, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and European immigrants to fight McCarthyism and deportation of political activists.  I want to remember the San Francisco State College strike, and the Asian-American students who stood their ground in a multi-racial coalition to bring about ethnic studies and lasting changes in American academic life, changes that make it possible for me, as a scholar, to tell the truth as I see it.

In remembering the San Francisco State strike, I also want to remember Dr. Hayakawa and ask what he represented.  For a variety of historical and cultural reasons, Asian-Americans are particularly susceptible to being used by the dominant society. Nonetheless, we have resisted being used; we have joined time and again in the struggle for democracy in America. The Asian Law Caucus represents that tradition. The Caucus is a concrete manifestation of the pledge to seek a better life for the least advantaged and to work in coalition with other groups. All of you who support the Caucus help keep alive a utopian vision of a world free from racism and poverty. You honor the proudest moments in our collective histories.

When I told a friend about this speech, he sent me a newsclipping from the Chronicle about Asian-Americans as the retailer's dream.  It starts out, ""[t]hey're young, [t]hey're single, [t]hey're college educated and on the whitecollar track. And they like to shop for fun."" Does that describe you? Well, it may describe me, too. But I hope there is more to Asian-American identity than that. I hope we will be known to history as a people who remembered the hard road of their ancestors, and who shared, therefore, a special commitment to social justice.

This song is now at an end, a song of my hope that we will not be used.","asianamerican",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/5cudq1/we_will_not_be_used_are_asianamericans_the_racial/"

Disclaimer is that I am 23 F Chinese American (upper middle class family) and my bf is 25M Vietnamese (child of refugees, working class).

I am currently in a stable relationship with a man I absolutely love. he is emotionally intelligent, does 50% and more of the housework, is smart, and has fulfilling hobbies. We currently live together with a dog. There are no issues in our relationship and if there are petty arguments, they are resolved in 30 minutes. So far I have visited his family twice and I have not sensed any fundamental moral problems in the family and they are really funny and love me as their own. 

However, his family is more traditionally minded, which means that I am policed about the way I dress, if I do less chores than him (for example, if he does the dishes after we all eat rather than me) they'll say something about it, and just general East Asian conservatism and gender roles. His mom pulled me aside several times about the way I dressed over the holidays (I was wearing baggier winter clothing during the holiday season, like a grey hoodie or an oversized sweater) and said that I need to look better or else other people will gossip about the family, or I cannot look ""bigger than him"", or that I need to dress up to keep him because men will look elsewhere if women do not dress up, or I need to dress up before I have children because ""things will sag"". One other time during the same trip she said don't come back if you are as big (body wise) as you are this year. (I am 5 7 and 150 pounds, which I guess is obese by asian standards, and most of this weight I gained due to mental health issues over the years which I did not reveal to her, and I have lost a lot of it already due to recovery from aforementioned issues). Just lectures like that which my own mom probably would never say to me in such an old schooled way, let alone someone her kid is dating.

However, his mom has also been really sweet and caring. She makes me amazing food and cares about my health, what I am doing, and make jokes with me. His entire family is very kind, hardworking, and went through some serious ish to settle down in America. As someone who is from a less traditional Asian family I am seriously kind of baffled about this contradiction between these gender role oriented comments and the lovely actions they have. Over time I have also became much closer with her just from sharing our times together, and she also tells me a lot about her past. My bf's family is also insanely tight knit and cooperative, and the kids do chores, and the guys in the family help out with chores and housework which is really amazing. 

My own mom is more ""words of affirmation"" oriented, she compliments me a lot and she is also more Western. She was also a single mom which contributed to her ""independent woman"" mindset. So I was quite surprised about my bf's mom. 

I have spoken with my boyfriend several times about this. My boyfriend apologetically explained that it's just ""the way his family has been raised, they are already more progressive than their own elders, and he has argued w them so much over the years"" and that ""in their mind, they just want you to be better, what you can do is you learn from what's good about what she said and ignore what's bad about it"" but it left a pretty uncomfortable taste in my mouth because as a woman, I feel like my experience in this situation is different from his. He probably does not have to feel the negative impact of gender roles the way I do. I also felt bad because what if I get married to this family, and the negative feelings get worse? However, is this also a normal part of any relationship? So I thought I'd ask this thread how you guys think. Is this a red flag or should I deal with it? Anybody else has a similar experience? Advice?","asianamerican",20,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/105fx43/need_advice_and_insights_on_traditional_mother_in/"

"2014-01-14",1389675579,"[Discussion] I don't see why the affirmative action issue is constantly framed as a conflict of interest between minorities.","When I see AAs arguing against affirmative action, most immediately go with the assumption that this is a conflict between minorities. They see their opponents are other underprivileged minorities who gets all the positions that they didn't get. The proposed solution that they give is always complete abolition, which I see as unlikely, especially in more liberal states.

I think the angle of approach to this issue needs to change in order to convince more people. Don't think of this problem as a dog-eat-dog contest between minorities. There are actually fairly good arguments for helping historically disadvantaged African Americans and Hispanics. It is hard to defeat it.

Instead the really unfair part of affirmative action (for me) is the fact that AAs actually have a HARDER time than Caucasians in this system. This makes absolutely no sense. Caucasians get white privilege, pre-existing old-boy social networks and historical legacy benefits, while AAs suffered historical discrimination and higher poverty rate, AND they should be given an even harder time now compared to white people? I am really surprised and disgruntled that this is not pointed out more whenever affirmative action is brought up.

If the admission rates of Caucasians and AAs for colleges are on the same level adjusted for test score (or in some better measure of admission equality, we are equal), I would be perfectly fine with affirmative action. It is a reasonable statement that white people don't need a crutch in life over Asians, right?

This point could have been chewed to death in some AA blog circles. I haven't been in the AA activism community for too long, so it is likely that I missed it. However, I have never seen it presented online, so I thought to get some discussions on it.","asianamerican",40,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1v63z3/discussion_i_dont_see_why_the_affirmative_action/"
"2013-08-07",1375846976,"Affirmative Action  Harming Asians Most","I hate how Asians are stereotyped as being superior to Whites in college admissions, which forces them to limit their ranges of Asian students in incoming classes. That combined with the need to have diverse females and males screws over Asians. I was told by a former UPenn admissions officer that the worst demographic to be is Asian Male for all the reasons you can think of.

The NYT article Little Asia on the Hill explores the little known problem of Affirmative Action that affects Asian Americans. The article begins by describing how UC Berkley had a record high for Asians in their freshman class and what it was like for a student to be among such a large population of Asian students in the university.

&gt;    But 10 years after California passed Proposition 209, voting to eliminate racial preferences in the public sector, university administrators find such balance harder to attain. At the same time, affirmative action is being challenged on a number of new fronts, in court and at state ballot boxes. And elite colleges have recently come under attack for practicing it  specifically, for bypassing highly credentialed Asian applicants in favor of students of color with less stellar test scores and grades.

There have been long running suspicions among the Asian American community that they were often denied admission or wait-listed to make room for other students considered to be disadvantaged minorities. I find it interesting that although universities pride themselves on being tolerant and diverse, their admissions office uses a combination of stereotypes and impossible standards to create what they believe to be an incoming class with perfect diversity. It seems absurd that admissions officials would assess an Asian student at a much higher standard than his White counterparts because they are a supposedly superior Model Minority while judging African-Americans and Hispanics at a much lower standard using Whites as a neutral benchmark because they are implied to be inferior disadvantaged minorities. Additionally, it is even more racist to use Whites as a neutral standard in judging which groups are superior to receive harder burdens from the admissions officers, while using a lesser standard on the other groups, which appear to reaffirm the age-old American perception that Asians are superior while Blacks/Hispanics are not.

&gt;    Asians have become the new Jews, in the phrase of Daniel Golden, whose recent book, The Price of Admission: How Americas Ruling Class Buys Its Way Into Elite Colleges  and Who Gets Left Outside the Gates, is a polemic against university admissions policies. Mr. Golden, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is referring to evidence that, in the first half of the 20th century, Ivy League schools limited the number of Jewish students despite their outstanding academic records to maintain the primacy of upper-class Protestants. Today, he writes, Asian-Americans are the odd group out, lacking racial preferences enjoyed by other minorities and the advantages of wealth and lineage mostly accrued by upper-class whites. Asians are typecast in college admissions offices as quasi-robots programmed by their parents to ace math and science.

&gt;    As if to illustrate the point, a study released in October by the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy group opposing race-conscious admissions, showed that in 2005 Asian-Americans were admitted to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at a much lower rate (54 percent) than black applicants (71 percent) and Hispanic applicants (79 percent)  despite median SAT scores that were 140 points higher than Hispanics and 240 points higher than blacks.

&gt;    To force the issue on a legal level, a freshman at Yale filed a complaint in the fall with the Department of Educations Office of Civil Rights, contending he was denied admission to Princeton because he is Asian. The student, Jian Li, the son of Chinese immigrants in Livingston, N.J., had a perfect SAT score and near-perfect grades, including numerous Advanced Placement courses.

&gt;    This is just a very, very egregious system, Mr. Li told me. Asians are held to different standards simply because of their race.

&gt;    To back his claim, he cites a 2005 study by Thomas J. Espenshade and Chang Y. Chung, both of Princeton, which concludes that if elite universities were to disregard race, Asians would fill nearly four of five spots that now go to blacks or Hispanics. Affirmative action has a neutral effect on the number of whites admitted, Mr. Li is arguing, but it raises the bar for Asians. The way Princeton selects its entering class, Mr. Li wrote in his complaint, seems to be a calculated move by a historically white institution to protect its racial identity while at the same time maintaining a facade of progressivism.

&gt;    Private institutions can commit to affirmative action, even with state bans, but federal money could be revoked if they are found to be discriminating. Mr. Li is seeking suspension of federal financial assistance to Princeton. Im not seeking anything personally, he says. Im happy at Yale. But I grew up thinking that in America race should not matter.

Affirmative Action is not a Black and White issue as most people are led to believe although it seems that way because of the lack of Asian voices in this controversial issue. The 2005 study also pointed out that Asian applicants had to score at least 50 points higher on the SAT than other applicants just to get an equal chance for admission Blacks and Hispanics still have a strong chance even if they score 200 and 185 points below other applicants. The URL to access the Princeton study is http://opr.princeton.edu/faculty/Tje/EspenshadeSSQPtII.pdf

I am troubled that elite universities in the past have limited admission from Jewish students in a sad attempt to preserve WASP culture and now I am troubled that universities are making an effort to limit Asian students in an attempt to promote diversity to accommodate certain minorities. What is more disturbing is that Asians as a minority group have lower admission rates than other defined minority groups in universities despite meeting or exceeding admission requirements. After universities such as Berkeley removed Affirmative Action, diversity was still intact except there was a decrease of certain minority groups that would have gotten in from this generally flawed system.

&gt;    Ive heard from Latinos and blacks that Asians should not be considered a minority at all, says Elaine Kim, a professor of Asian-American studies at Berkeley. What happened after they got rid of affirmative action has been a disaster  for blacks and Latinos. And for Asians its been a disaster because some people think the campus has become all-Asian.

In spite of all the controversy, Affirmative Action is actually promoting racial tensions to a large extent. It had been noted that Whites who complained about Affirmative Action sound like racists, now African-Americans and Hispanics who complain about the removal of the system are developing hostile attitudes towards Asians who have been increasingly admitted in universities that have merit-based admissions in their place. At the same time, diversity has dropped which does take away from the college experience for a large extent based on observations on Busch and Livingston campus versus the diverse student life on College Avenue.

&gt;    One leading critic of bringing affirmative action back to Berkeley is David A. Hollinger, chairman of its history department and author of Post-Ethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism. He supported racial preferences before Proposition 209, but is no longer so sure. You could argue that the campus is more diverse now, because Asians comprise so many different cultures, says Dr. Hollinger. A little more than half of Asian freshmen at Berkeley are Chinese, the largest group, followed by Koreans, East-Indian/Pakistani, Filipino and Japanese.

&gt;   Dr. Birgeneau agrees on at least one point: I think were now at the point where the category of Asian is not very useful. Koreans are different from people from Sri Lanka and theyre different than Japanese. And many Chinese-Americans are a lot like Caucasians in some of their values and areas of interest.

The system used to categorise minorities is also flawed. Both individuals point out that Asians are made up of several ethnic groups such as Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and Vietnamese and it is extremely insulting to consider each ethnicity as one and the same. Despite this, Hollinger makes a valid point that diversity did not decrease when Affirmative Action was abolished in those university, but it actually grew due to the increased numbers of Asians that are able to mingle with one another more than ever.

Personally, I would replace race-based affirmative action with socioeconomic affirmative action containing a merit-based component. I think that affirmative action should address actual inequity, rather than historical inequity faced by others of the same skin color. So if we can address socioeconomic disadvantage, there is no reason use old stereotypes to set different admission standards for minorities at the expense of Asians.","asianamerican",26,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/1juzmv/affirmative_action_harming_asians_most/"

"2022-02-17",1645084351,"An observation about gun ownership and hate crimes","As Asian Americans, we are all increasingly scared to walk down the street in fear of getting stabbed, hit with a blunt object, shot at, shoved in front of a vehicle, etc. A big problem is that there are no immediate remedies to this. You could not go outside and work remotely, but you might need to go to the store or something. It is also uncertain whether the soft on crime laws will be changed or repealed. This leaves gun ownership as a readily attainable solution... You don't have a constitutional right to safety, but under Supreme Court decisions DC v Heller and McDonald v Chicago, you do have a constitutional right to home gun ownership for the purpose of self defense. Most states also have conceal carry permits that are easy to get... Don't get me wrong though. In order to end Asian hate crimes, of course this is not the sole solution, but it could be one of many things individuals can do. Gun ownership is also very political these days, but the issue of whether one should take on gun ownership in an increasingly dangerous situation, like whether affirmative action is beneficial or not, is something that should be contemplated and its merits should be scrutinized without the political perspectives sabotaging any sincere conversations that can bring us some useful insights...

For some more context about myself, I'm a college student from NYC but I go to school in Boston. So when I am at home in NYC I feel extremely unsafe. I can walk outside where I live in Boston at 2AM without a problem. But whenever I go outside in NYC which usually involves walking a distance of at least like a few blocks, taking public transportation, etc, I come across people where they should not even be where they are, and extremely often. It is not usual for like 5 homeless people to be in a crowded subway in an average neighborhood at like 3PM, and if you are an Asian person, you know what is likely to happen next. So I am thinking about applying for a gun permit and purchasing a gun. But in NYC in particular, you cannot conceal carry the gun, you can only keep it in your home. Okay, fine. But if there are like 10 threats that you face on a daily basis and you are able to deal a slight blow on the amount of danger you face, no matter how small, I feel it is very logical to take that countermeasure. Of course, even owning a gun is not a passive action. You have to go to a gun range every month and there are a lot of maintenance duties associated with owning a gun. But if you are not willing to allot some effort for self defense in this environment, theoretically, it may speak poorly on your choice of what to consume at the current time and your expectation about the future.

So here is my question to you guys:  
Do you own a gun or know someone who owns a gun? Do you take it outside or just keep it in the home?   
Do you live in a gun friendly state or a gun restrictive state? What about soft on crime or hard on crime states?  
What is your calculus in response to the rise of Asian hate crimes? What is your proposed countermeasure, especially if you are anti-gun?","asianamerican",25,"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/sujd6e/an_observation_about_gun_ownership_and_hate_crimes/"

&gt; * Indians [post-generation] are generally politically right-wing throughout Canada/Australia/Europe. We support capitalism, globalism, social liberalism, and islamophobia. I am vocally against the socialist-left and affirmative action [as is given to Muslims and Blacks].

&gt; * Westernized South Indians generally do not find North Indains or Pakistanis attractive. A lot of racism exists between Indians and Pakistanis. A lot of us dislike Bollywoodesque racism.

&gt; * Indians generally have no reason to drop their cultural/religious heritage. A lot of Hindu organizations even supported gay marriage before it became trendy in the west, but I personally disagree with gay marriage.

&gt; * Pakistanis are racially Middle Eastern. They simply dislike the idea of being ""Muslim"" and ""Middle Eastern""; if you speak to straight Pakistanis in more liberal areas, they're happy to identify as ""Middle Eastern"". They shouldn't be used to **represent** South Asian peoples - it's racist.

&gt; * India [and Non-Muslim Asia, like Singapore] still suffers from causal homophobia dervied from colonial-christian educational morals, and it's a duty of the western countries responsbile for the regression (United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Spain, Netherlands, and any associated countries) to reverse the homophobia installed by their ancestors.

Although thankfully, the interactions I've had with society have been 99% of the time pleasant and cordial, I've always noticed that AAs are always screwed over by entities and policies that are sometimes even designed to curb discrimination. I've always for some unknown reason feel that, just us Asians in general need to do a great deal to ""prove"" ourselves before society can accept us. I don't know if I'm too indulgent on victim mentality but allow me to cite a few examples off the top of my head:

1. Harvard's taking of affirmative-action to the extreme where a lot of AAs are singled out
2. Not enough pushback from people and governmental entities for crimes committed against AAs
3. Not enough coverage from MSM for racially motivated crimes against AAs
4. With relation to point 1, the fact that AA are no longer on the list of ""diversity quotas"" companies and colleges have to fulfill.

On the other side of the camp, you have actual AAs speaking very positively about their experience being American, and how they feel accepted and very much loved by the community. I've only heard bits and pieces from both sides so far, so I'd very much like to know what it's like to live as an AA because I don't know what to believe.

"2020-01-03",1578025850,"32yo MD, PhD post-doc, struggling to see a path forward for a career in research, asking for some advice.","I'm a 32 year old post-doc from Europe (MD, PhD, resident in Pathology) in a successful cancer research lab at a prestigious US university. Previous post-docs in the lab were able to do multiple, different projects, as in the beginning, the PI was dependent on collaborations with other researchers. The PI is very well-known in the field I thought that I would be able to learn a lot in the lab. I was initially put on a project, where the PI got a lot of money for, however collaborators did not provide the required specimens (cancer tissues). Initially, I also contributed tissue from my university in Europe, but this was not enough. Although i was not told before I was in the lab, I was hired to do micro-dissection on the samples for this project (since I am a resident in pathology). However, a year after I started, another project was published in one of the CNS journals and all focus  moved to that project: a company was founded and everybody is working on validating the initial study (often brainless work, that I think should be done in the company and not by the cheap labor of grad-students).

(I don't want to brag, but this is my honest assessment:) I'm the most qualified person in the lab: I do both all my lab work and the analyses (which are often computational intensive: I know how to program (python, R) and how to run NGS-analyses pipelines, before I joined the lab). Since my initial project failed, I'm now being used in the same 'pipeline' as grad students (but I don't get as much one-on-one time as grad-students). and I don't get the opportunity to develop my own ideas.

I have asked a researcher outside the lab for advice and he referred me to the 'Avoid Boring People'-book from James Watson (more specifically to the passage where Watson decided to leave his PI, because he didn't think he was learning the things he wanted to learn). I'm thinking of moving back to Europe with my wife (American), who also wants to leave the university (she is a research associate). When I told the PI that I might leave the lab by the end of 2020, he told me he wanted to support me later, which he has done for another post-doc, who is now a PI under him. However, the PI has never 'mentored' me and he has never given me advice. Before I joined the lab, he asked me to fill out an 8-page questionnaire, which I'm sure he never read (with questions like: ""where do you see yourself in 5 years""). In the year before I joined the lab, I had thought about 2-3 projects which I wanted to propose, but he has never had time to listen to them and give his views on them. I don't want to be grand-fathered into a position without having a good paper by myself: these promises in the future set me up for a subordinate role where I can't develop my ideas and where I have to subscribe to the scientific consensus. I know my pathology and computational biology skills are in high-demand and I might have gone to a 'too-good' lab that doesn't value me. I feel like a failure, but I'm also eager to proof that I can be successful, even in a market with less grant-money, like the EU. I still very much respect my PI for his scientific achievements and his vision. But the lack of investment in the 'future' like in young researchers, bothers me. It hate how the reward system works for PIs: risky projects where only a small percentage succeed, are better for a PI than helping all their grad-students and post-docs succeed in their dreams of a scientific career. I have spoken with some of the bright grad-students and post-docs, who have expressed similar complaints.

I'm generally disappointed in research: it has become industrial and top-down, which makes it very uninteresting for grad-students and post-docs. In Europe, I had very interesting and intellectual and conceptual discussions with my bosses, about how to do elegant and creative research. In the US institute where I'm now, it is about processing hundreds of samples and being a brainless robot. I see how people who are brainless robots and who have no creative mind at all, have been promoted to tenure-track positions. They don't get any national grants and live from the money from millionaires who were directed to them by the head of the department, who 'believes' in these brainless robots (sometimes because of positive discrimination/affirmative action). It is easier to convince a millionaire who cannot assess how good the research-proposal is, to give money, then to convince your peers...","academia",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/eja7tv/32yo_md_phd_postdoc_struggling_to_see_a_path/"
"2023-07-31",1690836052,"UC Office of Student Conduct retaliation against unionized workers","One of my friends was involved in the UAW 2865 collective action earlier this year which triggered retaltiation against union activity by the UC admin.

Timeline of events for this scenario:

\-during 2022 UAW 2865/5810 strike one of the workers striked with their coworkers

\-manager of that one worker illegally retaliated against the worker for striking, threatening the worker's status at the institution after performing work duties just fine up to the date of the strike

\-workers made mild and medium appeals to stop the retaliation, to deaf ears

\-after months of trying 'proper channels' to adress issue with no progress, workers decided collective action was needed

\-gathered to protest at the manager's place of work

\-manager refused to engage with the underlying issue, called the corporate police, fled the scene

\-corporation then used resources such as a sham 'judicial' process to retaliate further against workers, singling out workers who stood in solidarity with the original worker

\-now many of the workers involved have been put on 'probation', told they are not able to protest or engage in labor activity without further consequences, and have to write an essay

&amp;#x200B;

............needless to say this whole situation stinks of unconstitutional abuse of power by the corporation. 

I encourage you to read the essay attached to this post since it goes into the long list of legal precedents as well as contract language. The essay is what one of my friends who has been targetted by this union retaliation has written in response to the university's behavior

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: UC is incurring incredible legal liability upon itself by refusing to follow the plain-face reading of law such as the constitution, centuries of precedent in federal and state, and the language of the contract itself which reinforces the language of the mentioned laws. This retaliation does not make their workers more productive or happy, and comes off as blatant abuse of institutional power to crush union activity

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Prompt: You are required to write a research paper about the resources to make informed decisions about engaging in expressive activity, differences between speech forums, how your conduct impacted others, and how you would perceive the conduct if it had been directed at you

&amp;#x200B;

Feuds throughout history are fueled from the low level of economic inconvenience to all out war. Thankfully living in a time where disagreements have many avenues of peaceful resolution, we still find consistent provocatory violence meant to extend feudal unpleasantry ad infinitum. Both sides feeling the aggrieved need to retaliate &amp; escalate; however, asymmetry of power and tactics often exists. Institutional &amp; economic asymmetry as primary sources of aforementioned dynamics ie the have-nots want a decent standard of living while the haves seek to defend their castle.

The context of the case is an organization primarily consisting of a group of striking workers, striking after months unfair labor practices,bad faith bargaining &amp; retaliation, from the corporation. One worker in particular had his status of belonging threatened by a manager, despite performing duties adequately up until the strike. Then upon legal sanction of said strike ideally protected the worker from retaliation for their position, in other words their labor rights ideally protected their status. Yet the retaliation was levied by the manager against mild and medium levels of protest at first, all proper channels eventually being exhausted to lift the managers charge then leading to organization among workers about how to address the abuse. Consensus came to of the illegality under statutes such as NLRA, FLSA, California Labor Code Section 923, FEHA, etc& the workers decided given the context of failure of proper channels that collective action was needed, such as a protest, in order to protect their coworker. The workers temporarily paused the other work, which most would rather be doing but felt the need to defend their rights, in order to brief the case to each other &amp; petition the manager for redress. The manager reported these workers to the authorities and fled the scene, choosing to continue abusing the worker. Certain workers were singled out from the collective for further abuse and retaliation. This document is a product of this process pursued to punish organized labor. 

So on to exploring the history of expressive activity, the precedent for free speech and assembly, how conduct impacts others, how an ethical actor might compose themselves under the principles of utilitarian consequentialism. For a too long dont read summary I would say if workers protested my managerial abuse, I might consider how to redress and resuscitate relations between all parties in order to establish a healthy, productive working environment. Consider not committing illegal acts retaliating against workers striking underneath me, instead advocating on their behalf if their case is reasonable and sound, resolving the underlying issue to the best of my ability. Not only the right thing to do given the case, but avoids all ripple effects such as legal liability, which institution ultimately cares about, &amp; healthy work environment. 

Any advocate of the aspirational principles within our founding such as the bill of rights would agree the right to protest, engage in organized labor activity, and not be harassed or retaliated against for engaging in such activities is protected under the law, but effective enforcement of these rights often requires taking proactive measures beyond traditional channels. This dynamic is at the heart of our nation. There is no need to continue this feud, sirs and ladies; no need to abuse our interdependence. 

	The right to protest is foundational in U.S. law and is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning religion, expression, assembly, and the right to petition. ""Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."" Thus, the right to protest by expressing discontent and assembling peacefully has been an integral part of American democracy since its inception. Another critical case of precedent is Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), where the court ruled that students do not lose their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate, illustrating the wide reach of First Amendment protections. Given the context that the workers in question wore multiple hats, one of which being student; however, their primary role at the corporation was to teach and conduct research, but such are graduate studies. California also strongly upholds the right to protest. The state's constitution contains an affirmative right to free speech and assembly which is interpreted more broadly than the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, the Tom Bane Civil Rights Act in California penalizes anyone who interferes with another's constitutional rights through threats, intimidation, or coercion. This act can extend to situations involving protest rights.

	In our case, workers utilized their right to protest in response to a perceived injustice. We had the right to gather, express our views, and request a peaceful resolution. The retaliation we face following our protest raises questions about whether our rights are adequately respected &amp; upheld.

	Since the case in question is regarding union activity even more legal precedent applies for speech. Labor rights, including the right to form and join labor unions, strike, and engage in collective bargaining, are fundamental rights in the U.S. The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, is a cornerstone of American labor law. It established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and gave it the power to enforce employees' rights to collectively bargain and organize. The Act also prevents employers from committing unfair labor practices that might discourage organizing or discriminate against union members. Under the NLRA, employees have the right to engage in ""concerted activities"", which include strikes, for mutual aid or protection. California has several laws that further enhance labor rights. The California Labor Code, for instance, has numerous sections that protect union activity and prohibit employer interference with such activity. Additionally, the Meyers-Milias-Brown Act gives local government employees in California the right to organize and bargain collectively, with UC running nearly a dozen company towns across the state, the largest employer in California some years. The point being made that this law would seem applicable under the interpretation that UC is highly interconnected with governmental structures and often runs a local government proxy within their university districts. More importantly the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act (HEERA) extends similar legal protections to employees of the University of California, California State University, and the state's community colleges within a standalone law. Needless to say our current situation might serve as a case study in the regulated socioeconomic dynamics. 

	Regarding harassment and retaliation we find the following legal context.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and also prohibits retaliation against individuals who assert their rights under the law. Individuals in this case come from diverse backgrounds, with the primary worker of interest being a protected class from amongst these, specificity to which lacking for identity protection but suffice to say the universitys threat upon his career was beyond just losing a job hence the protected class. California's Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits harassment and discrimination in employment because of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, mental and physical disability, medical condition, age, pregnancy, denial of medical and family care leave, or pregnancy disability leave. It also prohibits retaliation against individuals who assert their rights under the law. Furthermore, the California Labor Code contains several sections that specifically prohibit retaliation against employees for a variety of protected activities. For example, Section 1102.5 prohibits employer retaliation against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency when the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal statute. 

So much legal precedent! The heart of the feud beginning with the individual worker and individual manager is particularly about discrimination related to one of these protected classes, again not specifying which for purposes of identity protection. The corporation was using its infrastructural advantage to isolate and threaten one of the most vulnerable workers in the southernmost company town to leave the picket line. 

	This is all in the context of failure of proper channels which had fallen short for months to resolve the underlying issue and continued to load the corporation in question with high level legal liability, up to the constitutional level. Such proper channels being the student appealing the decision with the professor as well as the department, demonstrating the illegality of the decision, finding ambassadors among the faculty and staff to try and resolve the situation, expressing the grievance to colleagues and coworkers to reach out themselves in a peaceful stochastic manner to the professor and admin, trying over and over for months to peacefully appeal the onerous decision, filing grievances and other legal documentation, continued communications, etc&.. No progress, stonewall, threats of further retaliation. Most grievances find no plasticity from the corporation until the issue is taken to arbitration at huge expense to both sides which almost inevitably goes towards the workers common sense, plain-face reading of the contractual language &amp; case law. The corporationg often favors dragging out the process for months &amp; months. This is what proper channels often look like; hence collective action to enforce labor rights, contract agreements, dignity for the victim &amp; the abuser, legal upstanding of the institution, and work environment health ie productivity. 

The workers met the manager while working with a second manager &amp; a small group of company town citizens, politely requesting to have a moment of his time while the second manager led the meeting as he professed he had been doing already up until the interruption. The manager refused to engage the underlying issue, contacted corporate security, and fled the scene. Now months later the corporation has singled out and harassed members of that protest, initiated a similar harassment campaign upon another group of workers x7 the size, and even violated the 4th amendment by arresting and detaining worker citizens of the company town without filing any charges ie undue seizure. Use of institutional power to act outside of the basic law of the land in case after case, creating company town kangaroo courts to put the singled out subjects to a trial where the process and outcome are not about justice but isolation, ostracization , and to send a message to all others who might dissent even in defense of their coworkers. This is the response workers get for simplying requesting bosses follow the law and the negotiated contract. 

	As for the perception of the incident, theres a few parties to consider. Most of the younger corporate citizens and workers were actually well known to the members of the protest. I for example immediately identified a handful of the dozen or so people upon entering the workplace environment in question. Their response was confusion but then mostly positive affirmation, amusement &amp; some admiration was expressed later for our defense of each other. The managers were absolutely appalled, breathless in shock. Despite being experts of highly complex fields &amp; dynamics, they didnt seem to be able to comprehend how the dynamics of socioeconomic &amp; constitutional law which the violation of was the subject of the workers message, with a written notice &amp; highly peaceful ambassadorship. The managers filed a corporate report, choosing to trial the workers in the underclass of the company town despite the workers special status under legally binding contract &amp; all of the above legal precedent. Yet another form of harassment. One would think the corporation would rather the workers have more time to work within their specialized skillset as hired for, rather than meaningless administrative bureaucracy as a form of retaliation &amp; blatant contractual mis-alignment. As for the broader corporation by far more people would, upon hearing both sides of the story, tend to side with resolution of worker rights as is the baseline of societal trust. As was the response to vast majorities of the wider public for scenarios such as these. At the end of the day arguing ad populum, ie perception or optics, is folly given the existence of basic ethics so the reader might wonder why was this even a question of the prompt? 

	Again, needless to say, I dont overtly and intentionally abuse the underclasses of workers below me, and if a collective of them pointed out my illegality in actually committing such acts I would seek immediate remedy. In other words, if this happened to me I wouldnt sadistically retaliate, fleeing my own illegality under labor law if I was the manager. So many reasons why to choose an ameliorative response, too exhaustive to expand upon basic ethics and law. The bill of rights is taught to elementary and middle school children. 

	Also as a final note, we havent even delved into the detail of the contract since the legal precedent is comprehensive enough; however, for the curious the most relevant clauses of the contract would be, within the Non-Discrimination in Employment, the University shall not discriminate against or harass any ASE/GSR on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, national origin, ancestry, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, gender expression, gender transition status, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, HIV status, uniformed service, age, citizenship, political affiliation, and/or union activity. Another nail being driven into the coffin, the recommended action moving forward would be for workers to continue emphasizing nonviolence as they protest for redress of grievances, and for the corporation to avoid legal liability by following the terms of the contract, state law, and federal statutes. 

Thank you for the opportunity to review foundational rights.
