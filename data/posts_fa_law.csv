**Important Petitions** 

For those of you who follow petition orders today was a big day for one particular case: recess appointments!

""NLRB V. NOEL CANNING, ET AL. -The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. In addition to the questions presented by the petition, the parties  are directed to brief and argue the following question: Whether 
the President's recess-appointment power may be exercised when the Senate is convening every three days in pro forma sessions.""

Should be a fun case to watch next year.

**Opinions-**

**Vance v. Ball State (Alito writes, 5-4)**


*Issue:* Whether the supervisor liability rule established by Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth (i) applies to harassment by those whom the employer vests with authority to direct and oversee their victims daily work, or (ii) is limited to those harassers who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote, transfer, or discipline their victim.


*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that an employer is a supervisor for vicarious liabilty under Title VII only if she has the power given by the employer to take tangible employment actions against the victim. "" In Vance, the Court rejects the EEOC interpretation of who counts as a supervisor. In Vance, the Court defines 'tangible employment action' to include actions that have a 'significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.' ""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-556_11o2.pdf)

* The Seventh Circuit is affirmed. 

* Justice Ginsburg writes the dissent with Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan joining. 

* Supreme Court veteran Lyle Denniston has [pre-opinion analysis](http://www.scotusblog.com/?p=155622) over at SCOTUSblog.

**Mutual v. Bartlett (Alito writes,5-4 )**

*Issue*: Whether the First Circuit Court of Appeals erred when it created a circuit split and held  in clear conflict with this Courts decisions in PLIVA v. Mensing, Riegel v. Medtronic, and Cipollone v. Liggett Group  that federal law does not preempt state law design-defect claims targeting generic pharmaceutical products because the conceded conflict between such claims and the federal laws governing generic pharmaceutical design allegedly can be avoided if the makers of generic pharmaceuticals simply stop making their products.

*Opinion Summary:* The Court holds that design defect claims under state law that turn on the adequacy of a drug's warnings are preempted by federal law under PLIVA.

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-142_8njq.pdf)

* First Circuit Reversed 

* Justice Breyer dissents joined with Kagan and Sotomayor dissents joined by Ginsburg. 

-----

**U.S. v. Kebodoeux (Breyer writes, 7-2)** 

*Issue:* (1) Whether the court of appeals erred in conducting its constitutional analysis on the premise that respondent was not under a federal registration obligation until the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) was enacted, when pre-SORNA federal law obligated him to register as a sex offender; and (2) whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Congress lacks the Article I authority to provide for criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2250(a)(2)(A), as applied to a person who was convicted of a sex offense under federal law and completed his criminal sentence before SORNA was enacted.

*Opinion Summary*: Registration requirement under SORNA as applied to Kebodeaux falls within the scope of Congress's authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

*Opinion Summary Furthered:* Mike Gottlieb: ""United States v. Kebodeaux is a case about the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SONRA), which requires federal sex offenders to register in the States where they live. Defendant was convicted of a sex offense, but had already served his sentence and been discharged when SONRA was enacted. The question in the case was whether Congress had the power to enact SONRA's registration requirements and apply them to an offender who had already completed his sentence when SONRA was enacted. The Court holds that Congress had that power under the Necessary and Proper Clause. The Court's opinion in Kebodeaux turns in significant part on the fact that the defendant was still subject to registration requirements under the federal Wetterling Act when he was released. As a result, the registration requirements of SONRA merely modified existing legal requirements. 'Congress could reasonably conclude that registration requirements applied to federal sex offenders after their release can help protect the public from those federal sex offenders and alleviate public safety concerns.' ""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-418_7k8b.pdf)

* The Fifth Circuit is reversed and remanded. 

* Justice Scalia and Thomas dissent. 

----

**Fisher v. UT-Austin (Kennedy writes, 7-1)**

*The decision is fairly narrow, Justice Thomas writes in his concurring opinion he would have overturned the landmark affirmative action case Grutter.*

*Issue:* Whether this Courts decisions interpreting the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including Grutter v. Bollinger, permit the University of Texas at Austins use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions.

*Opinion Summary:* Because the Fifth Circuit did not hold the university to the demanding burden of strict scrutiny articulated in Grutter and Bakke, its decision afffiming the district court's grant of summary judgment was incorrect.  From Kennedy: ""Strict scrutiny does not permit a court to accept a schools assertion that its admissions process uses race in a permissible way without closely examining how the process works in practice, yet that is what the District Court and Fifth Circuit did here. The Court vacates the Fifth Circuits judgment. But fairness to the litigants and the courts that heard the case requires that it be remanded so that the admissions process can be considered and judged under a correct analysis. In determining whether summary judgment in the  Universitys favor was appropriate, the Fifth Circuit must assess whether the University has offered sufficient evidence to prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.""

Amy Howe: ""Justice Scalia's concurrence is very brief. He says because the petitioner did not ask the Court to overrule Grutter, he joins the opinion of the Court in full. The majority seems to reaffirm that diversity is a compelling interest if only because that rule was not challenged by the plaintiffs in the case.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-345_l5gm.pdf) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents alone. Kagan was recused. 

* Eugene Volokh asks the big question of the day: ""Given that the Court issued a rather plain vanilla 7-1 ruling remanding the case to the Fifth Circuit to apply strict scrutiny, why did it take nine months to issue the opinion?"" Some back and forth obviously occurred between the justices.""

* The NYT has their [analysis/blog](http://projects.nytimes.com/live-dashboard/2013-06-supreme-court-decisions?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;WT.z_sma=US_LAO_20130624) up on the decision.

* Ilya Somin has some analysis on the decision over at [the Volokh blog](http://www.volokh.com/2013/06/24/preliminary-thoughts-on-fisher-v-university-of-texas/).

**UTSW v. Nassar (Kennedy writes,  5-4)**

*Issue:* Whether the retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-3(a), and similarly worded statutes require a plaintiff to prove but-for causation (i.e., that an employer would not have taken an adverse employment action but for an improper motive), or instead require only proof that the employer had a mixed motive (i.e., that an improper motive was one of multiple reasons for the employment action).

*Opinion Summary*: The Court holds that Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of ""but for"" causation, not the lesser causation standards stated in the law. Kevin Russell: ""The question in Nassar was whether a provision of Title VII that permits a plaintiff to win by showing that discrimination was a ""motivating factor"" in an employment decision, also applies to claims of retaliation. The Court holds that it does not, so the plaintiff has to meet the higher burden of proving that the employer would not have taken the challenged action (say, termination) if the employee had not filed an EEOC complaint.""

[Opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-484_o759.pdf ) 

* Fifth Circuit is vacated and remanded. 

* Justice Ginsburg dissents joined by Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

* From Ginsburg's dissent: ""Indeed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers. Congress had no such goal in mind when it added the provision at issue in the case.""

-----

Pro-employer day at the Supreme Court, at least according to Ginsburg. 

* Kevin Russell: ""In both of her dissents, in Vance and Nassar, Justice Ginsburg calls on Congress to overturn the Court's decision.""

* Justice Ginsburg's bench statement says of Vance and Nassar that ""Both decisions dilute the strength of Title VII in ways Congress could not have intended...Today, the ball again lies in Congress' court to correct this Court's wayward interpretations of Title VII.""

"Federal bar admission: worth it?","2013-05-01",1367442471,"Federal bar admission: worth it?","So, I'm unemployed and job hunting, and just found out I passed the MA and NH bar exams. So, the next question is, should I apply to the federal districts in NH and MA? It seems pretty presumptuous, but I've already been involved in a few federal cases as a law clerk just on diversity.

Anyway, my current thought is that it's $450 or so that I could spend better at the moment. MA has an admission ceremony once a month, and NH has one twice a year, but will let you appear so long as you append a statement saying you've applied and are awaiting swearing-in (the sole difference is that you can't make a motion for pro hac vice admission of someone else). So in either case, I could pretty quickly be able to appear in a case/line of work that required it. An attorney I've been working with part-time suggested it as a resume booster (something along the lines of ""people will think you do big important federal-level work if you got this right away""), but it seems like that'd be fairly secondary to most employers.

So, thoughts? Worth the money, or should I buy myself a nicer suit for interviews instead?","law",11,"https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1di917/federal_bar_admission_worth_it/"

I was wondering if it's the technology use. We use a web portal to manage all of the registration. Would a mobile app in any way be beneficial?  I just can't think of how to reach these kids.
