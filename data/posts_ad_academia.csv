"Schizophrenia knocked me out, but now I want back in","2019-11-13",1573613783,"Schizophrenia knocked me out, but now I want back in","Hi guys.

Looking for either a reality check or some encouragement. Sorry if this is the wrong forum or whatever.

Bit of background: I graduated almost 10 years ago and left academia entirely due to a long standing delusion that god was speaking to me through my car radio. I was ""told"" that I should leave academia because if I succeeded then I would become sick and die. Instead, I landed a customer service job, pursing academic interests only as a hobby and trying my best to get through life. I had no idea through all this time that I was sick.

After an ""experiment"" landed me in the hospital, I was given the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. I got on medication and therapy and the difference is pronounced. I have been in treatment for almost a year with no resumption of symptoms. I have no delusions at the moment and-- most surprisingly-- I have my motivation for life back and my passion.

So... Im going to try to get into a graduate program like I always wanted to.

I know its probably unlikely I will get in anywhere considering my poor grades, my medical history, and my long gap, but I know I absolutely have to try. It makes me quite sad to think of a future wherein I cant study. I cant even *read other people's studies!*  It just sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

**My question is this:**

When explaining the reason for the gap in my resume, if I am honest about the reason why, what can I expect?

Is it worse to look like a insane person or a burn out?

Am I likely to face more or less discrimination in academia than I would elsewhere should my condition become public?

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:**

I guess I should also ask if anyone has any advice on how to proceed. I dont have letters of rec, minimal experience, and only a standard grade point average (3.2) from a university ranked around #200 in the country. I also have about 50K in student loans, which I can suffer, but I want to try to take out as few additional loans as possible. I am hoping to go into a STEM field adjacent to my undergrad (Bio) in physical chemistry. I currently work doing development managment for a chemical manufacturer.

So, if anyone has advice on that it is welcome, though not necessary. If I can establish how up front I should be with an admissions officer or potential supervisor at the schools I am interested in, I imagine they can give me more concrete answers about application specifics.","academia",16,"https://www.reddit.com/r/academia/comments/dvlb17/schizophrenia_knocked_me_out_but_now_i_want_back/"
"Asians, the New Jews of Academia","2019-11-30",1575153767,"Asians, the New Jews of Academia","The Anti-Defamation League filed an *amicus curiae* brief defending racial preferences at the University of Texas ahead of a Supreme Court decision. In so doing, the nations most prominent Jewish civil liberties group has shamefully betrayed its longstanding commitment to equal treatment for all. It has also ignored the very long tradition of discrimination in academia against the new Jews, Asian-Americans.

Meanwhile, the brief against the university filed by four groupsamong them three Asian-American advocacy organizationscites the history of Jewish exclusion at the nations top schools in an appeal to end current race-based admission practices. Every facet of the discrimination that Asian-Americans face today in college admissions has been reflected in the Jewish experience, says Israeli-born Alan Gura, the briefs author. Kenneth Marcus, president of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, which signed onto the brief, agrees. It wasnt right for the elite colleges to limit Jewish students then, its still not right to limit Asian-American students now.
