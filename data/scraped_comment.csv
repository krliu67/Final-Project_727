MIT's holistic application process is the almost the same as the Ivies, and results in similar URM proportions as the Ivies. 

It's particularly interesting to compare with Harvard since they're both in Cambridge and are world renowned institutions. They have very similar URM proportions, but MIT's class of 2019 is 32% asian, vs. Harvard's 21%.

MIT's process is slightly different though:

1. No legacy preference

2. Less athletic recruiting culture

and then there's the makeup of the school:

3. 99%+ STEM, vs Harvard is 50% STEM

Just an interesting quirk I've noticed, that MIT has managed to go under the radar as far as the suing and complaints go, hehe.

I also hate the constant use of Caltech, as in the article. Caltech is a very special school for a very specific type of student. Although it has improved its male/female gender imbalance and URM representation, the former is still 2:1 male to female in their at-a-glance and 15% combined for all URMs.

I know star STEM students from MIT/Yale/Harvard who felt Caltech was too intense for them.","1"

1) Senior level leadership can be recruited from the Ivies and other elite schools (Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, Northwestern, Notre Dame, Duke, Vanderbilt). Many politicians come from the Ivies. Whereas schools like Caltech and MIT probably produce very select academics who may not have the same impact factor. Influential people and their networks are disproportionately represented by these elite schools. 

2) I've also noticed that very STEM based schools like Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Caltech, GaTech, Virginia Tech seem to - at least in my anecdotal experience - probably very good Asian representation, conversely their URM (Latino/Black) representation seems quite low. I did some of my training at Caltech.  ","1_1"

That MIT is 99%+ STEM, vs Harvard is 50% STEM has been and still is a significant factor behind the reduced asian proportions. I don't think anyone can really doubt that we disproportionately pursue STEM, and the issue becomes the fact that department sizes at schools are limited!

I think legacy admissions removal is probably the best start; these schools are becoming less and less the proper environments for the continuation such clubs.

Athletic recruiting is a tougher issue that asks what the role of athletics is at schools. I'm inclined to think it stays (but hopefully more AAs pursue athletics at a high level!)","1_1_1"

Yet, Asians are well below representation in fields like public policy or business (accountants yes, but C-levels are a very few handful). For example, only 2.5% of the House and 1% of the Senate is Asian, yet represent 6% of the total US population. In contrast, 9% of the Senate and 8.3% of the House but make up 13% of the population. Using similar arguments for Affirmative Action, elite schools should consider pushing asians in non-STEM fields such as Philosophy, Public Policy, Government, Business, etc.

Yes, which is why if you want to get on the z-list, you also have to make a substantial donation.  IIRC, Jared Kushner, a mediocre student (who isn't even a legacy student) got in due to a 2 million dollar donation from his father.  Harvard is corrupt to its core.

Ultimately, yes. But it's not as easy as simply ""commanding"" it. I mentioned Princeton earlier - last year they applied for an exemption from the DoE to keep from honoring an FOIA request for admissions files, DoE denied them, now they're engaged in a long lawsuit with the DoE.

Detecting racial discrimination using observational data is challenging because of the presence of unobservables that may be correlated with race. Using data made public in the SFFA v. Harvard case, we estimate discrimination in a setting where this concern is mitigated. Namely, we show that there is a substantial penalty against Asian Americans in admissions with limited scope for omitted variables to overturn the result. This is because (i) Asian Americans are substantially stronger than whites on the observables associated with admissions and (ii) the richness of the data yields a model that predicts admissions extremely well. Our preferred model shows that Asian Americans would be admitted at a rate 19% higher absent this penalty. Controlling for one of the primary channels through which Asian American applicants are discriminated against--the personal rating--cuts the Asian American penalty by less than half, still leaving a substantial penalty.","1"

While they compare white and Asian American applicants who are not ""recruited athletes, legacies, donor connections, and children of faculty and staff (ALDC)""

&gt; Importantly, more than 97% of Asian American applicants are not ALDC, meaning that our sample covers the overwhelming majority of Asian American applicants. However, we also show that our key findings regarding Asian American discrimination are robust to the inclusion of ALDCs. 

&gt; [More of the authors' thoughts on ALDC can be found the Discussion.] the elimination of either legacy or athlete preferences would increase the number of Asian American admits by more than 4%.

In addition, 
&gt; taking all the modeling choices of Harvards expert and simply removing the personal rating shows a significant admissions penalty against Asian Americans. [More details in Appendix E].

Finally, to address the common argument that Asian Americans are weaker in non-academic categories:

&gt; We construct a non-academic index by removing those characteristics that are explicitly academic in nature (e.g., test scores, grades, academic ratings) from the admissions index. Results are shown in the third and fourth columns of Table 8. In each of the top 4 deciles there is a larger share of Asian American applicants relative to white applicants. It is clear that, on non-academic measures, Asian American applicants are at least as strong as white applicants.

The authors also address first-generation status and geography.

---
&gt; It remains an open question how the loss of these admissions opportunities impacts Asian Americans. Based on their strong applications, it seems likely that Asian American applicants denied admissions to Harvard as a result of race will attend an alternative selective college. Of course, this does not necessarily mean that the costs are inconsequential as the monetary and non-monetary value of attending Harvard might be quite high. For example, the recent college admissions scandal suggests some families have intense preferences for attending an elite college (Chappell and Kennedy, 2019). More importantly, individuals will always have an opportunity to attend a different school, apply for a different job, or live in different neighborhood when racial bias shrinks the choice set. Yet, the availability of alternatives cannot justify discriminatory behavior.","1"

This is crazy. Even if the absolute effect (0.58%) is small, the relative effect (58%) is *huge*. And when we are thinking about discrimination, it is more appropriate to understand it in relative terms than absolute terms - preference between two people for admission as opposed to the overall effect of that preference on rates of admission.","1_1"

&gt; Asian American applicants are 4.49 percentage points more likely to be labeled disadvantaged by Harvard readers off a base of 6.36 percent.18 Those who are labeled disadvantaged are significantly more likely to be admitted, and this alone removes the difference in admission rates between white and Asian American applicants: for those who are disadvantaged, the admit rate for whites (Asian Americans) is 11.22% (10.33%); for those who are not, the admit rate for whites (Asian Americans) is 4.46% (4.49%).

The argument Harvard is making is predicated on Asian students having systematically worse personalities than any other ethnicity. There is a lot of acrobatics being employed to avoid saying that directly, but that's the crux of the argument. 

&gt;In its admissions process, Harvard scores applicants in five categories  academic, extracurricular, athletic, personal and overall. They are ranked from 1 to 6, with 1 being the best.

&gt;Whites get higher personal ratings than Asian-Americans, with 21.3 percent of white applicants getting a 1 or 2 compared to 17.6 percent of Asian-Americans, according to the plaintiffs analysis.

&gt;Alumni interviewers give Asian-Americans personal ratings comparable to those of whites. But the admissions office gives them the worst scores of any racial group, often without even meeting them, according to Professor Arcidiacono.

&gt;Harvard said that while admissions officers may not meet the applicants, they can judge their personal qualities based on factors like personal essays and letters of recommendation.

&gt;Harvard said it was implausible that Harvards 40-member admissions committee, some of whom were Asian-Americans, would conclude that Asian-American applicants were less personable than other races.

&gt;source: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html

No one is disputing that Asian-Americans are given worse personality ratings to a degree that it is visible in statistics. But Harvard's response is simply ""well, it must be right then, we're incapable of bias because our admissions committee has at least some Asian-Americans.""

It's hard to imagine how anyone who is familiar with statistics or U.S. history can accept the idea that an admissions committee is biased against a group is a priori implausible just because it contains some members of that group. Would they likewise judge [the idea that black girls see girls like themselves as uglier and lower than white girls a priori implausible](http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test)? I can't see them making this argument with a straight face, and yet it is essentially a parallel. Being a minority is not an inoculant against harboring negative attitudes towards one's own race, as I suspect everyone in this subreddit knows from personal experience. And what percentage of the admissions committee is Asian American? I don't see an easy way to find this information, but I would be very surprised if it is even 20%. Even if you could assume that this minority was complete neutral and unbiased, obviously a minority like this does not prevent the other 80%+ from harboring those attitudes. Since I can't find information about the racial breakdown here, I won't comment more on this point, but Harvard's argument is absurd.

So I hope Harvard loses, because as far as I see it, their argument is transparently racist. A few examples of Asian students getting in despite below average SAT scores does not disprove the rule. But at the same time, I don't hope that their opponent wins, because I don't believe that that Edward Blum or his interest group actually have the interests of minorities at heart. The point of the lawsuit is to defeat policies that provide a way in for minorities (even if those policies are deeply flawed), and the result will ultimately be that more well-off white students are let in. If Asians are helped, it will be as a side effect. I feel like the situation is ""if it wins, we're fucked, if it loses, we're also fucked."" And I think until Asian American communities become more politically active themselves, every case will be the same. ","1"

The way Harvard and other schools are approaching it right now is clearly flawed, but I would struggle to create a definition or a way of testing for it that is entirely fair or ungameable.","1_4_1"

You were the one who said the case would just let in more ""well-off"" white kids. The ones that are there lean heavily liberal, because they are invested in the status quo. Ivy League is notoriously liberal. So maybe not ""well-off"" but what some call ""one percenters."" But that was your term.  They're liberal.

This is the article that opened my eyes:
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/

You can also look at Daniel Golden's *The Price of Admission*. It is also a fact that many places have tried or modelled out economic affirmative action as opposed to race-based affirmative action. The reason you never hear about this, when it would seem to be a very liberal idea, is that in every case they have tried it you just end up with more Asians and working-class whites.

Merit is actually already pretty well defined. And I'm not someone who thinks they should just take the top SAT scores like the Gaokao. I think standardized tests should be used to set a lower cut-off for applicants, and then the class should be selected from that pool based on the other criteria. What's going on now is schools like Harvard using every subjective criteria they can find to artificially cap Asian enrollment, essentially applying the criteria they've chosen unequally. I think schools should be legally liable for showing they use one system for reviewing applicants, and that the criteria they choose is in some way quantifiable and applied in the same way for everyone.

This in particular I agree with. I think part of why there is so much emphasis on academics and on STEM subjects in Asian students is that there are just not that many other options, especially for people who are not US citizens.

&gt;Using administrative data from the University of California at San Diego, the author explicitly identifies and studies students admitted under affirmative action programs.

The difference in graduation rates is larger, with 57% of affirmative action students graduating compared to 73% of their nonaffirmative action peers. When compared to students just above the regular admissions cutoff, the differences are smaller-the difference in graduation rates is only 8 percentage points, and the difference in GPAs is only 0.20 points.

&gt; And yeah we ""preach"" that it'll hurt other minorities because that's literally what it will do. This is the exact same strategy the white man has always used against minorities and for some reason the most educated and well off in American society still can't seem to get that.

The difference between me and you, from what I can garner, is that you don't have a problem with Asians taking a hit if other minorities benefit (even if that means rich African Americans and Hispanics can take advantage of Affirmative Action while poor Asians get penalized with personality BS). Have some self respect.

And she gives presumptive guilt to land owners if they don't make such consultation under the reasoning that if a process exists, no matter how burdensome or opaque, then the land owner should known about it and go through it.  

Those aren't simple judicial disagreements.  Her arguments really are problematic on multiple levels and are flatly unintelligent.","3_1"

The solicitor for the EPA said this was possible and would be at no cost to the owner.

Her statement of what an owner should do is more a general statement that if you are making an investment in land it is assumed you would take the effort to verify the land you are purchasing. 

The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland. Chantell and Michael Sacket had recieved local permits, and started to build on it. That was back in 2007 which they were notified to stop building and contact the Army Corps of Engineers to obtain the necessary permits. They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

In 2012 the supreme court overturned that verdict. Back to the US District court, which they lost. It was determined they did fill the land without the appropriate permits. 

We are back in court to settle the standing of the Administrative Procedure Act, APA, which determine the scope and responsibility of a federal agencies actions. In 2006 another court case amended the precedence for how to apply the APA. Using that case as a foundation Sackets brought the case up again. And here we are.

A simplification of the history to now.

The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity. How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland? That is what the APA covers. Who and to what level are federal agencies required to notify the larger public. Would it be sufficient to offer a process to verify? That is the point she is making. Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify. Sackets are holding the side that it isn't them and really the local officials. Once they had the permit they were good to go. 

I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review. I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit. That stars with going to a community that has land available to use as you see fit. 

The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area. 

I am not a fan of someone building adjacent to where I hunt or fish. It can not be a free for all. They are from Spokane and found a beautiful lake.

It should never be assumed a land owner will participate in or even be aware of an opaque or overly burdensome process, which this is.  We are not going to go down the road of demanding everyone in the country call the army to find out if they can build their home.

&gt;The specific case is if the property is a wetland and was rightly classified as a wetland.

That's your opinion, and I vehemently disagree with it.  Even if that were the core issue of the case, you seem to presume that simply because someone says it is a wetland that it must be a wetland.  It is not.

&gt;They sued and were told they didn't have standing to review.

That in and of itself is rather ludicrous since they are the damaged party.  And that's a big part of what I was referencing earlier, the fact that Jackson and judges like her argue that the EPA's judgment is beyond reproach or appeal.  It's a ludicrous argument, and that judgment was rightly overturned.

&gt;The point about the previous owner knowing the classification as being under the Clean Water Act, CWA, as a wetlands is interesting. This would open up the question if the original local permit was valid in any capacity.

This touches on the core of my analysis of Jackson's arguments.  If the local permitting doesn't matter whatsoever and is made void by even an arbitrary or erroneous decisions from a federal bureaucracy, then the power of states and local governments to zone and construct is utterly null and void.  That is the start of a serious separation of powers debate.

&gt;How did they receive that permit without information on being a wetland?

That is a very good question, and I think it speaks well of you that would ask it.  What I find problematic is that Jackson did **not** ask it and is blithely unconcerned by it.  She presumes the landowner's guilt with a dismissive ""shoulda known"" argument that ignores the fact that lawful governmental authority permitted the construction.  

&gt;Both the Sackets and the local officials had adequate opportunity to verify.

You are now making the same egregious argument Jackon makes.  The landowner contacted the government.  The government said it was okay to build and issued a permit.  There is no reasonable expectation that homeowner would know otherwise when the lawful governing authority certified the construction.  If there is a fault to be laid on anyone in that case, it is to be laid on the local government, not the landowner. 

&gt;I have wasted way to much time on this. This is not a significant case to highlight the differences between the left and right of judicial review.

Nobody said it was.  What it being said, to put it in crude prose, is that Jackson showed her ass and brought her knowledge of law into serious question.  And she did.  She had several outbursts where she interrupted justices trying to ask their own questions of the litigants, and that is a serious breach of decorum in the high court.

&gt;I personally am very much a support of those that want to use their land as they see fit.

There we agree, and I also support the preservation of certain lands for environmental reasons.  But as you rightly pointed out, that's not really the issue brought up by this article.

&gt;The land in question is in a subdivision adjacent to Priest Lake in Idaho. The Sacketts own a construction and excavation company (Sackett Excavating). They knew in advance that their property was a wetlands. It is a common selling point of the area.

Colloquial use of the term is not the same as the legal or technical use of the term.  Advertising language is not binding or indicative of legal liability unless it is an intentional lie meant to deceive consumers.  

&gt;with all of that what was flatly unintelligent about her questions?

As I said previously in another reply, there are multiple unintelligent aspects to her comments.

First is the presumption of guilt she hoists on the landowner when the landowner received a certification from the government to construct.  This is beyond being an unreasonable argument.  It is unintelligent.  To hold anyone legally accountable you would have to prove they intended to flaunt the law, and that is literally impossible if they can produce a permit showing that the government authorized their actions.  

Secondly, she made reference to the issue of standing in such a way that, if she is to be literally interpreted, says the federal bureaucracy is beyond reproach or appeal and that their judgments are final.  It allows for no checks and balances on federal power or abuses whatsoever, and we all know that is a faulty argument on its face.  How she could think otherwise is a mystery... unless she's just that unintelligent.

Thirdly, she makes the argument that if any process exists, no matter how arbitrary or opaque, then the public is adequately serviced and the government is absolved of all responsibility or liability.  Again, there's more case law stating otherwise than one could possibly post on Reddit.  Just think about the implications of this for a moment.  If this were in fact the case, then how could Trump have ever been stopped from doing any of his administrative actions the way he was?  Take ending DACA, for example.  The courts have stated that there has to be a reasonable and clearly expressed process and ruleset for making decisions on such actions.  The government is not presumptively right in all of its judgments.  Jackson, though, seems to think otherwise, at least as far as the EPA is concerned.

The reason this case made it this far is precisely because of the multiple legal reasoning problems with it.  Multiple courts at this point have issued rulings that have serious and sometimes dubious legal problems.  That is not a problem necessarily with those courts.  It's a problem with the core legal reasonings behind the laws that establish and govern agencies like the EPA.  And now SCOTUS will hopefully clarify some of these issues.","3_1_1_1"

The litigants have in hand a permit issued by the local government.  At that point, whether or not it is a wetland is immaterial.  They literally went to the government and got approval to build.  It is not on the landowner to settle disagreements the government has with itself.

She made several assertions in her arguments that were factually wrong and even a couple that are legally dubious.

The crux of her argument was this.  If it was somehow possible for you to find out if a puddle in your yard was a wetland, no matter how hidden or convoluted that method may be, then the government should go after you with the full force of the law for not figuring it out.

I mean, this doesn't even make sense on the most basic level.  This is over land plots that are disconnected from wetlands, not waterways themselves.  We're not talking rivers, swamps, ponds, lakes, etc.  We're talking about a residential property on the other side of a highway from a waterway that has no water on it unless it rains and makes a puddle.  The EPA tried to claim it to be ""wetlands"" and prohibited any kind of construction on it.  And here Jackson is saying that the EPA shouldn't have its judgment questioned at all and that the property owner should go to jail for not assuming that a property within an unknown distance of water was potentially a wetland.

What it said is unclear, but the arguments in that case concluded moments later.

She made an absolutely unintelligible argument that is wholly inconsistent with the law and did so repeatedly never tweaking or even clarififying that argument. Instead, she just repeatedly interrupted the other justices to essentially say the EPA cannot be questioned and cannot be wrong in their judgment. 

Let me just lay out really quick why her argument is so puzzling and so horrendously ignorant.  Construction permits are handled locally, not federally.  But the EPA inserted itself into the process in some places by claiming lands that are not connected to wetlands at all fall under their jurisdiction and cannot be used for any construction purposes.  This specific case centers around a plot of land on the other side of a highway from a waterway.  It's not a wetland.  It has no water on it at all and is not in any way connected to a waterway.  It was zoned for residential use.

Now, Jackson says the property owner should have known or sought out a process to find out if the land was a wetland.  Again, there's no water on this land, and it is separated from waterways by a major highway.  There's no reasonable thought process for anyone to believe it would be a wetland.  But she says that since you can call... the army... that you are expected to call for **any** construction project anywhere and that if you don't you should be jailed.  

Now, this is unintelligent for multiple reasons.  First, it means that the federal government now holds the power of permitting over all land and that everyone everywhere has to consult... the military... to undergo construction projects.  That alone is a violation of the separation of powers between the state and federal governments.  Secondly, it means that there is a presumption of guilt on the part of land owners as there is no appeal process for the EPA's judgment, even in a case as ridiculous as this.  Jackson says no, if the EPA says it, you go to jail.  Thirdly, and most idiotic, is her argument that no matter how opaque a process may be, the fact that one exists at all in any form absolved the government of any fault whatsoever.  

These are just terrible legal arguments that a first year law student would see problems with and wouldn't dare attempt.  But she was so brazenly confident in these arguments that she thought it appropriate to talk over the other justices as they asked questions of the litigants.  She really caused a lot of head scratching with these little outbursts.  It seems in its face like an argument for total supremacy for all levels of federal bureaucracy.  That's not a smart case to make given the structure of our country.","8_1"

Because people love to have a metric that they can point to and optimize in order to show ""success"" regardless of how much of a bearing that metric has on ability. This is a huge problem across pretty much any organization of a certain size. When faced with a choice between ""accurate but difficult to actually quantify"" and ""has no real bearing on performance, but is a value that can be increased"" management will almost always go with the number and adjust their strategy to get it as large as possible in order to look good.","5_1_1_1"

They are a measurement of your ability to perform, that's why they exist. If you know the answers to a question that adds to your score. If you answer incorrectly it detracts from your score.

You could argue some people cheat or guess and that is scored the same as when people actually know the answer. But that does not explain why certain groups consistently perform according to their demographic.","5_1_1_1_1"

While I have extremely mixed emotions about quotas, that's a good point.

""Keep the Jews out of power"" is not comparable to ""help pull under served black communities into power."" The 1920's policies were *about* Jews. The modern day policies are *about* underrepresented minorities. There's a big difference between being the explicit target of discrimination and being the unintended ""collateral damage.""","7"

It doesn't matter if you had good intentions for something evil you are doing. Either way you are discriminating against people based on race. It is saying whites and asians are doing too well compared to others and it needs to change.

Think about what this is doing as well. It is only reinforcing the trends they are trying to correct. By penalizing certain groups you increase competition in that group and make them work harder to succeed. It perpetuates the factors that cause those groups to be over represented because they have to be better to do well. Their kids will then get better and better at it and this will increase the gap between groups. 

Meanwhile those who are being boosted despite performing more poorly will perpetuate the factors that caused them to be less successful because the underlying causes were never fixed and that weakness was proliferated artificially.

Then consider the fact that this is penalizing the POOR asians and whites and not the rich ones who already have ""privilege"" as progressives like to say. Since the best scores of asians and whites are still chosen over the lower scores, the more successful and privileged asians and whites will still succeed either way. But now the middle and lower members of these groups are penalized and are less likely to get in because the quotas force them out when they would otherwise be good enough.

In terms of the effects on white people, AA at places like Harvard actually helps them (most notably, white men.)

True but that is not the issue. We're talking about what is actually being done here, not what people want to do. The end result is the same and that is the issue. It doesn't matter if you think you are doing something good if you do something bad to achieve it.

&gt; And there are no underperforming people of color getting into Harvard. They're still among the highest performers.

I don't think you understand what the topic is. The whole idea is that black people for example are admitted into universities with lower test scores just because they are black. Meanwhile whites and asians have their scores weighted and penalized to get into the same college. A white person can get the same score as a black person and the black person will be admitted while the white person is rejected. So yes, underperforming people of color  are getting into harvard.

False. The bar for women is 30 to 50 points lower than men of the same race and whites are penalized similar to asians compared to other groups. Depending on stats for how high your scores are expected to be in your demographic you need to score higher to get in.

This is actually untrue. As I said, women outperform men in all subjects, are more likely to take advanced courses, graduate at a higher rate and make up around 70% of high school valedictorians. The only metric they differ on is the SAT, and the SAT is not regarded as highly as someone's actual grades, course load and extracurricular achievements. You're running on the assumption that a valedictorian with a full course load of AP classes, multiple extracurriculars and a well rounded application is being favored over the 3.0, standard placement male that made a 1530.","7_1_1_1_1"

AA is ultimately meant to *stop* institutions from selecting based on race rather than ability, but you have to start by changing the culture so that more non-whites have the opportunity to rise to positions of influence. 

If two students have perfect grades, or two job candidates have a perfect CV, oftentimes a selector will end up picking the candidate who looks most like them. It's not always conscious - it's just human nature. Apply that on a national scale though, in a country where most boardroom positions and college faculties are filled with white folk, and you have a problem that keeps feeding itself.

This all may be less true now, but back in the 70s and 80s was pretty much the rule, and you can thank initiatives like AA for gradually changing that. ","1_4_2_2_1_1_2"

The data supporting that the barriers are lower for minorities is well documented.  As well intended as I am sure it is, creating lower hurdles for minorities doesnt help them.  To get great you must compete head to head with the best.  

I think you are slightly confused.  Taking people that are less qualified into an institution or organization to achieve diversity does not benefit the community you are trying to help.   Ensuring that equally qualified candidates can get access does.

Why haven't they done it yet? And if they're recruiting and promoting solely based on merit, why are the majority of senior positions still largely occupied by whites?

Unless you want to argue that it's because whites have innately more ability (and obviously neither of us are doing that!) the conclusion is that it's because of ongoing, institutional racial bias. 

Initiatives like AA may not be perfect and I get that they can feel like reverse racism. Anything that explicitly uses race as a selection factor is always going to seem divisive, unfair and counter to the aim of achieving equality, but I think the alternative (*unexplicitly* using race as a selection factor) is worse.","1_4_2_2_1_1_2_1_1"

Businesses are making decisions, or should be making decisions, based on what is best for the customer, the shareholder, and the employees.  Ultimately the driver is long term profit.

Diversity for its own sake is rarely in line with those goals.  That is not absolute.  A business that is consumer facing and has a diverse customer base would be well serving its mission to ensure it provided staff that mirrored its customer demographics as customers tend to feel better understood within their cultural groups.

However in a business without this circumstance, diversity has of itself no impact to profit.   The business in that case should hire the best qualified candidates it can find.   Regardless of race, gender, creed, etc.   As a business owner myself, with a highly diverse staff, I can promise you choosing on diversity for my 150 employees has never been tied to anything but if that person was the best person for the job.   Any example presented to the EEOC where a candidate was equally qualified but not chosen, would be investigated aggressively. 

Schools on the other hand, have a slightly different scope, their output is the quality of educated people they put out into the world.  We choose the educational institution based on how it prepares people for their next stage in life and what contributions it makes to academic study.   So the school should choose the people best suited to do that.   Regardless of race, gender, creed, etc.   Now, colleges have this intangible, this college experience thing, they are curating to a sense. So they look at things unrelated directly to academics.  Thats cool, makes sense, but making race part of that choice affirmatively, is no better than making race a restriction, particularly when we see students who dont meet the same qualifications added in.   Choices like this can build animus, because someone running in a competitive environment can see that they are on a team that was built not to top grade talent, but to meet a diversity goal.   There are absolutely minority students that can compete and those students should be chosen based on qualifying based on the same standards.  All we do by letting in less qualified students who happen to be a certain race is perpetuate an idea that these students cant compete head to head.   That does them and the institution a great disservice. 

Again you are making a fair argument for equal access, equal protection, but not affirmative action.   The base reasoning of why, is because when that selection criteria allows lesser qualified students or employees to enter the pool it actually hurts them, it hurts the systems they are entering.   They can and do compete head to head, and over time they will expand, just as asians and indian kids have.   Those families often came here with little, didnt have a great grasp of english, and now they are dominating.  Jewish families, same thing.  Cuban families, same thing.   We are seeing Nigerian families get that same upward mobility.   This winning head to head is the right path forward, the right way to right the wrongs, and to tie this off, as a proud father of a latina daughter who works her ass off to compete head to head with the best students in the state, i dont (and she doesnt) want to be evaluated on a different standard, that is offensive and racist to her.  she is good enough to win, without someone trying to give her an advantage based on the color of her skin.","1_4_2_2_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Clearly Asian and Indian people that came to America for a better life started with a disadvantage, and in 2 generations they are dominating academically.  Now the system was stacking against them, making their bar higher.   

Set a standard, let people compete against that equal standard.
This inverse of Jim Crow (together but not equal) is not healing, its providing a crutch when one isnt needed.

If you want to make the argument that economics impact a students ability to build out a well rounded story, and that these students should be given some special consideration, that's reasonable, but race, while it intersects, shouldnt be used as an analog for that selection variance.

This is again a really complex issue. You never want to treat any individual as part of a monolith, nor is it okay to view ""Asian"" as a singular entity when there are so many layers of discrimination within our own group. I also agree that you cannot ignore classism in the discussion of discrimination.

Where you and I may depart a bit, though, is with the idea that racism ""is a result of"" classism. That is far, far, far, far, far oversimplifying things imo, and to be honest, I think it is misguided. Even Kang doesn't go so far as to reduce racism to simply being a function of class. Centuries of differentially applied racial mistreatment across different races means that different racial groups are by and large situated into different classes, even today. 

I do agree with you that certain Asian groups (Southeast, etc) tend to be far less systemically privileged than others (most notably East Asian groups). However, members of lower-income Asian groups are still better off in a lot of senses than members of lower-income Black groups. For instance, the number of gun deaths between poor Black neighborhoods and poor Asian neighborhoods just are not comparable. Same with reported instances of police brutality. (I'm trying to find the article that I had recently read with the data to back up what I'm saying. I'll link it when I do, but until then, feel free to take these unsourced claims with a grain of salt.) 

There is also the whole quagmire of implicit bias that comes into play. I know there is strong data showing that our society has been taught through decades/centuries of messaging to fear a Black face over a white face, and although I don't know if there's any data comparing lower-income Black and lower-income Asian faces, I think it's worth asking yourself, in good-faith honesty, some revealing questions. For instance, is the average white family more likely to cross the street at night if they see an African American man coming towards them, or if they see, for instance, a Cambodian immigrant man coming towards them? Assume both are from low-income neighborhoods, and both are wearing clothes that are typical to their respective communities. Which man has the media taught us to fear? To me, the African American man is far more feared than the Cambodian immigrant man. I am obviously only speaking for myself, but I don't think many people would disagree with me.

In terms of your Kang reference, I'm assuming you mean his most recent New Yorker article? I actually take issue with some of the things he says, most notably his use of the Japanese Internment Camps to highlight discrimination against Asians not receiving the same spotlight as discrimination against Blacks. Except with the Japanese Internment Camps, surviving victims received a formal apology and financial reparations within a few decades. The African American community had to wait centuries, until 2008, to finally get their formal apology for slavery and Jim Crow, and to this day has yet to see any form of financial reparation. That is quite emblematic of the difference between anti-Asian discrimination and anti-Black discrimination. 

That said, Kang did not make any argument that I could find on racism being the result of classism. I know he does not buy into the idea that Asians should minimize our own discrimination in contrast to the suffering of other groups, but he also acknowledges that Black Americans have it worse. In an interview about his book, when he's questioned about contrasting Asian American and Black American suffering, he says, ""You can also come in with all the caveats about how (Asian Americans) dont have it as bad. **That is true.** But if that is the only thing that you do, which is to negate a shared struggle, then you are distancing yourself from the struggle completely.""

So while I agree with you that a hierarchy exists within the Asian label, and that some Asian groups are more systemically disadvantaged than others, I don't agree that viewing racism through a purely classist lens is rightnor could I find any evidence that Kang would agree with you.","2_4_1_1_1_1"

Yes, I think were on the same page. From how your article puts it, take the institutional factor and extend it over generations and you have a systemic issue. The perceptions of Asians in relation to class is a very racist one, especially with how diverse the diaspora is.

&gt;Where you and I may depart a bit, though, is with the idea that racism ""is a result of"" classism. That is far, far, far, far, far oversimplifying things imo, and to be honest, I think it is misguided. 

Read The Perils of Race Reductionism by Adolph Reed Jr. Hes a Black Marxist professor and his views on race are close to mine. 

&gt;Centuries of differentially applied racial mistreatment across different races means that different racial groups are by and large situated into different classes, even today.

I mean look up the untaught history of Asian slavery and lynchings in the US, or the different racist laws (like how Asians couldnt own land until long after Black Americans could) aimed toward Asians and tell me theres no systemic effects on attitudes and treatment of Asians.

The complicated part is that there are Asians who came here in the 1800s and there are those who immigrated here closer to our era. Similarly there are African immigrants who are not ADOS and dont face the same systemic issues Black Americans face, and you see this in their education and economic outcomes. All this is to say, you can be of the same race and have very different circumstances and history.

&gt; For instance, the number of gun deaths between poor Black neighborhoods and poor Asian neighborhoods just are not comparable. Same with reported instances of police brutality. 

With all due respect I think this perspective comes from ignorance. Because poor Asians live in poor Black neighborhoods. I did. My mom was a victim of gun violence and police brutality (two separate instances) when I was growing up.

I think wealthier Asians are making leaps of interpretations about the blanket Asian experience from their own vantage point. But I challenge you to look into more stories from the other side.

&gt;Assume both are from low-income neighborhoods, and both are wearing clothes that are typical to their respective communities. Which man has the media taught us to fear? To me, the African American man is far more feared than the Cambodian immigrant man. 

This is from a white-centric lens tbh, and those who assimilated more to those narratives would feel this way, yes. For me what people wear is more telling than their face.

&gt; lIn terms of your Kang reference, I'm assuming you mean his most recent New Yorker article?

I meant his NYT one about AA.
 
&gt;Except with the Japanese Internment Camps, surviving victims received a formal apology and financial reparations within a few decades. The African American community had to wait centuries, until 2008, to finally get their formal apology for slavery and Jim Crow, and to this day has yet to see any form of financial reparation. That is quite emblematic of the difference between anti-Asian discrimination and anti-Black discrimination.

This is unfair. And the reason I think they did that was because they had more money to lose with Japanese business. I think where you and I differ is you think theres an inherent face value bias against races, whereas I think its very linked to the economic context.

&gt;nor could I find any evidence that Kang would agree with you

Check out his article Its Time for an Honest Conversation About Affirmative Action for class commentary about AA. For overall ideas about race being a function of class, definitely read Adolph Reeds interview I mentioned earlier.","2_4_1_1_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14oue7y/affirmative_action_divided_asian_americans_and/","Barblarblarw","2023-07-07",1688771137,1,1,0,0,"Okay, so Kang's article about AA is spot on. AA in and of itself is (was) the absolute bare-minimum move in the right direction; it was never the solution. Maybe I was overly simplistic in my initial reply to you, but I completely agree that AA is nowhere near good enough or comprehensive enough or nuanced enough to bring about any semblance of real equity. The cosmetic diversity it creates is merely a *small turn* towards the right direction (and even sometimes with harmful consequences, such as when school boards mandate ""representation"" in books taught by teachers with no real knowledge ofor authority to teachthe issues experienced by the students that those books represent).

Anyways, I don't know if you and I are talking past each other on AA, because if your stance on AA is the same as Kang's in that article, then we're actually on the same page.

By the way, if you're interested in more in-depth examination of the breakdown of Black America, check out the book *Caste* by Isabella Wilkerson. I don't expect that you'd read it just for the scope of this discussion, but it is definitely worth reading if you want to explore more about the intersection between class and race within Black America. She even delves into the differences between the African immigrant experience and the African American experience, like Kang (and you) touched on.

Anyways, it doesn't see like we disagree about AA. I just disagree with your assertion that racism ""is the result of"" classismas if prior to classism, racism didn't exist. You don't have to look any further than how this country was colonized before you see how racism far predates any class structure. If you want a more modern example, there's the Tulsa Race Massacre, where wealthy a Black community was razed because of racism. Their social class did not save them. There are so, so, so many more examples of racism where class does not come into play.

(By the way, when you say that the reparations for the survivors of Japanese interment was more for economic loss, you need to take into consideration the economic loss that was never compensated in the destruction of Black Wall Street. And when you lament that the oppressions against Asian Americans are untaught, remember, too, that the Tulsa Race Massacre is also untaught. Redlining is also untaught. There are a *lot* of atrocities committed against many populations that remain untaught.)

&gt;tell me theres no systemic effects on attitudes and treatment of Asians

I wouldn't tell you that. I never claimed that Asians were/are not subject to systemic racism, or that we don't also suffer from the effects of systemic mistreatment. Yes, of course Asianseven those from countries that are traditionally thought of as ""wealthy""have been subjected to oppression. That is not in dispute whatsoever.

Where I'm pushing back is the idea that the Asian American population has ""had it as bad"" as the Black American population. Even in books that detail the extensive history of systemic racism against Asians, like Erika Lee's *The Making of Asian America,* there are acknowledgements that in totality, our oppression should not take away from the far-worse oppression that Black Americans have endured, both throughout history or in current society. The ""coolies"" trade was quite possibly one of the most horrific instances of inhumanity that Asian people faced in American history, and yet neither the number of people who were coerced/kidnapped, nor the length of their oppression, nor even the intensity of their oppression can compare to the African slave trade. Generations of people were stripped of basic human rights in the African slave trade, while during the ""coolies"" era, indentured laborers were free to organize *literally hundreds* of protests, and it lasted a single generation.

Yes, Alien Land Laws barred Asians and not people of African descent from owning land. That was legally struck down by the end of WWIIroughly a century after the first wave of Asian immigration. People of African descent were not allowed to own land until 1866, roughly 2.5 centuries after the first slave ships arrived. Both are disgusting policies of oppression, but I don't agree with pointing to the Alien Land Laws to equivocate our suffering to that of African slaves and their descendants.

That's to make no mention of how redlining made Black land and homeownership a completely inequitable venture, or how the systemically driven ""phenomenon"" of Black land loss (a net loss of over $300 billion) in the past century undercuts the gains that the Black community had initially made in the early 1900s.

&gt;This is from a white-centric lens tbh, and those who assimilated more to those narratives would feel this way, yes. For me what people wear is more telling than their face.

It absolutely is a white-centric view, and I did that by design because this country's lens *is* a white-centric one. You're saying that for you, personally, people's clothing is more telling than what they look like. I absolutely believe you, but I also don't know how helpful your own individual perspective is when the discussion is about societal trends and tendencies. And again, our society is an unfortunately white-centric one, so I'm curious how you'd answer that question on a societal rather than a personal level.

Objectively speaking, there is a plethora of research demonstrating that the darker the skin tone a person has, the more there is an implicit bias against them. That has nothing to do with the color of their skin and everything to do with the messaging that we've all grown up withmessaging that has been controlled by white power and permeated into the perceptions of other non-Black races. There will absolutely to individual exceptions, sure, but I don't think those exceptions are pertinent to the discussion at hand.

&gt;With all due respect I think this perspective comes from ignorance. Because poor Asians live in poor Black neighborhoods. I did.

It may definitely be my ignorance. I live in Philadelphia, where there are lower-income Asian neighborhoods that are by and large South/Southeast Asian immigrant communities, so I was drawing from that example. But I won't pretend I'm not from a wealthy Asian family, meaning my perspective is a purely outsider one. If you're willing to share some resources with me that can help me expand my understanding, I'd be really gratefulbut no expectations to do it, as I know my growth is not your responsibility.

That said, what do you make of the fact that, in order to illustrate the danger and disadvantage of the community you grew up in, you had to reveal that it was a ""Black neighborhood""? That in doing so, you're highlighting how the highest-crime, lowest-income neighborhoods are Black ones, and while members of other races (including Asian and white) occasionally live in them, the residents are still overwhelmingly Black? To me, anti-Blackness is inextricable from the discussion on classism, and I feel your example actually supports that view.

&gt;My mom was a victim of gun violence and police brutality (two separate instances) when I was growing up.

I'm really sorry to hear about her, your, and your family's traumas. I hope that she's okayas okay as someone can be after experiencing that level of violence. Nobody deserves that.

I don't want to minimize your personal experience, so maybe it's best if I stop at just this: I think that a granular examination of individual experiences is very different from a sociological examination of trends. It seems like you're more speaking from the former, and I'm trying to speak to the latter. If you think that my observation is correct, we have a couple of options.

1. Stop, because we're not talking about the same thing.
2. If you'd like, maybe you can explain why your individual experience has been so integral to your perspective on society at large.

I'll leave the ball in your court.

Edit to add, this:

&gt;Read The Perils of Race Reductionism by Adolph Reed Jr. Hes a Black Marxist professor and his views on race are close to mine.

I did. He makes a lot of claims without really backing them up (not saying that he can't, but that he doesn't in the interview), so it's hard to have any sort of debate. I do question where he got his information on things like police treating lower-income white people the same in places where there are no Black and Brown populations, because police data in this country is notoriously hard to come by as police departments enjoy the luxury of  *voluntary* reporting. (Also, even if it's fully borne out by the data, isn't it telling that police only pick on poor whites when there aren't Black and Brown folks to bully? Because there absolutely are poor whites in cities with Black and Brown populations, yet they're not the target of police, according to Reed. How is that a divorce of race and class?)","2_4_1_1_1_1_1_1"

If you think that my observation is correct, we have a couple of options.

For the sake of brevity, yes, I think we agree on AAs limitation and that Black oppression is a significantly larger part of American history.

&gt; To me, anti-Blackness is inextricable from the discussion on classism, and I feel your example actually supports that view.

Im not trying to understate the existence of racism. 

That said, the thing Ive constantly heard from people when bringing up a history of anti-Asian racism, or when progressives omit Asians from the minority conversation, is that Black and Hispanic people have seen worse outcomes. That is, no matter how superficially hated you are (this is the realm of implicit bias) by society as say an Asian person, our outcomes as a whole have been kinder to us, and the proof is in that pudding.

Thats a class argument.

If lets say Black and Brown people trended as the countrys top earners, had high graduation rates, better access to nutrition and healthcare and subsequently longer life expectancy. Even if implicit bias toward them remained unchanged, our conversations about race would be vastly different. The socioeconomic outcomes are the measures of races significance in the present day.

What we all care about is haves and have-nots.

And this is where other factors like regionality come into play. I grew up in the South and I live in the West Coast now, and I can anecdotally promise you that all POCs have much less privilege in the South than other *wealthier* cities. Poorer areas are generally more racist, I wonder why?

In the collegiate admissions process this is something we can easily pinpoint via income, zip code, school district, etc. rather than making broad assumptions about race. If student Y shows that they faced more adversity and barriers to entry than student Z, I think theyre more in need of something like AA regardless of race.

&gt; Anyways, it doesn't see like we disagree about AA. I just disagree with your assertion that racism ""is the result of"" classismas if prior to classism, racism didn't exist

I think CRT  the actual CRT in colleges and not the conservative boogeyman  does a good job exploring how white was legally invented to demarcate who had access to capital and property in the US. 

Like how the Irish were not considered white at one point, or how even if you ask Black Americans and African American immigrants today, many will make a distinction between being Black and African American. (Also, see Dominicans and Cubans lol) This points to race as a legally-enforced class distinction beyond categorical genetics or superficial looks.

&gt; when the discussion is about societal trends

This is where I find critical theories around race most useful. But in the case of AA, when youre using trends to assess an individual, and that could easily fall into the realm of inadvertent racism where youre assuming behavioral traits of class via race.

For me, the goal is to do away with this made up and arbitrary European concept of race, instead of being reactionary to it forever.

I think my take is a bit more on the progressive class-conscious side and you take a more liberal stance on it. Heres a quote from Adolph Reed Jr. on this:

&gt; What can ultimately ensue is an ideal of society such that if 1% of the population controls 90% of the resources, as long as that 1% were apportioned in a way that more or less faithfully reflects the composition of different ascriptive groups within the population, then that society could be considered just. That is to say, if the 1% were [approximately] half women, 12% Black, 14% to 15% Hispanic, etcetera, it would be a just society, even though 90% of the people are getting the short end of the stick. That's the logic of a neoliberal notion of social justice.","2_4_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14oue7y/affirmative_action_divided_asian_americans_and/","Barblarblarw","2023-07-08",1688792028,1,1,0,0,"I think a crossed wire (could be my fault; I type faster than I think) is the idea that AA should be applied purely using trends. I want to clear up that that's not my belief. As I mentioned, I think what Harvard did was absolutely racist, and I think it is even more abhorrent that they would hide behind the guise of AA to justify their blatant discrimination. The way they wrote out their ""personality"" policies exposes their full bad faith in brandishing AA as both weapon and shield.

I also agree with the Reed quote on the dangers of overfocusing on the effects of racism (or, of course, race reductionism) without examining classism. My stance was never to claim that racism is the sole problem and that classism isn't central to the inequities in this country; my have said all along that my belief is that racism and classism are inextricable from one another. I even agree with him on the Tuskagee Airmen explanation being pretty thin on why Black Americans have lower vax rates, and that the real obstacle is most likely access. 

But why do Black Americans have more limited access to quality health care? Why are the poorest neighborhoods Black? Why is that a ""class argument""? How can race be ignored when race is the dependent variable?

&gt;Like how the Irish were not considered white at one point, or how even if you ask Black Americans and African American immigrants today, many will make a distinction between being Black and African American. (Also, see Dominicans and Cubans lol)

Seriously, check out *Caste.* 

&gt;For me, the goal is to do away with this made up and arbitrary European concept of race, instead of being reactionary to it forever.

That would be lovely. But do you think we're there? Forgive me, but despite stating that you're not trying to understate the existence of racism, a lot of what you've said suggests that you are positioning yourself as if we're already close to a ""post-racial"" society. That racism is the byproduct of classism, and that by targeting classism, we can make racism go away. That is divorced from reality, imo.

&gt;If lets say Black and Brown people trended as the countrys top earners, had high graduation rates, better access to nutrition and healthcare and subsequently longer life expectancy. Even if implicit bias toward them remained unchanged, our conversations about race would be vastly different. The socioeconomic outcomes are the measures of races significance in the present day.

But why is this such a fantastical proposition? Why is it that the idea of Black folks being the top earners is confined to a completely implausible hypothetical? I'm of the stance that it's largely because the long reach of historically racist policies, combined with an entire society marinating in centuries of the same anti-Black bias, have created the racialized class structure we see today, with Blackness being the anthithesis of ""white rise,"" the dropped anchor steadying everyone on the ship. Again, thoughts on Black Wall Street?

Ultimately, the idea that classism begets racism is one that I just cannot agree with or really even see merit in.","2_4_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

In fact, Stanford, which is also in California but is private and did practice Affirmative Action, had more White students than Latino by [8% of their student body](https://facts.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-profile/) and roughly the same number of Asians as Whites.

&gt; The ban first took effect with the incoming class of '98. Subsequently, diversity plummeted at UC's most competitive campuses. That year, enrollment among Black and Latino students at UCLA and UC Berkeley fell by 40%, according to a 2020 study by Bleemer. As a result of the ban, Bleemer found that Black and Latino students who might have gotten into those two top schools enrolled at less competitive campuses.


&gt; ""Black and Hispanic students saw substantially poorer long-run labor market prospects as a result of losing access to these very selective universities,"" Bleemer told NPR. ""But there was no commensurate gain in long-run outcomes for the white and Asian students who took their place.""


&gt; Black and Latino students were also less likely to earn graduate degrees or enter lucrative STEM fields. If you follow them into the labor market, for the subsequent 15 or 20 years, they're earning about 5% lower wages than they would have earned if they'd had access to more selective universities under affirmative action,"" Bleemer said.


&gt; The ban has in fact acted as a deterrent to prospective Black and Latino students, Bleemer said. His study found that high-performing minority students were subsequently discouraged from applying to schools where minority students were underrepresented.


&gt; It's taken 25 years of experimentation through race-neutral policies, for UC schools have begun to catch up to the racial diversity numbers lost in the wake of the affirmative action ban, says UCLA vice chancellor Chang.


&gt; Still, the California schools are unable to meet their diversity goals systemwide. Chang says his school is not where it wants to be. It still enrolls far fewer Black and Latino students than their share of California high school graduates  a problem it didn't have before the affirmative action ban.

Given that no UC school is allowed to practice Affirmative Action, I have high hopes that Latinos are going to do just fine nationwide post AA ban.  

Now when it comes to Black student admissions, there's a pretty big divide that you might be aware of, given your user name.  From my experience, there is a tremendous gap in culture between your average African immigrant family and your average Black American family.  As African immigrants continue to come over to the US, you'll see their share of Black students at elite colleges continue to grow.  I do believe that Black students' numbers at elite colleges may drop but overall black college numbers at say top 100 schools will likely stay the same.","7_4_1_1"

Thats such a fucked up stats for black students that year. Damnn. 


&gt; The California data shows that freshmen attending its nine public UC schools do not accurately reflect the states high school graduate population. In 2019, just a quarter of freshmen who attended UC schools identified as Latinx. By contrast, Latinx students accounted for more than half of high school graduates in California that year. During that same period, Black students accounted for just 4% of UC freshmen, even though they made up nearly 6% of high school graduates. The numbers were worse at the systems more selective institutions: at UC Berkeley, for example, Latinx students accounted for just 15% of freshmen, and Black students accounted for only 3%.

&gt; Since affirmative action was banned in the state, the UC system has spent more than $500m on outreach efforts to students from low-income backgrounds, students whose families had marginal, if any, college experience, and students who attend an educationally disadvantaged school. It has also adopted a holistic review process, which takes into account 13 factors beyond grades and test scores to determine admission. But the amicus brief notes: Although these programs have increased geographic diversity, they have not substantially increased the racial diversity of students admitted to UC. They have had little impact at the most selective campuses.

No.  Prioritizing students getting admitted based on race instead of merit will make winners and losers based on race.  

Here is an example in medical schools:

&gt; The middle set of bars in the top chart above show that for applicants to US medical schools between 2013-2016 with average GPAs (3.40 to 3.59) and average MCAT scores (27 to 29), black applicants were almost 4 times more likely to be accepted to US medical schools than Asians in that applicant pool (81.2% vs. 20.6%), and 2.8 times more likely than white applicants (81.2% vs. 29.0%). Likewise, Hispanic applicants to medical school during this period with average GPAs and MCAT scores were more than twice as likely as whites in that applicant pool to be admitted to medical school (59.5% vs. 29.0%), and nearly three times more likely than Asians (59.5% vs. 20.6%). Overall, black (81.2%) and Hispanic (59.5%) applicants with average GPAs and average MCAT scores were accepted to US medical schools between 2013 and 2016 at rates (81.2% and 59.5% respectively) much higher than the 30.6% average acceptance rate for all students (see bottom of highlighted dark blue column).

&gt; With a high school GPA of 3.20 and an SAT score of 1240, blacks and Hispanics had much higher chances of being admitted to the University of Michigan in 2005 (92% and 88%, respectively) than Asians and whites with those same academic credentials (10% and 14%, respectively).

Here is an example from Harvard:

&gt; By comparison, white admits earned an average score of 745 across all sections, Hispanic-American admits earned an average of 718, Native-American and Native-Hawaiian admits an average of 712, and African-American admits an average of 704.

Dont fall for it. There are ways to support the rights of both groups.

And conservative commentators have seized on the recent spate of anti-Asian attacks involving African Americans, some of them captured in viral social media videos, to downplay Trumps role.

""The recent crime wave against Asians in America's big cities is not the fault of Donald Trump, MAGA activists, conservative talk radio, or white people,"" right-wing Asian American commentator Michelle Malkin wrote recently. It's the fault of the perpetrators and the perpetrators alone  most of whom happen to be thugs 'of color.'""

But Asian American community leaders and experts say the hate directed at their community cannot be delinked from Trumps vitriol.

""When you have a former president who stoked the flames of white nationalism by using ethnic slurs to refer to the coronavirus, you're going to incite hate against a vulnerable minority, in this case, Chinese Americans, and by extension, Asian Americans,"" said Jennifer Lee, a sociology professor at Columbia University in New York.

Lee said that blaming African American men for the anti-Asian hate spree is misguided.

""The tropes of Black criminality and Black-Asian conflict made it all too convenient for viewers to reduce anti-Asian hate crimes to conflict between two minority groups,"" Lee said, referring to recent video footage that appears to show Black men attacking Asians.

And this doesn't even account for the biases of the people making determinations. We've seen too often where minorities are rejected in job applications because of this. Nor does it address the ""affirmative action"" known as legacy admissions.

In respect to the Asian Americans involved though. I am almost curious if they'd be at some advantage. Asian families do put a huge amount of pressure on their children to perform well academically which may be of benefit to them at least in that respect.

The relevant bit is where the commentators discuss Waxman.

They testified scores from guidance councilors and teachers were lower for Asian students.  I now see where your flawed data comes from, a preliminary study that removed a third of the applicants bc that made the data look worse for Harvard.  You data isn't ""from Harvard"" as you claim, it is likely from the asian students lawyers studies. We can't be sure since it is out of context and has no title, a big red flag.

While you go look for that non-existent data, lets make everything really simple. AA helps people get in who wouldn't have otherwise gotten in.

Affirmative Action has repeatedly been proven in court to be a form of racial discrimination. 

It absolutely is.

However, said racial discrimination has repeatedly been found to be in the best interest of the states, and is therefor permissible.

It passes a legal requirement known as ""strict scrutiny.""

[We know from centuries of research](https://equitablegrowth.org/race-and-the-lack-of-intergenerational-economic-mobility-in-the-united-states/) that the most important type of wealth is generational wealth, assets that can pass from one generation to another. Take a look at the actual demographic numbers of Asians immigrating into the US. They didnt start coming here in any significant numbers until the late 60s. This means that the average Asian American is a first or second generation descendent of middle class immigrants, not a fifth generation descendent of an indentured Chinese rail worker. Where as the average Black American is the descendent of a literal slave. 

There are exceptions by demographic, particularly war refugee populations. For instance the average Hmong American is the first generation descendent of a war refugee.

Affirmative action makes people uncomfortable because Asian-Americans were discriminated against by how affirmative action was implemented in reality.  Even liberals who support AA try to avoid addressing this issue directly. 

Let's be honest. If you have an Asian-American who grew up poor, first in his generation to graduate high school, and scores a 90, and an African-American who grew up middle-class with college educated parents, and scores a 80.

Its what happened when CA banned affirmative action. According to NPR:

Here's the upshot: A quarter-century after California banned race-based admissions at public universities, school officials say they haven't been able to meet their diversity and equity goals  despite more than a half billion dollars spent on outreach and alternative admissions standards.

In an amicus brief sent to the Supreme Court in support of Harvard and UNC's race-based admissions programs, University of California chancellors said that years of crafting alternative race-neutral policies have fallen short.

""Those programs have enabled UC to make significant gains in its system-wide diversity,"" the brief said. ""Yet despite its extensive efforts, UC struggles to enroll a student body that is sufficiently racially diverse to attain the educational benefits of diversity.""

The shortfall is especially apparent at the system's most selective schools, the university leaders said.

An affirmative action ban first caused a huge drop in diversity at top California universities","4_3_1_1_1_1_1"

I also think that the people who are (rightfully) criticizing the conservative Supreme Court for their biased decisions are losing credibility when they criticize the Supreme Court for this affirmative action decision. The plain text of the Civil Rights Act - specifically Title VI - explicitly bans affirmative action. It says:

Many Democrats who rightfully supported the Bostock decision, which said that LGBTQ discrimination was banned based on the plain text of the Civil Rights Act are now opposing this affirmative action decision even though the plain text of the Civil Rights Act would make affirmative action illegal.

Yes, but it's a little trickier than that, legally.  Title VI of the Civil Rights act prohibits recipients of Federal Financial Assistance from discriminating on the basis of race, color, creed, or national origin.  This includes every public university in the country.  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has [permitted public universities to use race as a factor when making admissions decisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger).

[Traditional Jewish Attitudes Toward Poles](http://www.glaukopis.pl/pdf/czytelnia/TraditionalJewishAttitudesTowardPoles_MarkPaul.pdf)
&gt;In Poland, ... there was little question: Jews were Jews. With some exception, Jews neither considered themselves nor were they regarded by others as Polish or Polish Jews. As is well known, Jews in Poland were allowed to have their own laws and institutions. They were a nation unto themselves and they maintained their nationhood in Poland. From the time of their arrival and through the centuries, they sought to protect their way of life. They were not merely a separate religion but a tightly-knit community, leading life largely separate from Poles. They had their own customs, culture, dress, schools, courts, community government, and language (in the 1930 census almost 80 percent declared Yiddish as their mother tongue). Menachem Begins father refused to learn Polish. In a word, the vast majority of Jews were unintegrated socially and culturally in the fabric of the larger society. They shared little or no national sentiment or common allegiance with the Poles. They and the Poles were almost strangers. They avoided association with the vast majority of the population, the Polish peasantry, not wanting to live like, or with, them.5

In an article entitled, Jews and Poles Lived Together for 800 Years But Were Not Integrated, published in the New York newspaper Forverts (September 17, 1944), Yiddish author and Nobel laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer wrote under the pen-name Icchok Warszawski:

&gt;Rarely did a Jew think it was necessary to learn Polish; rarely was a Jew interested in Polish history or Polish politics. ... Even in the last few years it was still a rare occurrence that a Jew would speak Polish well. Out of three million Jews living in Poland, two-and-a-half million were not able to write a simple letter in Polish and they spoke [Polish] very poorly. There are hundreds of thousands of Jews in Poland to whom Polish was as unfamiliar as Turkish. The undersigned was connected with Poland for generations, but his father did not know more than two words in Polish. And it never even occurred to him that there was something amiss in that.","7_4_1_3_1_1_1_1"

Polish Jews sided with the Soviets and participated in massacres of Polish peasants like the ones at [Koniuchy](http://www.glaukopis.pl/pdf/czytelnia/TheMassacreAtKoniuchy_MarkPaul.pdf).

As I have said before, Jews lived in Poland for 800 years without ever assimilating, learning the language, or integrating with the dominant culture in any meaningful way. They were a separate nation within a nation. Jews did not fight with the Polish nationalists against the invading Germans or against the invading Russians. They were active among the partisans and frequently participated in massacres of Polish peasants.

&gt; OLYMPIA - In a last-minute move, the Washington Legislature on Sunday night passed Initiative 1000, a measure that overturns the state&amp;#039;s 20-year-old, voter-approved ban on affirmative action.

&gt; I-1000 repeals Initiative 200, a measure approved by Washington voters 20 years ago that blocked the government from giving preferential treatment to, or discriminating against, people and groups on the basis of sex, ethnicity, color, race or national origin.

&gt; Under such a proposal, the Legislature could approve the measure with no changes, making it law, or not act, and let the measure go to voters on the fall ballot.

I really wish the author pressed on this case because that's not clear to me at all especially with a diversity rationale.  I see multiple issues with this claim:

* Plenty of countries have affirmative action programs that discriminate against political minorities with outsized economic influence. Malaysia, South Africa and I believe India as well.
* What's a minority in the first place.. from first principles. Could California and Texas have programs that discriminate against Asians (numerically a minority) in favor of Hispanics? (Majority of high school students)","3"

The truth is that Universities want 3 things: Money, Power and Prestige.  That is all.  They don't want to have the 'best' people or the smartest.  They want world-mastering bad motherfuckers who will bring them loads of Money, Power and Prestige.  This is why a large portion of Harvard's undergrads are international students i.e. children of kings and presidents.  And a large portion are 'legacy' admissions like Kushner whose family likely gave tens or hundreds of millions.
Or elite schools see something special in insane talents like Gates, Musk, Thiel, Brin, Zuckerberg.
Or the Black or Hispanic kid who is the smartest kid at his ghetto who WILL go on to be congressman or mayor in that district.  Look at all the Ivy grads amongst black and Hispanic members of congress.  Trust me, elite schools know exactly what the fuck they are doing admitting those students, and it is not playing nice. 
So take some suburban white or Asian kid with a 2350 SAT and a perfect GPA.  Sounds like he is gonna be a really good bank vice president or dentist some day.  Maybe he will give a cool half-million to his alma mater.  Harvard will pass on that, thank you very much.","1_1_2_2_1_1_1"

The logic that I'm seeing all over this thread is that black students automatically, due to their race, must have had an extreme disadvantage throughout their lives and they should be accepted over white/asian people with higher scores. While I am sure that there is a higher percentage of black people that *did* have to go through hardships and were more disadvantaged, grouping everyone into these categories is just not accurate and hurts people. There are poor white people in urban areas who also have struggled through disadvantageous situations, but this system does nothing to show for it. There *are* black people that are born into wealthy families and have had easier times than *some* white people. I'm not saying this is the majority of time, but it happens and this system hurts people.

I also went to and worked in admissions for an Ivy League university. I'm going to hop into this post yet again to try to explain:

Universities very purposefully craft what they want their incoming classes to look like. That's why you usually have to do more than just submit your high school transcript and SAT or ACT scores when you apply. The Admissions staff looks for a certain proportion (like...we literally grouped applicants into different verticals) of creatives vs. scientists vs. engineers vs. entrepreneurs vs. local applicants vs. community leaders etc. etc. etc. which reflects whatever goals they happen to have for the university that year.

We would weed out ALMOST every kid (I'll come back to this later) who clearly wouldn't be able to hack it in our classrooms, and then academic performance takes a backseat for really everyone. We instead look at personal essays to see what the kid's unique life experiences have been, look at extracurriculars, see what they're passionate about, where they're from, and all-around evaluate how they fit into what we want the student body to be that year. Race is just one of many factors that are weighed when comparing applicants with similar grades and test scores, with the understanding that simply being non-white does bring a unique perspective to the classroom (just like being poor might or being an immigrant might or being the son of a senator might or having raised money for cancer research that one time might or whatever). You obviously don't have to agree that Americans live meaningfully different experiences due to race, but that's the general concept. My lived experiences make me confident that we do, but I respect your right to have a totally different opinion based on your own experiences.

If you do not believe in systemic racism or that race impacts your lived experiences in this country, regardless of your net worth, then obviously race-based affirmative action would seem absolutely atrocious.  If you don't think there are race-specific problems in our society, then duh you don't see the need for any sort of attempt at a race-specific solution. However, if you do understand race as a meaningful and concretely impactful cultural influence in our society, weighing it when you're debating who can bring something different to the classroom than every other applicant with very similar application stats makes more sense.

Now, the unqualified kids who DID get TRUE preferential treatment in the process (guaranteed interviews, significantly lower scores and grades permitted, etc.) were legacy kids (children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of alums). Where is the outrage about that? Those kids are a pretty exclusively white demographic because of...you know...how history works.

I do agree that the current form of affirmative action fails poor people of ALL races. I'd like to see new legislation that reflects this reality. I have found this issue is due to universities being pretty risk averse. You see, the REAL priority of every Admissions staff is to pick the best possible group of students for maximum probability we all graduate, get great jobs, and start donating money. They ESPECIALLY care about matriculation rates and graduation rates (and keeping acceptance rates as low as possible), which determine how many students clamor to pay way too much money to attend our university. These stats do impact the endowment, and apparently everything in life is about money. That's why it drives me nuts when I see people imply blacks are just handed spots they do not deserve...it would make ZERO sense to accept kids who won't be able to keep up on campus. It's literally just bad for business.

Poor people are more likely to fail to actually show up when the semester starts, more likely to be unequipped to keep up, and more likely to drop out. So whenever a university CAN opt for the kid with a stronger resource pool that'll bolster their odds of graduating and donating, that's the kid they tend to lean towards, regardless of race. I also hate this.","8_1_1_1"

Back when my parents were going to school, it only took a few hours a day at the local Dairy Queen to make the tuition and some fun money. Now, that's impossible. 

I fully believe it is because of the greed of college administrators taking advantage of the climbing federally subsidized student loans. 

Essentially, it used to be where upper-class students didn't have to worry about paying for school because they were rich. Middle-class students could, fairly easily, pay for their own school and/or it wouldn't be a huge financial burden on parents to help or support their child through college. Lower-class students were incredibly rare because not only did they not have the money to pay for school, but their primary and secondary schools sucked, so they weren't getting an academic scholarship. 

So, Americans made a call to help lower-class students be able to go to school. They created a federally subsidized loan based off of net worth of the parents to ensure financial need. This loan program finally allowed many lower-class students to get an education and have a chance at class mobility, which is nearly non-existent in many areas without some sort of neutralizing factor. 

This is a great concept. Allow everyone to go to school, regardless of financial status, and hopefully, the American Dream becomes more than a fantasy. There was a problem, though.

University administrators responded to the loan program like any business would. They raised prices. Now, many schools were out of reach for lower-class students. This also put a larger burden on middle-class students as the hours they needed to work per week to pay off college without loans went up. Upper-class students just paid the price.

In response, the loan amounts went up. This created a cycle that leads us directly where we are today, with a little bit of help. What I mean by that is the loan amounts have been attacked in different ways, and sometimes, they don't keep up with the tuition increases. So we're now at a place where the lower-class students can't afford a lot of schools, middle-class students can't really afford any schools without a huge financial burden or using predatory, 3rd-party loans, and upper-class students are still partying through college because they get an allowance. 

This is compounded by a couple of evils. First, the FAFSA (the document you must fill out to get financial aid from the government) uses net worth as a determining factor of EFC (Expected Family Contribution). While this seems good theory, it's terrible in practice. It looks at small business owners and views their non-liquid assets as cash, even if the cash flow of the business is minuscule (which it often is, especially compared to hours worked). This means students who have parents that are small business owners are often expected to contribute 100% of funds to colleges, funds they don't have. I have personal experience with this in that my wife is the daughter of farmers/ranchers. They have a lot of assets on paper, but the margins are so thin that they can barely make ends meet. My wife got no financial aid from the government except the loans that start collecting interest right away. That loan amount was a few thousand over her college career. The majority of her school was paid through 3rd party loans. 

The second evil in all of this is the school-related expenses that aren't taken into consideration. Textbooks, mainly, but also room &amp; board, school supplies, fees, and many other hidden costs. Yeah, a ton of this is available through schools, but much of it comes at super inflated prices or requires a surrender of freedoms that are otherwise granted to legal adults of certain ages. Loan amounts can't keep up with the exorbitant rate of inflation in textbooks and the like.

The third is one of those fees. The student activities fee and probably the athletics fee. These fees go up and up every year and contribute very little, if anything, to the actual education of students. Universities are turning from educational centers of enlightenment to young adult daycares centered around sports teams. College athletics rarely pay for themselves, and while they do get a very small amount of people out of the lower-class and into a situation to give back, that money could more effectively be spent just getting students tuition paid. Universities are building ridiculous student centers filled with leisure activities. High-level concerts are partially funded by universities every single year. Ridiculous expenses are happening every day. Now, I'm not saying that there shouldn't be social events or events to help students blow off steam on campus, but there are cheaper, more efficient ways of doing so than [bringing in a rap artist to North Dakota](https://dakotastudent.com/4268/news/wiz-khalifa-to-perform-at-alerus-center/) who ended up being a major disappointment and actually ended the practice of concerts funded by the university every spring. These fees fund these programs that certainly do impact and benefit all students. Still, these fees essentially allow the upper-class, who could already pay for these things out of pocket, to be subsidized by the middle-class and lower-class students who really can't afford it but are forced into it through mandatory fees.

So, what do we do? Well, it's pretty clear that partially funding college education is a plan that just doesn't work with American greed having infected universities. So, we have two options, in all reality. Either A) we go back to what it was before. We drop all federally subsidized school assistance. This is extremely problematic. Not only would the lower-class student have no way of paying again, but middle-class students would be locked out still. In addition, hundreds and hundreds of schools across the nation would shutter, and starting new Universities is not an easy thing to do. After a period of time, it's reasonable to think that demand will increase supply with lower costs, so middle-class students may once-again have a realistic shot at debt-free college, but then we're right back to where we once were. The other option B) is that we fully pay for education costs. I personally think making this needs-based is a terrible idea as financial cutoff lines are always too slow to react to the current economy. The handful of students it would cut off probably wouldn't save much money. Of course, this option is just as problematic. It requires a *ton* of funding and fighting the elites who make the laws to get it done.

Ultimately, I don't think either of these solutions is the best. I think a cultural shift on how we view education would be more beneficial to the general public, as well as a complete redesign of our primary and secondary school systems. 

Frankly, I don't know what will happen. Post-secondary education is a bubble waiting to burst, and they all burst at some point. It's not going to be pretty. The middle-class and lower-class will likely feel most of the burn, but so will a small section of the upper-class. Regardless, it's going to eventually fuck up our entire nation and how we view a lot of things in our society, so really, we need to do something and fast. Doing nothing is not a realistic solution, although the solutions themselves don't appear to be too realistic. ","8_1_1_1_1_4_1_2"

State Universities are actually pretty expensive these days, although those graduates don't typically leave with the totally outrageous, six figure debt you hear about private and elite university grads carrying.  Community college is probably the closest thing we have.  

The community college system was started with the mission of providing very low cost education to basically anyone who showed up, and offer short two year degrees and the ability to transfer those credits to a full university, reducing the overall cost of a degree substantially.  They've gradually had to raise tuition and fees, shrink their offerings, and greatly tighten their loose academic standards to effectively kick tons of people out whenever their budgets get hit or their enrollment explodes.  When something like the financial crisis in 2008 happens, their budgets are demolished at the same time as their enrollment explodes with laid off workers, and the schools have really no choice but to completely retreat from their original mission.  

Then you have to consider the scam of expensive textbooks, although in my time at community college a decent number of the professors were cool enough to use older texts that were available for a few dollars on amazon.  

One big problem with going to our community college system is that you're not going to be offered reasonably sized subsidized loans to pay your living expenses, and your grants will be very low, so you will need to either live with family rent free, totally supported by them (not an option for most working class people), or work a lot of hours due to the fact that unskilled labor pays so poorly.  So these schools oftentimes end up trapping people in them for long periods of time, and their graduation and transfer rates are frankly awful.  ","8_1_1_1_1_4_1_7_1"

I wasn't able to finish because I didn't have the money or needed to eat and live rather than get my education.

But, I lucked out, and became successful.

During my freshman year I had some left over money (I was living at home) and decided to get a desktop computer instead of a used car (and instead got a bus pass to get to/from university and home).  Even when taking basic classes during college, I would come home and self-teach myself computer technology and programming.  I eventually dropped out of college because I needed to eat and have a roof over my head. But, because I was self-teaching myself computer technology I was able to get an entry-level job at my very first office job.

That lead me to my first IT job at the age of 20/21 with no degree.  This was in 1997/98, and the internet was just getting started.  I lied and said I knew HTML and SQL.  I went to the bookstore and purchased books and became an expert in HTML, MS Access, and MSSQL.  Each successive contract job lead to the next one, all while increasing my skillsets.

It's been 20 years later and I'm still doing contract IT jobs that make me $100-125/hr.  I've been lucky in that my experience outways my lack of any degrees.  I still wish to earn a college degree one of these days.  Maybe when I retire.  ","8_1_1_1_1_5"

It's less money and way more interesting than dealing with many of the dumbed-down general education classes universities make students take to get degrees.

They just can't imagine that literally 23% of Harvard students come from the richest 0.1% of families, whereas less than 20% come from the poorest 50% of families. Lots of people think that rich kids are only slightly over-represented at Harvard, and that the majority of students are from the bottom 75% of family income. The truth is that there are twice as many Harvard students whose families are in the top 25% of incomes than students whose families are in the bottom 75%. Legacy admissions may help top up the Harvard endowment, but there are far too many of them, and it's frankly disgusting that universities like Harvard have such a good public image when it comes to helping poor students. The prevalence of legacy admissions in Harvard should be repulsive to anyone who believes in academic standards, and it should really be hurting Harvard's image much more than it currently does.

As I've written elsewhere, I'm way happier discussing issues with affirmative action IF AND WHEN that discussion includes advocating for other legislation that we can agree might better resolve issues stemming from systemic racism. That's just too rarely my personal experience when I do try to talk about this kind of stuff.

And I am not Asian American and don't really feel qualified to deep dive into that perspective. However, generally speaking, I am definitely unsatisfied with the stats I see referenced. This may be problematic, but I will say that when I was in Admissions, I heard frustrations about a disproportionately large percentage of those applications having strong academic performances but virtually empty or indistinguishable extracurricular offerings. I really didn't have enough of a hands-on role in any of those decisions to speak definitively, but I believe the overarching concern was that - while test scores and grades are great - there just wasn't often as much there beyond the transcripts. With everyone, the right grades and test scores get you in the door, but that's really as far as it gets you. I don't know how much water this theory that Asian American applicants sometimes focus TOO exclusively on academics and not enough on ""standing out"" actually holds, but it's the type of comment I recall overhearing.

To be frank, I would personally see more value in doing something like outlawing legacy admissions or requiring need-blind admissions nationwide or really removing any other institutional privilege that benefits demographics I would argue do not need/deserve them to open more spots to everyone.

I'd like to copy/paste a previous explainer that might add some context for you to better understand the rationale from the other side:

""This is what I tried to flesh out in my comment, albeit maybe not very effectively. At least at the elite university level, ""merit"" is not determined by test scores and GPA alone, ever, even excluding considerations of race.
Frankly, everyone who we consider had the raw academic performance to impress us. They're all exceedingly intelligent (and hardworking). And we know that grades and test scores are not objective or universal metrics. So, like I've written elsewhere, a 2100 from a kid in the state's most underserved school is more impressive than a yet another 2400 from a kid from a fantastic school where ten other kids with the same GPA and test scores are applying to the same university. On the flip side, we were also aware that a 3.9 from a disaster public school may be different than a 3.5 from an elite boarding school.

So how do we make sure the ""most qualified"" person gets in? For what it's worth, the tiny handful of kids who were demonstrably geniuses (the literal kind)? Of course they get in. We'll take a future nobel prize winner every time. Beyond that, we evaluate the whole person, not just their transcript. That is why personal essays and extracurriculars and personal hardships (and yes, even race or country of origin) come into consideration - ""most qualified"" encompasses more than just ""best test and grade stats."" Having the best grades doesn't mean you're the smartest (I say that as a relatively average dude who happens to be a fantastic student), and it doesn't mean you automatically have more to contribute to the university than everyone else. We don't just want people with good study habits, we also really want to graduate future billionaires, presidents, CEO's, famous directors, scientists, etc. At least, that's the rationale. It was less ""who is the smartest"" and more ""who is the best at what they do, academic or otherwise (and also smart enough to thrive on this campus?)"" Again, you don't have to agree with it, but Admissions just IS a holistic process.

However, to be fair, if I saw all this energy against affirmative action paired with a widespread passion for removing every single consideration outside of grades and tests (no extracurriculars considered, no personal essays, no legacy student considerations, no names even, just standardized test scores), then I'd be more sympathetic to that viewpoint.""

Of course. The #1 group that benefits from affirmative action has always been white females regardless of income levels. What people often don't realize is that AA is not a catapult for people of poor academic backgrounds to use to land themselves in elite universities. As you've said it's terrible for business for schools to admit people they know cannot reasonably succeed based on their prior academic performance. Given this circumstance, middle to upper class white females have by and large escaped the many pitfalls of growing up poor or from a historically disadvantaged ethnic group since literally their male counterparts that have historically dominated elite university admissions are from the same households.

It's worked great for white women in the sense that the gender at universities imbalance has since disappeared, and now my understanding is that universities will now treat gender the way they treat choice of academics -- in other words they'll balance them out so they don't have too many members of one group over another, like striking a balance between creatives and engineers. 

It also demonstrates the failures of AA pretty starkly. While white women have largely overcome the previous admissions bias against them, even perhaps overstepping gender parity in terms of matriculation and graduation rates, the orinally intended recipients are woefully behind: only 5% of students at flagship universities are black.

Affirmative Action historically included gender as well as race. Years ago when women were encouraged to be homemakers or attend some sort of finishing school to train for pink collar work such as being a secretary, admissions for women at elite universities was not very high as many women did not apply. I think Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton have great anecdotes that describe the attitudes of men in academia in the 60s and 70s as they were attending law schools full of men. Hillary Clinton describes men attempting to guilt her to give up her seat in school since many white upper class men of the time stayed in school to avoid the Vietnam draft which wouldn't have been something a woman had to avoid. 

And so, AA included females as an effort to change the detrimental effects of upper class white male dominance in university admissions and attendence. The problem is, is that times have since changed and women are mostly out of their homes and working in careers requiring skill and education. The gender gap has rapidly decreased since the 1980s and in many modern statistics we see higher instances of females attending and graduating universities vs males. 

The third point in this is that white females attending elite universities are usually and literally  are from same families as their upper class white brothers who were the status quo for centuries. AA does not take that into account. A white female in the *same* household as a white male who has had an upper class upbringing will get more preference than her brother just for having a different anatomy due to historical times where females just weren't encouraged to pursue college due to war or traditional values at the time. This naturally will give well heeled white females more advantage than ethnic minorites. We also must take into account the number of applications of white females vs ethnic minorities and differences in population size. It's safe to say that there are probably many more white females numerically applying to ivy league institutions than some groups of ethnic minorities put together regardless of gender.

Looking at the Harvard stats 22.1% are foreign students that they don't break down by region so lets give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that those students are demographically identical to the rest of the world. This seems unlikely but we'll ignore it for now because we don't have enough information to make a good judgement.

After removing the international students the demographics of the American students only are:


Ethnicity| %
---|---
White| 55
Asian| 17
Native American | .39
Black | 6.5
Hispanic | 9.9
Other | 10

Other is a combination of the two or more races and race unknown from the Forbes source.

The only ethnicity that is over-represented are Asian Americans  (17% of American admissions to Harvard vs 4.8% of the US population). My guess would be that Harvard attempts to admit in line with the general population. Unfortunately they don't get enough qualified applicants to do this so then they fill in the rest of the class with the most qualified applicants who are predominantly Asian American.  

This falls in line with what this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/affirmative-action-battle-has-a-new-focus-asian-americans.html) says. That super qualified Asian Americans are turned down from prestigious Universities but slightly less qualified applicants of different ethnicities get accepted. It also matches what \u\kuh_leel said about how the current admissions system is failing poor people given that Asian Americans have the [highest average household income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_the_United_States_by_household_income) by over $10,000 dollars a year. 

EDIT - TLDR: Taking Harvard as an example it seems like they are probably trying to match the general population's ethnic demographics but don't get enough qualified applicants from many demographics. Also don't be poor if you can help it.","8_1_1_1_7_2_1_2_1_1"

No no one expects really anything that an 18 year old does in their first year at Uni to do something ""marvellous."" Does that mean their contribution is worthless, of course not.

A big part of Engineering education is teaching people how to think about the world in very precise and exact ways, ways that can seem very unnatural to someone who is untrained. One of the best ways to train people is by challenging their assumptions about a problem, and one of the best ways of doing that is by letting a peer challenge that assumption.

I have a question about college admissions in the US.

I read an article somewhere where it said that top level Ivy League schools had to be careful to keep their classes still filled with the children of the affluent to a degree, even if tuition fees weren't an issue. (say, if the government just payed everyone's tuition, hypothetically), because what gives them their true selling power, their real prestige, is that people can come there to mix with the 1%, to have their kids make friends with kids from the richest percent, network and maybe go into business or something.

That even if the parents of kids from lower income brackets want 'their' kids to get in, if all the kids like theirs did get in, and fewer (perhaps slightly less academically qualified) kids of the super rich were there, they wouldn't really want that, because it's really the connection to the super rich that people are vying for.

How much truth would you say there is to this?","8_1_1_1_9"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6r5z4s/as_trump_takes_aim_at_affirmative_action_lets/","[deleted]","2017-08-03",1501778945,15,15,0,0,"Really good question. So first and foremost, I want to be super clear - I worked in Admissions while I was a student there myself, so when it came to more contentious questions (like the one you just laid out), I was fed much of the same ""company line"" as anyone else would be. If this sort of thing is a policy of any kind, it's a ""don't ask, don't tell"" kind of thing, and definitely not ""official"" in any sense of the word.

However, based off of the things I heard, observed, and experienced, I would say I personally feel this is true to some degree. That's part of why I find people screaming bloody murder about race considerations to sometimes be so obtuse. There are SO many other things weighed in applications that have nothing to do with academic performance or ""merit"" which really only benefit rich, white people.

I had several experiences where I'd make a friend and down the line casually learn they were the 5th generation of their family to go to school there or their family funds a University fellowship or a building on campus is named after their grandparent.

First off, favoring these families has a pretty immediate financial benefit. Most, if not all, of the Ivy League rely on ""need-blind"" admissions, which means your application to the school and any applications for financial aid are considered entirely separately. So if the school already has a relationship with your family or can otherwise deduce from where you're from/who your parents are that you're rich enough to pay full tuition, then that's an accepted candidate they know will bring in money at least in the short-term (to be fair, this also makes it possible to accept more hyper-qualified poor students who will often have 100% of their financial need met, which is at least a silver lining).

Second, it does also feed into a sense of exclusivity which is what the Ivy League is basically about. Again, it often comes down to marketing. Admissions at the level that I'm familiar with are extremely cutthroat, both for the students to get in AND for the universities to enroll the students that they accepted and don't want to lose to a different school. So, the school wants to seem as elite and aspirational as possible, so there's no doubt you'd be ""lucky"" to attend. While letting in miracle kids who make it out of the hood against all odds since they are truly the best of the best plays a role in that, so too does making sure the sons and daughters the 1%, for example, are well represented on campus.","8_1_1_1_9_1"

It's due to donations.

If an Ivy league school flipped from say....10% asian to 60% asian or maybe rowdy middle class party types in the course of a few years....you better believe some of the wealthier, older alumni(ie: the wealthiest, mostly white) would donate less(""this isn't the school I went to! They replaced Mario's with a sushi place!"").

I didn't really dig college that much but my parents did and donate regularly decades after. I wouldn't donate a dime....I couldn't tell yell when homecoming is but my parents know like clockwork.  If the school turned into some hipster paradise and my dad's old black frat left, I'm sure my parents wouldn't donate a dime either.

Also, it was only after I graduated from college that I learned that you get money from doing well in your PCATs. Me, my peers, and our parents just didn't know how to navigate the system well in the first place.

There was a definite threshold in terms of academics, and once you were into that, it came down to academic interests (such as major), personal experiences, and background.

Part of that too is if they went by PURELY academics, 95% of the engineering majors would end up being Asian, which doesn't create a diverse atmosphere (we ended up being about 25-30% Asian overall after yield).

A highly qualified student with great test scores and grades is more likely to drop out of a program or university if that student is underrepresented in the program. 

As I responded above:
&gt;There's actually another reason to consider race (and gender) as well. There have been numerous studies on how well a person does if they are in an extreme minority in a college program. For example, imagine you have a group of physics majors taking an advanced physics class, and there is one black student in that class. Or imagine you have an advanced mathematics class with one woman in it. The stereotype threat those students feel are extreme.

&gt;There have been studies done that show a student in that situation doesn't feel comfortable asking questions in class or asking for help in general. Thus, they are more likely to struggle, and feel like they are letting their race/gender down. They're highly likely to drop out.

&gt;Basically, to help underrepresented groups succeed in universities, there needs to be a certain threshold of those groups in the classes. If you are a white man reading this, imagine how you might feel if you were the only man in a gender studies class or the only man in an African American history class. You might feel like everything you say is up for scrutiny, that people are judging you as racist or sexist. So, you might just choose to keep your mouth shut or drop the class. Essentially, that same feeling is how underrepresented groups feel in college courses. That's why a level of diversity is important to help students in those groups succeed.","8_1_1_1_11_1"

In a nutshell, the idea is that we all are composed of many different ""identities"", and each one comes with advantages and disadvantages. Socioeconomic status is one. Race is another. Religion, sexuality, physical health, mental health... all of these things are a *part* of who we are, but none of these things constitute *all* of who we are. 

When you look at it through this lens, yes: poor white people are in an oppressed class (SES). Rich black people are also in an oppressed class (race). Rich, white, transgender people are also in an oppressed class (gender identity). How do we decide when an identity is considered privileged or oppressed? You can measure it by objective outcomes, and also by how it is handled by the dominant culture. If you took two people who are identical in every measurable way, but one was white and one was black, the black person will typically have less opportunities and worse outcomes than their white counterparts. **This doesn't diminish the struggles of the poor white person**, but it proves that being born black is a disadvantaged starting position. So is being born poor. If you made a character in an RPG, different races and classes give pluses and minuses to different stats. To vastly oversimplify things: if an identity gives an overall advantage, it's considered privileged. If it gives an overall disadvantage, it's considered oppressed. 

It gets very complicated when we try to decide which types of oppression need more attention: should we be more concerned about poverty or race? Sexuality or religion? In my opinion, it isn't helpful to have an either/or mentality about it. It's not a competition - ""you think being *black* is hard? I'm in a wheelchair and I'm a furry!"" It's better to have a yes/and approach. ""Yes, minorities deal with struggles. Poor people also deal with struggles. We should figure out how to help both situations."" That's where SJWs get into trouble: they get so focused on one set of social problems that they disparage ""mainstream"" people who also have serious problems. 

Alright, so what to do about it? How do you un-rig the system? I used the poker analogy because game theory is really helpful for this. The two poker players are just trying their best to win, using any resources necessary. It's not the wealthier player's *fault* for starting the game with more chips, and they have every right to maximize that advantage. If the dealer does nothing, the problem will not fix itself. Both sides will play their hardest, but advantages tend to snowball and compound over time. **Allowing the rigged game to play out without intervention is not going to un-rig it.** 

So what do you do? Doing nothing won't work. Even if all discrimination of all types stopped today, oppressed people will largely stay oppressed because they're starting the game at a huge disadvantage. So do you take everyone's money and redistribute it? That won't work. ""Race quotas"" won't work, because that boils people down to one identity (race) when there's so much more to consider. In my opinion, a couple viable solutions are to 1) provide resources specifically for disadvantaged groups (e.g. FAFSA) to give them a chance to compete, and 2) factor-in disadvantaged identities when choosing between similarly-qualified individuals (e.g. AA).","8_1_1_1_13_1_2_1_1_1"

The underlying gap between our two perspectives is this question: Is it racist to actively acknowledge and attempt to combat the effects of racism? That's where our views diverge.

Race is already used to differentiate between otherwise equal people in so many ways in so many areas of life. Because that's the reality I know and live, it's perfectly logical to me that there are policies out there that are race-based. Some lived experiences ARE race-specific. So, to me, racism is complaining on principle about an effort to address racism, yet being totally apathetic towards every other expression of actual racism itself.

I agree race shouldn't be a factor at all. I don't think it should be a factor anywhere. It shouldn't be a factor in primary education, but studies show that teachers more readily and severely punish black students than white ones, and they are less likely to encourage/mentor them after failures (seeing as it's harder to ""see a young version of themselves"" in students of color). It shouldn't be a factor in whether I get a job interview, but studies show that ""urban"" names get dramatically lower rates of callbacks than white-sounding names with identical resumes. It shouldn't be a factor if I eventually get the job, but studies show that black college grads have about the same employment rates as white high school dropouts. It shouldn't be a factor in how much I pay for rent, but studies show I'm liable to be charged more for my apartment than a white person with the same income and credit. It shouldn't be a factor in how the criminal justice system treats me, but there's mountains of evidence illustrating that blacks are more severely incarcerated that whites for the same crimes.

However, if you believe with all your heart that the true definition of racism is 'focusing too much on race,' then I understand why race-based affirmative action might be offensive to you.

To be clear, I'm not actually interested in trying to convince you of anything. I'm sure you can read every little example of real racism I listed and refute them perfectly comfortably, whether you actually live this life or not. I don't need the stats, I've personally lived all those trends, and all I can do is be honest and let others take it or leave it.

Theoretically at some point in the future the historically advantaged races should be on equal footing.  At that point in time, these institutions would need to abolish affirmative action in order to retain any semblance of fairness.  But the perception of of racism may still linger, and these institutions would face massive public backlash in leveling the playing field.

This has already happened with gender and college.  Female enrollment surpassed male enrollment decades ago and the gap continues to widen, all due to policies and programs put into place when women needed it.  But you couldn't possibly dismantle these programs now that they're superfluous without calls of sexism.

Similarly, you say:

&gt; factor in how the criminal justice system treats me, but there's mountains of evidence illustrating that blacks are more severely incarcerated that whites for the same crimes.

The gap is bigger between how the criminal justice system treats men and women than how it treat whites and blacks.  E.g., blacks have on average a 10% longer sentence for the same crime, while men have on average a *70%* longer sentence than a woman for the same crime.

You are also missing the trees for the forest, so to speak.  Affirmative action is basically saying that two wrongs *do* make a right, that the disadvantage a black person faces in life is a wrong that can be corrected by doing another wrong to a white person who is personally guilty of nothing and yet will be rejected from an institution he otherwise would have qualified for.

That question is less about ""do you think racism is real"" and more about your beliefs regarding personal agency.

The problem is an impoverished ethnic group.  

Poverty leads to crime, crime leads to a criminal perception which leads to discrimination in the Justice system and more crime.  Poverty leads to an education deficit which leads to crime.

I agree (although I would add ""or what they look like."" to the end of that sentence).

Beliefs about personal agency are heavily influenced (at least on this issue) by your understanding of racism and whether or not you accept it as real. When people talk about systemic racism, they're talking about the ways in which society strips certain minorities of that very agency.

It's funny, from my perspective, things are switched. It's losing the forest for the trees, as you perfectly put it, to worry more about ""two wrongs making a right"" than to do what we can to actively combat, however imperfectly, the first wrong, which is so obviously (to me, at least) WAYYYYY more impactful and damaging than the second ""wrong"" of affirmative action. I find comparing the two to be a totally false equivalency. I think some of my hope for outlining how affirmative action actually looks in Admissions is to help illuminate why I feel that way.

The catchphrase, ""When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression"" comes to mind.
 
I'm really not bothered by female enrollment outpacing men (black enrollment def isn't there yet, so good on the ladies I suppose). That stat just pales in comparison to my understanding of all the challenges women face (historically and today), especially in academic and professional spheres. My college only began accepting women in 1983. If we're really interesting in fairness, then why not spend 229 years exclusively accepting women, and then we can talk about gender-blind admissions? I think it's perfectly noble to advocate for more equal sentencing along gender lines...but that just doesn't detract from the fact that it's also racially unequal (at least, it doesn't in my personal opinion).

I think we're clearly going to disagree, which is cool, but until I see this nation roll out that ""real solution"" and actually put in a sincere and effective effort to fix education and do all the things that need to be done to truly achieve a level playing field (economically AND racially), then I find any passion for dismantling race-based affirmative action to be at best premature and at worst a conscious effort to restore a very nasty status quo.

Yes, Affirmative Action has done a lot more benefit along gender lines than race.

This is simply not true. No top-tier university will admit applicants who aren't qualified. That's setting both sides up for failure. Accepting undeserving students is counterproductive. The number of qualified applicants far exceeds the number of open spots at Ivies and like institutions. When making those decisions, admissions officers look for qualities that differentiate a specific applicant from the rest of the student body. Lived experience factors into that.

Take 2 students with equal credentials from a wealthy, predominantly white high school. One is Black, one is white. The school looks at their student body, and sees that they have 12 white students from that school and zero Black students. They're looking for the most diverse student body possible.

Students are selected to suit university goals, of which race is only one possible factor. Is it any less discriminatory to consider me based on, say, the region I was raised in, than on the color of my skin? Both are factors beyond my control, but either can shape what the university views as my contribution to the makeup of the class.

The difference, of course, is that there is a law requiring race to be a factor, which is a thorn for a lot of people, and not without reason. In this case, however, it's inclusive rather than exclusive, which would more aptly fit the term ""institutional racism.""

Race is big issue currently. On one hand, there's so much positive change that can come from allowing ourselves to have frank discussions about it. On the other, it's lead some people to the (I'd argue) false notion that ""colorblindness"" is ideal. While race should play a positive discussion of ourselves as a community, many have grown to fear any discussion of race at all.

You can believe in that and still not think it's the best solution. I don't believe there's a particular racism-based bias in people evaluating college applications (and you're in a better position to tell me if I'm wrong here or not by evaluating what your peers were like). I do understand there would be a racial preference when looking at scores alone, for the same reason you cited here:

&gt;legacy kids (children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of alums)...Those kids are a pretty exclusively white demographic because of...you know...how history works.

For the same reason, kids from minority backgrounds are less likely to have parents who graduated from college and can help them with their homework. They're more likely to have poor parents, which means less opportunities in general for extra-curricular activities. Their parents are less likely to have contacts that can give their children interesting educational High School jobs and a leg up on their career. This is all true. And this all happens in their life long before college.

Now people tell me the solution is to throw them in a competitive environment with people who did have all those opportunities? You're setting these kids up for failure. Of course some will work hard and succeed. Many will instead accumulate years of debt and drop out.

We do need to do something about this social inequality, but we need to address them far earlier, starting with elementary schools.  We need to have programs with adult classes designed to help their parents. We need to have tutoring programs to give these kids the homework help they can't get from their parents due to their parents' lack of education. We need to make sure we can prepare disadvantaged kids for college, so they don't need affirmative action quotas to get in. 

There's no reason these programs need to consider race: you can just consider income. Due to historical reasons, that will include more minorities, which is great, but they don't need to include people like you who happens to be black, but were born in an affluent family. I'm sure you didn't encounter these issues we're talking about, and was well prepared for the Ivy League school you attended. Similarly there are poor white families that could benefit from these programs just as much.

There are certainly some things in our society which are very much racial discrimination. The justice system tends to be pretty skewed against black individuals, for instance. This is something where we do need to take race into consideration when working to fix it. But, in my experience, college admission isn't one of these things. Most universities don't tend to be bigoted in this day and age, the need for affirmative action comes from the socioeconomic legacy of past prejudice.","8_1_1_1_15"

I don't consider myself enough of an expert to provide any sweeping legislative or policy prescriptions. However, I do think there is valid frustration out there when it comes to increasing socioeconomic diversity on campuses. I just don't believe that it needs to come at the cost of race-based considerations.

I basically felt (and again, this is all 100% my personal opinion based on my own experiences) that the university would try as much as possible to kill two birds with one stone by pulling in underserved racial minorities to make up the majority of the ""poor kid"" population, but it's still such a small slice of the total class make-up. By a large margin, the vast majority of students were still upper-middle class (and richer) white kids. 

I'd like to see a more concerted effort to really make college accessible financially to everyone without ruining lives with student debt.

I just want to let people know that from a race neutral position, I heartily disagree with your post, as I find your justification flimsy, and question your neutrality in using the justifications you chose- which also seem to be coincidentally the reasons which can defend your self admitted advantages as a black person, despite your affluence (not that we should try to right historically inheritted poverty-because that doesn't apply to you, but because of ""benefits"" from racially diverse viewpoints...hmmm sounds dubious). I also think that private institutions can do whatever they want. Allow me to show why this is on thin ice logically speaking, and why this type of approach to affirmative action is wrong in general and immoral for public institutions.

You argue that bringing in people from different racial backgrounds brings a diversity of viewpoints which enrich the classroom experiences. What if race never enters the discussion? In computer science for example, everyone's race is orthoginal to the task of learning, and actually cultural cohesion might be advantageous in learning. Where are you getting this idea that your experience as a black person has any value to me. Sorry, but I'm just paying to get trained for a good career, not a cultural experience that includes anyone's particular race.

Not that I would argue for promotion of a  uni-culture learning environment either, because to be honest, I don't care about culture as much as ideas, and by focusing on race we mus forgo a far more important cultural experience that we should be teaching: beleif in logic, race-blind-fairness and merit. I think the shared ideals that success will come from having better work habits than the competitiom, and that meritocratic systems are the best type of systems would breed better cohesion than your choosing winners and losers based on race. I would just want to know that everyone I'm studying with got there by earning it the same way I did - fair competition and hard work. How are you going to tell young asian or white men to love diversity when you tell them to study hard for success, and then unfairly pull the rug out from under them because ""racial diversity gives viewpoints"". Most people can accept losing if the game's rules are neutral towards their race - but when my race (which I never chose) acts against me... It sends a terrible message and tax dollars going to public institutions should not be promoting such harmful actions on the psyches of asian and white men.

At least at the elite university level, intelligence is not determined by test scores and GPA alone, ever, even excluding considerations of race.

Frankly, everyone who we consider has the raw academic performance to impress us. They're all exceedingly intelligent (and hardworking). And we know that grades and test scores are not objective or universal metrics. So, like I've written elsewhere, a 2100 from a kid in the state's most underserved school is more impressive than a yet another 2400 from a kid from a fantastic school where ten other kids with the same GPA and test scores are applying to the same university. On the flip side, we were also aware that a 3.9 from a disaster public school may be different than a 3.5 from an elite boarding school.


So how do we make sure the ""most intelligent"" person gets in? For what it's worth, the tiny handful of kids who were demonstrably geniuses (the literal kind)? Of course they get in. We'll take a future nobel prize winner every time. Beyond that, we evaluate the whole person, not just their transcript. That is why personal essays and extracurriculars and personal hardships (and yes, even race or country of origin) come into consideration - ""most qualified"" encompasses more than just ""best test scores."" Having the best grades doesn't mean you're the smartest (I say that as a relatively average dude who happens to be a fantastic student), and it doesn't mean you automatically have more to contribute to the university than everyone else. We don't just want people with good study habits, we also really want to graduate future billionaires, presidents, CEO's, famous directors, scientists, etc. At least, that's the rationale. It was less ""who is the smartest"" and more ""who is the best at what they do (and also smart enough to thrive on this campus?)"" Again, you don't have to agree with it, but Admissions just IS a holistic process. However, to be fair, if I saw all this energy against affirmative action paired with a widespread passion for removing every single consideration outside of grades and tests (no extracurriculars considered, no personal essays, no legacy student considerations, no names even, just standardized test scores), then I'd be more sympathetic to that viewpoint.

In my experience, I saw the Admissions staff be surprisingly aggressive about accommodating for the fact that parents can (and do) effectively just buy their kids better experiences for their resumes, but the policies we put in place were designed by the University itself. I wouldn't go so far as to say there was a quota, but an active effort was taken to ensure that as many students as the university could afford to bring in (my school committed to meeting 100% of every admitted student's financial need), we brought in. It was one of our prominent talking points for prospective students and their families, as it was effectively a form of affirmative action that nobody pushed back against (unlike most discussion about race-based considerations). I personally don't think we did enough. The clear majority of my class was definitely upper-middle class and above. However, economic diversity was just as heavily targeted as any other kind (including, in my experience, racial diversity).

Basically, we were well aware there's a point of diminishing returns if the entire campus is filled with just rich brats.

The effect that affirmative action has is to reclassify the underprivileged, who most people are impressed to see succeeding, into the same privileged class as those rich kids we hate. All of a sudden there was a group of people who had gotten a privilege just because of the circumstances of their birth and when I saw those kids in school, I knew that they hadn't gotten there on merit. Why wouldn't most people start to resent those who were being treated differently? At work most people might start to think that some of the other employees didn't have the same skills, but just got the job out of discrimination.

This doesn't mean that people who benefited from affirmative action are not as good or didn't work as hard, it just means that most people would start to look down on anyone who they think got ahead as the result of a privilege.

There is nothing that can be done to make everyone feel that things are fair or to ever make things actually fair, but if the majority of the population perceives something as unfair then they are going to resent it, which may not make a difference to those who actually benefit from privilege, like the wealthy kids who become CEOs, but it sure will hurt those who never got a privilege but are still treated like they did. This person who most exemplifies this type of thinking is Clarence Thomas. Look at what he says about affirmative action: http://www.businessinsider.com/how-clarence-thomas-grew-to-hate-affirmative-action-2013-10

He said his law degree was only worth 15 cents, but he became a fucking goddam Supreme Court Justice. ","8_1_1_1_25"

It's a textbook recipe for skyrocketing tuition costs and useless administrators profiting off loans. We need the availability of easy money to go away, so that colleges don't have a source of income for their skyrocketing costs, and we need people to be able to make money so they can pay their own tuition upfront. It'll be an awful correction to the market and it'll hurt people in the short run, but we're facing the alternative of a generation indentured by higher education.

Conversely, to assume someone has a unique and valuable perspective just because they check a box describing to their race seems like cut and dry racial stereotyping -- for any race. It may be a mostly positive assumption, but it is still an extremely lazy and non-egalitarian way of deciding some of the most important decisions in these kids' lives.

There's actually another reason to consider race (and gender) as well. There have been numerous studies on how well a person does if they are in an extreme minority in a college program. For example, imagine you have a group of physics majors taking an advanced physics class, and there is one black student in that class. Or imagine you have an advanced mathematics class with one woman in it. The stereotype threat those students feel are extreme. 

There have been studies done that show a student in that situation doesn't feel comfortable asking questions in class or asking for help in general. Thus, they are more likely to struggle, and feel like they are letting their race/gender down. They're highly likely to drop out.

Basically, to help underrepresented groups succeed in universities, there needs to be a certain threshold of those groups in the classes. If you are a white man reading this, imagine how you might feel if you were the only man in a gender studies class or the only man in an African American history class. You might feel like everything you say is up for scrutiny, that people are judging you as racist or sexist. So, you might just choose to keep your mouth shut or drop the class. Essentially, that same feeling is how underrepresented groups feel in college courses. That's why a level of diversity is important to help students in those groups succeed.","8_1_1_1_32"

[Well, black students fail to complete college at 150% the rate of average.  If ""probabillity to matriculate/graduate"" is the driving factor, someone being black should actually count against them in admissions.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/26/college-completion-rates-vary-race-and-ethnicity-report-finds)

At four-year institutions, black men completed their degrees at the lowest rate (40 percent) and Asian women at the highest (75.7 percent).

Before the downvotes flood in, I'm not advocating that black people should be denied admissions spots because they're black.  That would be awful.  However, affirmative action in college admissions does result in a disproportionately large number of minorities, particularly black men, being admitted to universities when they are not prepared for the academic rigor, contributing to their increased rates of failing to graduate.  That may or may not be the case at your particular institution, but as a trend across higher education, affirmative action admissions decisions may be doing more harm than good, saddling individuals with large amounts of debt that they lack the credentials to be able to pay back.

P.S. 

Have you ever smelled the algae on the Boston river as you settle into the rowing boat for your 5am practice? I learned many things that day. As we left the riverbank and silently glided into the morning fog, I looked at my dear friend, Duke Worthington Junior. He was a rookie and a scoundrel. His shoulder muscles breathed under the Phillips academy jersey for a minute until he turned around to ask me for leadership advice. Being an executive board member of the philanthropy club, I was used to mentoring the incoming students in my school. As we churned the silver gray surface of the water, I told him about having grit to stick with classes for the semester. It was of outmost importance to finish with good grades in order to be a respectable member of high society. 

The conversation reminded me of a time I founded a successful startup. The basic premise was to live in poverty for one year and write a documentary about my plight. This was a life changing experience in many ways and a sharp contrast to the opulent lifestyle I led as the senator's son. My grandfather, the great pioneer of anti-prohibition legislature was very proud of my accomplishments. He told me one day: ""son, you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you should try to fit an Oscar in there for dessert"". Little did I know that two year later I would do just that, with an Oscar I received for best leadership. 

Back to Duke Worthington Junior, he was so enthralled with my story that he fell out of the boat and was fighting for his life as he couldn't swim. This was a formative moment for me. A moment that shaped my character to never give up and be admitted as a legacy applicant into Harvard. As I pondered on my leadership ability and my perseverance, I dove into the river and grabbed Duke Worthington by the jersey and screamed: ""will you also pledge 50% of your income to the alma matter? Will you worship at the altar of the Almighty Dollar until the invisible hand of the market rewards you generously for your lack of moral compass? ""BRLGHHHG"", the Duke replied. And that was enough for me. 

My father once told me that Harvard is the second wealthiest non-governmental organization in the world. Second only to the Vatican. If there is anything I took away from that fateful day when I saved Duke Worthington Junior from the his algae-smelling demise, it is that I will not rest, I will not stop, until Harvard surpasses the Pope and his henchmen in material wealth. Good day to you, admissions, officer.","8_1_1_1_36"

It doesn't.  It accurately reflects the specific disadvantages accruing due to the student's race.

What people opposed to affirmative action choose not to understand is that a Caucasian student, in relation to a black or Hispanic student, essentially receives the benefits of affirmative action their entire life up to that point.

So, imagine a black student and a white student.  Both are the children of professionals making a lower-middle-class income.

At the start, that white student is more likely to be in a wealthier neighborhood, because generations of redlining, housing discrimination and legal plunder have worked to segregate even successful minorities into poor neighborhoods -- a black family making a six-figure income and a white family making a $50,000 income are likely to be living in neighborhoods of equivalent wealth, while a white family with a six-figure income is likely to be living in a nicer neighborhood than either.  So, at the start, the black student is likely to located somewhere with worse schools, fewer extracurricular resources, and lower available social capital than his white doppelganger. 

But say the black and white students end up in the same school.  Say they both make the same rude comment in third grade.  Particularly if the faculty is white, the black student is more likely to be punished for the offense (e.g., being seen as ""insolent"" rather than ""cheeky and expressive""), and more likely to receive a harsher punishment if caught.  (Studies find that minority students not only have a higher number of reported infractions, but a higher proportion of these infractions are discretionary -- i.e., minority and white students might be equally likely to be caught for committing tangible, objective offenses like vandalism, but minority students are more likely to be hit with subjective offenses like ""being disruptive."")  

The black student is also less likely to be given attention by the teacher.  The black student is less likely to have a teacher take him under his wing, because ""He reminds me of a young me.""  The black student is less likely to be encouraged if he fails, or seem like a good investment by his teachers.  The black student is less likely to be given a break to be let into a sought-after extracurricular.  Less likely to have a neighbor or family member that can give him a internship that looks good on application. 

All of these little differences, every little benefit of the doubt the white kid gets that the black kid doesn't, are effectively a lifelong affirmative action program that leaves the field uneven by the time kids are applying to college, and can leave the minority student with deceptively low marks on ""objective"" criteria despite equivalent aptitude.

I have felt the sting of sexism. I'm a female software developer. You have no idea how I have been treated by shitty white men (and black men and Asian men). But I still hate the idea that I got my job just because I'm a woman. I got my job because I am damn good at what I do.

The way affirmative action works (as I understand it) means that Ben Carson's daughter will have yet another advantage that my poor white neighbor is denied. I knew wealthy kids in high school who reached into their family trees to find that 1/8 Navajo so they could get into a better school. I knew a shitty contractor who made his wife a 51% owner of his company so he could game government contracts that favor women. Affirmative action policies are deeply flawed and ignoring that is wrong, too (although not nearly as wrong as ignoring there is a problem to begin with). Should race/gender be used as a tie-breaker? Sure, I'm OK with that, but not if it diminishes the quality of work I'm getting. It would be ideal if companies' demographics reflect the demographics of the applications they receive. And I love government and charitable organizations supporting minorities and women as they look for work or apply for college. I think they do more to fight inequality than affirmative action does.

When it comes to college, I'd rather they look at family income. Because of the dismal state of racial inequality in this country, that will still pick up a disproportionate number of black and other minority students while also helping low-income white and Asian students who get the short end of this particular stick. I also would like to see a strong commitment to helping these kids more once they get to college since they likely went to crappy high schools and may struggle more than their peers. I do doubt the wisdom of taking a child who had a shitty high school education and setting them up to fail at a university.

All of that said, I love that people are flat-out ignoring that I said I'm against this move by the DOJ. It is absolutely a bunch of bullshit pushed by a bunch of racist pricks. Although I don't like affirmative action, I'd rather spend our time on other issues. Frankly, I've already spent more time typing about this than I would like. I just wanted to make the point that I both dislike affirmative action and still detest the racist actions this administration is taking. Can we at least agree that they're a bunch of pricks?

LOL yes. Yes, we can. Also, I should have used more particular language. I was speaking more generally than specifically at you. I feel like your post made your stance pretty clear. I just wanted to make sure the other perspective was vocalized as well, sorry if you're getting downvoted or whatever for it.

The instances you provided are abuses of affirmative action, which I'm not personally convinced should be used to judge the policies themselves. Kind of like when people get up in arms about ""welfare queens,"" when whatever abuses may or may not be happening there don't negate the need for social safety nets (in my own personal opinion).

I can speak directly to affirmative action in college admissions, so that's what I'll do here. I'm going to share an explainer I wrote earlier:

""I do want to push back gently against the narrative and assumptions about people being on campuses or in schools where they do not belong. Not to get too boring, but it's important to remember universities are (way too often, in my opinion) basically businesses. In admissions, you don't just look at letting kids in...you consider things like matriculation rates and keeping ALL your stats as competitive as possible (ex: a HIGH graduation rate, a LOW acceptance rate, etc.). You need those stats to be great so that more students the following cycle will want to apply to your school, go to your school, and pay you money for educating them.

For example, I did see highly qualified kids get rejected when the university felt for whatever reason that the odds of them actually enrolling were low (maybe their family has a strong history at a different university or they didn't make a convincing enough case that they would choose us over a similar institution if accepted). Similarly, it makes zero sense to accept kids who are not going to make it to graduation. A low graduation rate is bad news for the university, so it's really not like all you have to do is check ""African-American"" or ""Native American"" on the application and that's that.

My experience working in that Admissions office really convinced me that it's a balancing act in many ways, even outside of race. Yes, you want to craft an appealingly diverse class, but you need to do so with as little risk as possible. The priority is actually keeping the university's stats competitive so that students for years to come will want to attend our school, as opposed to a similarly great one with whom we are competing for that tuition money. You need to accept a class that's diverse so the best students (regardless of background) will feel comfortable applying, but also with as high an academic performance history as possible, which increases the odds that the largest possible percentage of students actually graduate, get a great job, and then donate lots of money to the university as alums. I used to actually tell this to prospective students pretty often to ease their nerves a little bit about the acceptance process (God, I remember how stressful waiting to find out where I might get into college was).

Applicants need to perform well enough to leave no doubt that they could hack it on campus, but past that basic threshold, academic performance takes a backseat to whether you bring something to the table that the next kid with the same exact scores and grades as you (if not better) doesn't, and whether or not what you uniquely bring fits in with whatever the admissions staff has already decided they want that class makeup to look like. For example, once we had the pile of applicants we were simply sure could hold their own in the classroom, we literally broke things down into certain fractions of not race, but creatives vs. scientists vs. entrepreneurs vs. first-generation college students vs. local applicants, etc. etc. etc. Race is just one part of all that juggling and shuffling to craft the right kind of class for the university's goals that particular year.

Just an added layer of complexity in an already very complicated issue to ponder. ""

So, does Ben Carson's daughter have some advantages over some poor white kid? Hell yes, but the WAY bigger advantages will frankly be that she is rich enough and her dad is famous/connected enough for her application to college to be so completely chock full of unique experiences that I'm sure universities will be clamoring to snatch her up.

Would any generic wealthy black kid have an edge over a poorer white kid? Honestly, not necessarily. That would boil down to how many other black kids are under consideration, what those applications might look like, how inspiring the poor white applicants personal triumphs over poverty have been, how confident the school is in either applicant's ability to perform well academically, how much emphasis the school has chosen to place on geographic/socioeconomic diversity that year for whatever reason, and so on and so forth. These sorts of acceptance (and, I'm sure, hiring) decisions are just a way more complicated than people of color having unearned opportunities thrown their way left and right, which is the assumption I see a lot online (although not from you, to be totally clear this time lol).","18_2_1_1_1"

There's a reason we at UCLA call USC the university of spoiled children. That is a separate issue.

AA leads to mismatching in which students get into universities above their qualified capacity. This leads to higher risk of failing. Just as many African-American students are graduating today as they did when UCLA and all the other UCs utilized AA. Why? It got rid of the mismatch issue in which there were once students who had no business being on campus with their qualifications. There was a great study over this at the university of Texas awhile back with some good data showing actual results.

If my fellow liberals really cared about fixing the skills/education mismatch, they would make an effort to improve upon primary/secondary education in African-American communities.

This doesn't change my view of affirmative action at all. AA is stupid racist bullshit. How about working to fix the core issue instead of this pathetic bandaid fix that results in a company looking at two equally qualified candidates and deciding ""well, you're black / don't have a penis, so you get the job because in general your demographic has less advantages.""

I'm white, male, and poor. AA actively works against me and I don't have the money for daddy to buy my way into anywhere or the connections to have a job just handed to me, so I'm being put at a disadvantage because of the color of my skin and my gender. That's fucking stupid but so many people think it's ok because ""dur as a minority / woman I'm discriminated against so much more and white males get all the breaks."" That's neat and all that ""the white man"" in general is keeping you down, but what about all of the specific people this shit harms? So you don't want equality? You just want to throw some other group under the bus so you get your turn? You don't want to attack the core issue of wealth inequality, you just want a turn to be the majority and watch as others are discriminated against... Fuck you.

I despise AA and this bullshit ""reverse racism."" I hate Trump and I hate what the Republicans are doing, but honestly this is how you create Trump supporters. You go around with all of the ""reverse racism"", saying white people can't be discriminated against because they're the majority, constant white shaming, shows like ""Dear White People"", having people on tv saying ""white people are the devils of society"", etc. That is how you **create racists**. Shoving poor white people into the dirt and making them feel ashamed for the color of their skin will cause their anger to turn from the rich at the top to those who are constantly shaming them for who they are.

&gt; Still, in conversations and debates over just who gets the biggest leg up in university admissions, the tale of how senior White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner got into Harvard is an instructive one.

&gt; What Golden found, essentially, was that Jared&amp;#039;s father handed Harvard a big pile of money just as Jared was starting to apply to colleges.

&gt; A source close to the family told me that New Jersey senator Frank Lautenberg, to whom Kushner and his family gave nearly $100,000 from 1992 to 2002, turned to Massachusetts senator Edward Kennedy to boost Jared&amp;#039;s Harvard prospects.

&gt;Many of those students may come from wealthy families. (Or overseas, according to this 2007 Harvard Crimson article.)  Sander's research into the files at one unnamed ""very elite college"" shows that in 1999, there was only a 4% chance  a black student with SAT scores above 1200 but from the bottom 20% of socioeconomic status would even apply for admission. Equally qualified black students from the top quintile had a 48% chance of applying.

It is interesting that in the finding the chief justice carved out an exception for military schools. Now ostensibly this is because these institutions already curtail their students liberties. Ie school uniforms, appearance and certain speech.

I take a different view. While this new ruling now further curtails  minority peoples freedom, it is not equally applied. See above.

This to me is exactly the point. The military schools will remain % wise more diverse, while civilian institutions will become less so.

The great % chance that the military graduates will join our armed services is almost a guarantee. 

Whereas the civilian schools will be far less likely to.

You see what I am driving at here?

There will be more minorities in the military and possibly in danger from any adventures our country decides to undertake.

To me this is hugely disingenuous and very likely planned.

We dont want minorities to be educated, but have no problem letting minorities serve and possibly die for our country.","23"

Lots of people would disagree with that statement, but I would refer them to Jefferson's statement about the sovereignty of the living. We are not beholden to those dead white men, as much as conservatives try to force the issue. We are alive *now*. We can decide what our values are *now*. 

The dead white men mind-reading is not a rational way to make decisions. That's why we have so much xian bullshit infecting everything. We have to establish a standard of rational argument *only* as a basis for legal rulings. It applies to lower courts but the scotus is too lofty for that? They get to be oracles of the divine founders? Ridiculous.

The court's power should be checked by the citizenry as the last backstop against a captured government. Which is what we are facing now.

(His other major policy pillar is fighting wokeness.)
&gt;
&gt; Since announcing his presidential run in February, Ramaswamy has railed against what he refers to as preferencesrace, gender, legacy status, etc.in college admissions and in hiring, saying entrance into both areas should be based on pure merit.
&gt;
&gt; He has called race-based admissions a cancer on our national soul, promised that as president he would end race-conscious college admissions on Day One without apology, and identified the defeat of affirmative action as the tip of the spear of my policy agenda.
&gt;
&gt; Ramaswamy cheered the Supreme Courts decision to end race-conscious admissions at Harvard, his undergraduate alma mater, despite the school noting that no students are admitted on the basis of race alone.
&gt;
&gt;But as he made his way through two Ivy League universities, Ramawamy himself benefitted from a generous fellowship intended to provide opportunity and equity to groups who have historically often faced systemic barriers to success.
&gt;
&gt; Moreover, that fellowship came by way of the Soros family. (Yes, that would be the family of George Sorosthe right wings all-purpose boogeyman.)

What we have here is best summed up as *yet another* Republican case of, Rules for thee, but not for me.

There is an article by the NY Times just this morning about how a recent study of elite college admissions data shows being very rich is its own qualification.

They wrote:

&gt; Elite colleges have long been filled with the children of the richest families: At Ivy League schools, one in six students has parents in the top 1 percent.
&gt;
&gt; A large new study released Monday, shows that it has not been because these children had more impressive grades on average or took harder classes. They tended to have higher SAT scores and finely honed résumés, and applied at a higher rate  but they were overrepresented even after accounting for those things. For applicants with the same SAT or ACT score, children from families in the top 1 percent were 34 percent more likely to be admitted than the average applicant, and those from the top 0.1 percent were more than twice as likely to get in.

While I agree with Ramaswamy that legacy admissions are problematic, he is very wrong on most other things& and as we now know he benefited from the very things he wants to take away from others.

There are very real systemic issues in a society that is still very much ingrained with racism, sexism, and bigotry of all kinds. Thus, we continue to need affirmative action and other measures to level the playing field for minorities and other disadvantaged groups. 

And as the NY Times article illustrates - being wealthy alone continues to give greater access to higher education - *even with all other things being equal.*

We remain a very long way from having any equality in education (from kindergarten onward). 

And there are many other forces at work too.

Until there is more equality and inclusion in our society, college admissions based only on academic merit will mostly benefit those born with the most advantages.

Just a spoiler alert: Arundhati Roy isn't a historian by any measure. The 'Caste System' for most of Indian history has only ever been a social ideal with only some success of implementation and equal opposition to it by various philosophical movements (Jainism &amp; Buddhism), religious movements (Lingyat &amp; Bhakti Movements) and social movements (19th-century social reform movements).   
India had a very dynamic society throughout its history (one of the major reasons being that the concept of Pvt property goes back to ancient times) and as such Varna (then Caste) and Jati system are way more complex than they are portrayed in the mainstream.

I agree they misuse tax payers dollars but Democrats do that even worse. So both are wrong.

And yes, why would we fund failing systems? It makes no logical sense.

But do you believe in censorship? Should someone like Alex Jones or Milo been censored? In the case of books, here's the issue. Public schooling is pretty much a monopoly. Now they we are forced to send our kids to school, I can't blame parents for being outraged by it. If most people are collectively saying they don't want that in the class we have to abide according to our system. However, if schools were privatized like they should be instead of a government monopoly, than any school should be free to do as they please. If they want to ban certain books, fine. If they want to welcome all books, fine. 

I don't believe in hunting down pregnant women either. I think abortion should be legal. Republicans are 100 percent wrong about this.

&gt; ""But for them, God only knows where I would be today,"" said Thomas, who was EEOC chairman from 1982 to 1990. ""These laws and their proper application are all that stand between the first 17 years of my life and the second 17.""

Affirmative action quite literally consists of explicit racial discrimination in favor of certain groups and against others.

&gt; qualified students

""Qualified"" is meaningless here, since we are discussing candidates who would be rejected for underperformance but for the racial preference they receive. 

&gt; They arent just choosing random people to fill those spots.

No, of course not - but they are choosing people who underperform on the basis of their race, absent which their underperformance would render them noncompetitive. 

&gt; It is correcting the racist roots of these institutions.

What does this concretely mean?

&gt; It really is a shame the narrative is that those who benefit from affirmative action arent qualified or deserving of their acceptance to college. They arent taking spots away from others who are more deserving.

In what sense are they 'qualified', given that they would have been rejected as academically noncompetitive absent a racial preference? 

&gt; People who say that are racist and/or salty about not getting in. 

Or just accurate? 

&gt; Limited number of spots means not everyone gets in. But there are plenty of great schools in the country, so dont despair.

Perhaps that will be a consolation in the years to come, when racial discrimination in admissions is no longer permitted, for the people who cannot get into wherever it is without a racial boost?
They arent just choosing random people to fill those spots. It is correcting the racist roots of these institutions.

I mean, this needs to be made much more concrete. Sure, education and college admissions have seen lots of racism. But what is the specific point you're making? Are you talking about Stanford and Harvard suppressing Jewish admissions? Jim Crow elementary and middle schools being underfunded? Southern state universities not enrolling black students? A lack of educational options that could reach migrant farm workers' families?

&gt; It isnt racist to attempt to correct the imbalance that discrimination has caused.

This. The idea that ""Asians"" or ""African Americans"" are one monolithic group is real stupid. There are plenty of Asian kids who come from very poor immigrant families (or may even be refugees) but in the current US academic setting, if you check ""Asian"" you are automatically considered to be part of an overrepresented group. Meanwhile, a wealthy upper middle class half Cuban from Iowa could check ""Latino/Hispanic,"" have zero knowledge of their own Hispanic background, likely doesnt even speak Spanish or care about anything re: Cuba, and they will automatically be considered as part of an underrepresented minority.

A recent study found that, since 2000, there were only 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation  the only type of fraud that photo IDs could prevent  during a period of time in which over 1 billion ballots were cast.

Identified instances of fraud are honest mistakes. So-called cases of in-person impersonation voter fraud are almost always the product of an elections worker or a voter making an honest mistake, and that even these mistakes are extremely infrequent.

Voter ID laws are a waste of taxpayer dollars. States incur sizeable costs when implementing voter ID laws, including the cost of educating the public, training poll workers, and providing IDs to voters.

Texas spent nearly $2 million on voter education and outreach efforts following passage of its Voter ID law.  Indiana spent over $10 million to produce free ID cards between 2007 and 2010.","12_1_1_2_1_1"

It doesn't matter how rare it is, in no way should there be any chances that a non citizen votes and in some states they are passing bills to allow it like New York so yeah voter ID is a must in free society. I want to know 100% that every person who votes is citizen of this country not someone living here illegally. 

Everything else is meaningless when the federal government just attempted to give the federal government full control of elections and remove the need to ID to vote. 

Canada has a vouch system, if you don't have an ID someone with an ID can vouch that you are who you say you are and that even is still too much room for fuckery.","12_1_1_2_1_1_1"

Nationally, up to 25% of African-American citizens of voting age lack government-issued photo ID, compared to only 8% of whites.

States exclude forms of ID in a discriminatory manner. Texas allows concealed weapons permits for voting, but does not accept student ID cards. Until its voter ID law was struck down, North Carolina prohibited public assistance IDs and state employee ID cards, which are disproportionately held by Black voters. And until recently, Wisconsin permitted active duty military ID cards, but prohibited Veterans Affairs ID cards for voting.

Voter ID laws are enforced in a discriminatory manner. A Caltech/MIT study found that minority voters are more frequently questioned about ID than are white voters.

Voter ID laws reduce turnout among minority voters. Several studies, including a 2014 GAO study, have found that photo ID laws have a particularly depressive effect on turnout among racial minorities and other vulnerable groups, worsening the participation gap between voters of color and whites.","12_1_1_2_2_1"

&gt;On top of failing to meet strict scrutiny, Alito argued, the university discriminates against Asian-Americans. UT repeatedly expressed the desire to attract and enroll more black and Hispanic students but ignored Asian-Americans. Although based on the state's population, Asian-Americans ""overrepresented"" the student body, one study cited by UT found that more classrooms lacked Asian-Americans than Hispanic students.

&gt;The university also ""lumped"" together Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong, and Indian students, among others, to make up the ""Asian-American"" label, according to Alito.

Increasing access to quality elementary/JHS/HS education for poor people would be a better way of insuring a better chance at higher education. This could be done directly through better schools/teachers, or indirectly through something like better child care services. 

Simply lowering standers to reach quotas creates an artificial feeling of achieving equality. Instead it just creates a feeling of resentment among those who think they have been passed over. I think it would help everyone, even people who do not receive the aid, in the long run. A program like this would cost a hell lot more money though, so I can see why politicians find it so difficult to support.","1_2"

An important characteristic of race and gender is that people can usually figure out your race and gender right away when they first meet you. It's a lot harder to tell what someone's GPA was, or how many times they took to pass the bar, or whether they finished in the top of class, just by looking at them.

So, consider someone faced with a choice between a freshly licensed lawyer or doctor who is white, and one who is black. An average person might be tempted to prefer the white lawyer or doctor, on the assumption that that the risk is higher with the black one that he was someone unqualified who was let through to meet a quota.

NOTE! I'm not saying that is valid reasoning! But it's the kind of reasoning that an average person might use.

When I was a student at Caltech (class of '82), there was a big drive to get more women to attend, but as far as I know, they didn't do it by lowering standards for women, or giving them bonus points (same thing, really).  Rather, they worked hard to get more qualified women to apply.  So, if you were a qualified man, waffling between choosing Caltech or MIT, they might send you a letter extolling the virtues of Caltech.  But if you were a qualified woman, they'd send a recruiter to come talk to you personally, arrange for you to visit the campus, etc..

This seems to me a much better way to increase a minority than affirmative action.

The blog post suggests a similar result. Black students have an average GPA of 2.6, white students of 3.3. Not to mention that 51% of black students are in the bottom 10%, gradewise. If all students are ""equally credentialed,"" this is a highly improbable outcome.

The article posted seems to make a very solid statistical case that in law school minority AA admits far underperform their non-AA counterparts.

I was always as or more qualified than other applicants. If I ever have to I fill out the race box, I go with a random choice. Usually I go with other or decline to state if that is possible. I don't think my race should matter when making any decision, except for the treatment of medical conditions that I might genetically be more prone to. So, personally, I do not agree with AA.

That may be true, to some extent.

But I think that there is another motivation - the sense that an opponent is being dishonest, or trying to pull a fast one. For example, [here](http://politics.reddit.com/info/2lbqo/comments/c2lcfa) we have a downmodded post where someone says that AA works by deciding only among equally rated candidates, and [here](http://politics.reddit.com/info/2lbqo/comments/c2ld8f) we have a highly rated post by a UMich prof that disputes this, citing personal experience and inside knowledge. Are the ratings a reflection of bias, or an assessment of the quality of the post, or a mixture of both? 

I suspect that any bias takes the form of upmodding good posts you agree with, downmodding bad posts you disagree with, and ignoring the rest. People do a good job of policing the opposition, and praising the good deeds of their team. It takes a rare individual to police one's own side, and praise good opposing arguments.

 ""National enrollment figures illustrate that enrollment of people of color has grown from negligible figures when schools were segregated to about 20% of the nation's post-secondary education students...African Americans comprise 9.2% of enrollment, Chicano/Latinos are at 4.9%, Asian Americans also 4.9% and American Indians at 0.7% in four year institutions. However, yearly gains are minimal. It has taken twenty years to arrive at this point. Even though white women have advanced in some areas, white women managers and administrators earned only 65% as much as white men.

Many articles fail to acknowledge the multifaceted dynamics of affirmative action which incorporate Latinos, Chicanos, Asians, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and women.

**Legal Background**

[*Hunter v. Erickson*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_v._Erickson)- a city council prohibited any housing ordinances discriminating based on race. The Supreme Court struck it down as a violation of Equal Protection because it found that the city had racial discrimination issues in the past and that the ordinance was put in place essentially to shut minorities out of city council discussions about housing issues in Akron.

[*Washington v. Seattle School District No. 1*](http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/458/457/case.html)- Law put in place by Seattle School board saying that busing (letting students in one neighborhood attend another school for a different neighborhood) for *any* reason was not allowed. The Supreme Court also struck down this law, as it found the Seattle School District historically to have racial segregation issues and that desegregation was heavily reliant on busing. The Court established the **""political process"" test** for these situations: If a legal body (1) changes a law that ""inures primarily to the benefit of a minority"" by (2) placing the decisionmaking authority of that racially beneficial law at another level of government, it violates Equal Protection.

**Factual Background**

So that sets up the tests generally for violating Equal Protection. Here's the Michigan-specific background on how this most recent case came to the Supreme Court.

Michigan affirmative action cases: [*Grutter v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grutter_v._Bollinger) and [*Gratz v. Bollinger*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratz_v._Bollinger). Sometime in the early 1990s, The University of Michigan established racial factors of varying degrees in their schools. The undergraduate system awarded points toward the total required for admission for being a racial minority. The law school used race as a ""plus factor"" for balancing out law classes with diverse participants. Grutter and Gratz were students that applied to the law school and undergraduate college, respectively, of the University of Michigan. Both were denied admission, are white, and claimed their denials were due to racial discrimination, essentially being on the wronged side of affirmative action. Both cases made their way to the Supreme Court, and the Court ruled on them both at the same time.

The *Grutter* case (the plus factor, but not a quota) was ruled as a valid exercise of affirmative action and that it did not violate Equal Protection because it was not a quota and was not used invidiously against any race. The *Gratz* case (providing automatic points for being a minority) was seen as a violation of Equal Protection because it provided an automatic advantage for simply being a racial minority.

In response to those Michigan cases, Grutter (and many others) petitioned across the state of Michigan to take advantage of their state constitutional right to amend the constitution via popular referendum. They proposed that the Michigan constitution be amended to prohibit any affirmative action policies by state schools in admissions. The referendum passed 58% to 42%, and was added to the Michigan constitution. 

**Current Case**

All this set the stage for the immediate case. Proponents of affirmative action argued that moving the ability to implement affirmative action programs violated the *Seattle School District* political process test as it moves the decisionmaking authority of a program that inures primarily to the benefit of a minority from the University of Michigan's Board of Directors to the Michigan constitution. This prevents minorities from even being a part of the conversation when it comes to laws that affect them the most. 

Opponents of the change argue that this is simply the political process at work. Democracy requires a majority opinion, and that opinion was heard in the form of a referendum to change the Michigan constitution. Additionally the ban prohibits all racially motivated factors from the admissions process, thus permitting a level playing field for everyone regardless of race.

The breakdown and outcome of the immediate case is as follows:

* 6 Justices voted that the affirmative action amendment, for various reasons, is valid. So the amendment stands, and for practical purposes, Michigan will remain a state that bans racial factors from admission to its public schools. 

* For legal purposes going forward, only three justices (Kennedy, Alito, and Roberts) felt that the political process test is a valid test, but that the facts of this case do not meet the standard professed in *Hunter* and *Seattle School District.* Essentially they say that the political process isn't rigged in this case, but it could be if the facts were different.

* Two justices (Scalia and Thomas) feel the political process test is improper for any set of facts and that *Hunter* and *Seattle School District* should be overruled. They state that democracy determines what is proper activity and what is not, and that so long as there is no intent to discriminate, the people in a particular area are allowed to relegate power to various levels of government at any time for any reason.

* The last justice that voted in favor of the amendment, Breyer, felt that the political process test simply did not apply to this case for very fact specific reasons that aren't important here.

So what does that mean for jurisprudence going forward? A few important points:

* The political process test is still alive and kicking. It can still be used to invalidate laws under Equal Protection.

* Affirmative action plans are still allowed generally. This case did nothing to overrule *Grutter,* and schools may still use race as a factor in admissions (so long as it doesn't violate state law; see below).

* A state may prohibit affirmative action by amending its constitution to prohibit all racial factors in the admissions processes of its state schools. The ruling is no more broad than this, it simply affirms that Michigan's new amendment followed all proper procedures and that its existence does not violate Equal Protection.

&gt; In the wake of Grutter, some voters in Michigan set out to eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies. Those voters were of course free to pursue this end in anynumber of ways. For example, they could have persuaded existing board members to change their minds through individual or grassroots lobbying efforts, or through general public awareness campaigns. Or they could have mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out of office, replacing them with members who would share their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies.  When this Court holds that the Constitution permits a particular policy, nothing prevents a majority of a States voters from choosing not to adopt that policy. Our system of government encouragesand indeed, depends onthat type of democratic action.

&gt; But instead, the majority of Michigan voters changed the rules in the middle of the game, reconfiguring the existing political process in Michigan in a manner that burdened racial minorities. They did so in the 2006 election by amending the Michigan Constitution to enact Art.I, §26, which provides in relevant part that Michigans public universities shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin inthe operation of public employment, public education, orpublic contracting.

I fail to follow Sotomayor's logic.  I'd appreciate it if someone could explain it to me.  Sotomayor enumerates a list of democratic actions the people of Michigan could take to change affirmative action in the state of Michigan.  She is fine with those actions but not OK with the public changing the Michigan Constitution by popular vote.  How is that not democratic?  Why are those voters not ""free to pursue"" that action?

&gt; A student seeking to have her family's alumni connections considered in her application to one of Michigan's esteemed public universities could do one of four things to have the school adopt a legacy-conscious admissions policy: she could lobby the admissions committee, she could petition the leadership of the university, she could seek to influence the school's governing board, or, as a measure of last resort, she could initiate a statewide campaign to alter the state's constitution. The same cannot be said for a black student seeking the adoption of a constitutionally permissible race-conscious admissions policy. That student could do only one thing to effect change: she could attempt to amend the Michigan Constitutiona lengthy, expensive, and arduous processto repeal the consequences of Proposal 2. The existence of such a comparative structural burden undermines the Equal Protection Clause's guarantee that all citizens ought to have equal access to the tools of political change.

The general theory, therefore, is that it is not enacting laws by referendum (popular vote) that is undemocratic; rather, it is using the referendum process to *entrench* a particular policymaking it difficult for future generations of minorities to change itthat is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

Imagine, for example, that the voters of a particular state said to themselves, ""we can see the politics of our state are gradually changing with an influx of young immigrants.  We'd rather this not happen.""  In response, they begin to entrench many of their current policies by making it more difficult to change those policies through normal democratic processes.  For example, they pass a state constitutional amendment saying: for any laws affecting the use of the death penalty, the legislature must pass those laws by a super majority (60%) vote, rather than a simple majority.

Constitutional amendments can, for this very reason, be very pernicious; they can entrench particular policies, thus making it difficult for future generations to change them without engaging in the difficult and expensive process of amending the constitution in return.

Now, this is not inherently a bad thing, and is not normally a violation of the U.S. Constitution.  But the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was designed to prevent Southern States from using legal process to discriminate against minorities, called into question state constitutional amendments that seemed to place special burdens on minorities.

This opinion, however, wrote that possibility out of the Equal Protection jurisprudence.

It is worth noting that statistical research (I'll edit this comment to add a link when I find it) has shown that 4 out of every 5 state referenda enacting constitutional amendments that address minorities' rights *have a negative effect* on those rightse.g. they take rights away or place additional burdens on minorities.  Much scholarship has been devoted to the phenomenon of circumventing traditional political processes to enact discriminatory policies.

This line of reasoning only true if you assume people always vote for/enact laws that is to their benefit:  all white people are always against affirmative action and all minorities are always for it.  This is clearly not the case, in the US we have plenty of people who vote for what they believe is right and not necessarily for their direct benefit: we have people living in rich northern states, which receive less benefits than they pay in taxes wanting *more* government and poor southern states which receive a net tax benefit wanting *less* government.

White privilege, is a huge and sticky thing. How many non-whites do you think would have gotten into college in the 1950s and 70s? 

&gt; But, I had better grades, I had better scores, it should be a meritocracy, the best grades gets in.

Except of course you did, you went to the best schools, with the most funding and the best teachers. All of which conveniently cost a shit ton of money, which comes from wealthy affluent (typically white dominated) neighborhoods. 

To spin it around, would it be fair to put a under-funded standard public education against a private school with dedicated tutors in a contest? 

Of course not, as it isn't a fair comparison. Why then are minorities (typically) from poor rural or urban areas who often have to work in addition to going to school, forced to compete with private, gated super-wealthy communities who can afford to study all the time and have dedicated tutors for college entrance?

That, is the white privilege that is being guarded against by these programs, that Whites have had, and continue to, have a institutional power that benefits them, and not other races. 

It's based on the idea that the nation/society does better by having a healthy and equal standing for all races. (The whole idea goes to shit if ~~you think that we should have mostly whites in charge, so there's that~~ happen to be a racist)

Case in point: when the Univ of California system got rid of AA, the percentage of Asians went up dramatically, not whites. It's around 46% at a school like Berkeley now (the top school in the system) now that it's based on a meritocratic system.

Likewise, if you look at any of the Ivy League schools, the percentage of Asians matriculating has conveniently stood at around 17% for the last 25-30 years consistently. Coincidence?  I doubt it.

Students who are minorities may not. They argued that this was unfair because it strips a certain group (minorities) of their right to explain who they are while maintaining that right for less needy groups. 

The problem with this is that any interesting story you can tell about your minority status can necessarily be told without including the words ""I'm black"" or ""I'm hispanic"" or I'm white."" If you grew up poor and needy, and had to take care of three siblings while putting yourself through school, that's really interesting and says a lot about your character regardless of whether you're black or white. If you were discriminated against because of your race and had to overcome a system stacked against you, that's interesting regardless of whether you happened to be born this or that color. The only reason you would need to say the specific race you happen to be a part of is if you want the admissions people to be able to tick a box in their heads that says ""ok, we got enough of X group this year."" That is the most base form of racial discrimination, and it's a good thing that the Supreme Court permitted states to ban it. 

That being said, I know some extremely smart, empathetic people who have thought a lot about this issue and come out the other way. It's a hard question. Ultimately I think the only fix here is to improve primary education in needy places as opposed to lowering the bar for minorities to get into college, and then leave them to compete with people who are far better prepared for the college experience.

Imagine the year is 1965. The Civil Rights Act was *just* passed. The elite institutions like Ivy League are almost entirely white, and ""historically black colleges"" are still 99.9% black and their quality of education is horribly substandard. The nation isn't governed by the graduates of these low-end black colleges (which at the time were far worse than the cheapest, small-town community college you can imagine). It was literally not *possible* for most African-Americans to significantly change their circumstances even though legally no one could stop them from doing so.

Even if the elite institutions practice race-blind admissions, even if all preexisting racial attitudes could be magically erased, it would **still** have been almost impossible for a black high school student in America to achieve the grades and test scores needed to gain admission into a good school in competition with wealthy white students who have private tutors, attend top private schools in the country, etc. True, that's an economic disparity and not an inherently racial one - the economic disparity might still exist today *but back then there were no minorities with access to those opportunities* so it laid strictly along racial lines. Like the old saying goes ""It takes three generations to truly get out of poverty,"" and that was the literal truth for African-Americans in the 60's. 

This was the rationale for affirmative action when it was introduced, and at the time it was probably a good one. It was literally true that a black person had to work at least twice as hard as a white person to get just as far, so in the face of a society that was at its core still very racist, it forced institutions to take into account how much more difficult it was for non-white students to overcome the disadvantages placed upon them. Without it, white colleges would probably still be white and black colleges would still be black. You have to take this into account because from our perspective now, growing up and living in a *very* different society, it seems unnecessary.

Whether affirmative action is still necessary today is a very different question from whether or not it was ever necessary. Laws are very slow to change and the people on the Supreme Court for the most part can remember it very well, which is why it's taken them this long to rule on whether or not it's time to set affirmative action aside. However, I think the majority of the SCOTUS is right here in that it's no longer necessary at a federal level and states should be able to choose to end it if they wish. ","7_6"

The reason they went with this policy is that education has the strongest correlation to success. People with higher levels of education consistently have less drug problems, better family lives, better incomes, better retirements, health, happiness, you name it. The mechanics of that aren't fully fleshed out but from a statistics point of view, getting people educated is the most effective way to deal with social problems. 

The catch-22 is that we see that serious social problems are correlated with people not getting a good education and hispanic and black Americans consistently have lower higher education enrollment.

That doctrine looks something like this: A state passes a law which looks something like this: ""All housing laws regarding race must be passed by 2/3 majority, whereas all other housing laws can be passed by simple majority."" The logic underlying this doctrine is that states can't make it harder for certain minorities to pass laws which benefit them. This is a form of equal protection violation.

BAMN's argument, which J. Sotomayor agreed with, is that this is what Michigan's Constitutional Amendment did. Thus, when she talks about ""erecting selective barriers..."" she's talking about removing laws which benefit certain minorities from the political process. 

It's a really, really, really complicated doctrine and it's tough to explain it to anyone without a fairly extensive understanding of 14th Amendment law. So, sorry if I've been less than clear.

The thing is, it's difficult for those schools to be competitive and successful.  First, towns like Cairo are still subjected to racism; see Jay Nixon's response to the notion of flooding MO farmland to protect Cairo.

While schools get federal funding, their funding is based on property values.  So, if your town is already poor, the school isn't going to get as much money.  The only way around this, really, is to have dishonest administrators and school board, or to have someone in your district, say, put up a bunch of low-income housing (yes, really.)  That last has gotten my wife's school through the current budget crisis so far.  The little town I came from, when I was a kid, they collectively refused low-income housing, purely because racial discrimination wasn't allowed in government housing.  They'd have to let the nigras live there!  O noes!

And do the kids actually give a shit?  Do they have abusive/indifferent parents?  Do they just think there's no reason to go to school?  The standardized tests will probably reflect that.  The way the current clusterfuck works, if standardized testing shows that your students are doing poorly, your funding goes down.  If it goes down enough, or if you don't show enough improvement, the school could get shut down.  The Cairo schools would be closed if it weren't for the fact that there aren't any schools within 50 miles that are enough better to take them.

The most infuriating thing about basing it almost solely on property value is that property values are no guarantee that a district will perform.  Cairo doesn't meet the standards.  Know who else doesn't meet the standards?  Barrington High School, a school in one of the most affluent districts in Illinois.  Now, they're *way* higher, and truthfully there seems to be a pretty consistent property-value-to-ACT-score ratio, but Barrington, despite having an indoor pool and a football coach that makes state university-level pay, doesn't meet federal standards.  (Cairo, by contrast, has buildings that should, by rights, be condemned.)

And at these crappy districts, you end up with teachers that might be thick-skinned, but maybe not such great teachers.  But the thing is, how do you attract talent if you can't pay them?  There are only so many people who are altruistic enough to give up the money.  And of course, if you're that kid from the 'burbs who's decided to change the world, and you take a job at Cairo, they have severe behavior problems.

Affirmative action doesn't say that some people are worth more or less than others. It acknowledges that there are cultural inconsistencies in this country.

Let's put this into video game world for a bit. Let's say that for some reason rural and suburban areas couldn't play a video game as well as others. People in dense urban areas had clear advantages over them.

As such, those people in dense urban areas got to level 100 in 5 years of gameplay, and those in suburban &amp; rural areas were stuck at level 5. The game was based on PvP interaction - so the level 100s are able to easily dominate the level 5's. There's nothing the 5's can do, they can never beat a level 100. The math itself precludes that possibility.

After 5 years, some rules are switched around, eliminating the artificial advantages. But there's still a clear problem. While it's possible for the 5's to level, they're still lagging and being clearly dominated by less skilled, but just higher level players.

You wait a while and see if it's changed at all. After 2 more years, some level 5's were able to break free and get up to a level that's as high as those with the previous advantage. But the vast majority are still stuck around level 5-10. And the level 100's are still between 110 and 120.

-----------

So you change the rules a bit. Having a severely low level doesn't hinder you as much anymore. You get artificial advantages that give the disadvantaged players with the most natural skill the ability to quickly gain levels (hopefully then turning around and helping out their comrades that are still stuck).

Does this mean that you built a system that says those with the previous advantage are 'worse' or 'better' than those without? Or is it just inserting an artificial crutch for those who were previously artificially disadvantaged.

----------------

The analogy is pretty simple, but to spell it out... When slavery ended, blacks found themselves in abject poverty and in a climate of deeply entrenched racism. The white people simply had more money. They also had a purely cultural advantage of not being directly discriminated against for no other reason than racial biases. Whites in the US had an artificial advantage over blacks for several generations.

After slavery, Jim Crow laws imposed even more artificial disadvantages for another 100 years.

--------------

As for my personal feelings, I think basing anything on purely cultural or racial lines is absolute the wrong way to go. As a stop-gap the first answer is to give advantages to people based purely on wealth. If you exchange 'black' for 'poor', you still hit a huge demographic of black people, but your overall goal of helping those with monetary disadvantages is preserved. In fact, it's even better than it would be had you based it purely on race.

It's helping raise up children who's parents simply couldn't afford to live in districts with good schools, who simply couldn't afford to pay for tutoring, who couldn't afford to stay home and help their children with homework, who can't afford college education. This is your goal. Not helping blacks or putting whites at a disadvantage.

My family was rather poor. I took the PSAT's 2-3 times, and on one, just for grins &amp; giggles I put down that I was African American. You'd be shocked at the number of scholarships I was offered. If I had been black, I would have had my pick of schools and college would have been 100% paid for. Nothing came to me when I put 'white'. I got to apply for loans like the rest of the melanin deficient. Why is this? Why do this based on race? If the goal is to give an advantage to the disadvantaged, the do that.

----------------

For an overall, long-term solution however, I think the answer to the problem is not affirmative action. Like many other issues, I see the answer in education.

We need to fundamentally change the way we educate our children. And we need to accept that society is simply better off with a more educated population, and provide college education to all high school graduates. And, much like our migration policies, have a set number of paid-for degrees based on the current regional needs (aka publicly-provided medical Doctor education where doctors are needed, publicly-provided welder education where welders are needed, etc).

This would allow for the wealthy to keep giving their children the advantages that wealth allows for, but also removes that financial barrier from the minds of the poor.

To further eliminate cultural biases, I'd also like to figure out a way that your name &amp; demographics don't have to be (or can't be) part of your resume or application for employment or college. Studies show that name biases run very deep in our culture - it's just another unfair burden that people shouldn't have to bear.","12_2"

If you have to work harder to achieve the same goal as someone equal to you, it is not putting disadvantages on a better person or trying to compensate for someone's personal deficiencies, it's compensating for unequal conditions that disadvantaged someone.

In the case of school acceptance: It may appear you are helping a lesser candidate, but they are trying to reward people who may show a similar level of merit in spite of coming from a lesser social situation.

So, being poor and overcoming that to make good grades, do interesting extracurriculars, work a job, etc., supports your application. All of these things are balanced against each other to form a balanced class. I think your statement is based on a misunderstanding of the way affirmative action operates in college admissions. In effect, it likely would not harm you in any measurable way.

Sorry, but if there were a college club for all whites, that would be considered racist.  Just like how many whites view black only clubs to be racist.  She was in a super minority club that did not allow whites or blacks in it.

Let's not forget the whole fire department none sense she was a part of before getting onto the court.

BUT I do agree with her that it is also silly to give people a bump because they are legacies.

That being said...  I think that when you apply for college, you should be given an ID number online from an agency used by all colleges.  Your transcript should not have your name, but this ID number after you get it.  You are not Josh.  You are not Tyrone.  You are not Phuk.  You are not Rishnad.  You are 123456789.  The what race are you should also be taken off of the application.  There you go.  No college can ever discriminate against you for what you are ever again.  They have no way of knowing if you are a white male.  After you are accepted, they can have all of your personal information that identifies you.","16"

There is a reason around 70% of Asians and Jews voted for Obama; despite all the things that ""should"" make Asians and Jews Republicans, many are still really wary about racism and persecution (and we acknowledge science). 


At the same time, I think most Asians are against racial affirmative action. As an Asian, it scares me when people argue that our schools should reflect the population because Asians are by far the most over-represented race in schools. In CA and Michigan, when racial affirmative action was banned, the White % stayed the same or decreased. The Asian % increased. As the only over-represented group in CA schools, racial affirmative action MUST decrease the % of Asians (BTW, the low income % of students increased drastically compared to other top schools since banning racial preferences). Saying that racial affirmative action would not really hurt Asians because we are over-represented is like saying that making all sports teams reflect the general population would not be detrimental to blacks because they are over-represented. For all of Sotomayor's talk about confronting the ""stark reality of race,"" I noticed that she did not mention Asians, the only racial group who would see their admittance to schools decrease. 


I already support socioeconomic affirmative action because I have been convinced that money is highly correlated with the metrics used in school admissions. If you want Asians to support racial affirmative action, a good first step would be to acknowledge that it will hurt them. I can understand why a black, latino, white, or asian person from the ghetto needs affirmative action. I cannot understand why my black neighbor taking the same test prep courses I am needs it. If racial diversity, in and of itself, is the value to be gained, racial affirmative action should be applied to all university groups, including sports. If the only value Asians gain from racial affirmative action is increased exposure to Blacks and Latinos, I'm sure Blacks and Whites on the bball team would benefit from being teammates with a few Asians.

Right now we have affirmative action, race quotas, gender quotas, a very skewed ratio of scholarship opportunities for minorities in general, community programs that aren't found in rural and suburban ""white"" America, decades of attention from psychologists, sociologists, pubic officials, educators, etc.; we have race-specific advocacy groups, race-specific television channels, race-specific magazines...

We put more police in the ghettos to confront the crime there and the police -- many of whom are now non-white themselves -- are called racist. We take them away, and suddenly the city is accused of abandoning the ghetto to crime. Universities lower their standards to give minorities (except non-white Asians, who seem to do a great job on their own) a greater chance of acceptance. Companies and government agencies spend valuable time and money paying people to attend inane racial sensitivity meetings which ultimately achieve nothing.

Race as a concept is holding everyone back from cultural progress, unification and stability, because as long as it's discussed as something legitimate it will deflect any attempt at achieving real solutions. As long as race is something with which people identify, people will associate others by race. And, as long as value is placed in one's race in effort to counter racial discrimination (i.e., pride vs. belittlement), then negative cultural behaviors will continue to be defended as valuable and as such people will continue to associate those behaviors with particular racial groups (hip-hop culture, tackiness, misogyny, ignorance, violence, etc.).

The reason this is seemingly so hard for large sections of black America to overcome lies in the historical bases of the majority and minority cultures. To adopt a culture which functions and produces the same effects as the majority culture, the immediate conclusion is that the minority culture has to adopt the majority culture's values and practices. These are generally European in origin. Europe appears to be doing pretty well for itself compared to much of the world. It becomes, however, another reminder of falling behind, of subjugation, of the feeling of inadequacy. Africa offers few historical and current cultural attributes to assume if the goal is to join the majority culture (let's face it, much of Africa is a shit hole, like the worst ghettos of America but without a police force). It's the feeling of not being good enough.

What everyone fails to recognize is that most Europeans who immigrated here were of lower classes, had dissimilar backgrounds and cultural attributes reflective of much of Europe even today. But, through assimilation and exchange, we now have the EU and that 'devil' and ineptly-named ""white America"" -- dissimilar people who may now coordinate activities, build stability and wealth, maintain higher standards of living and occasionally provide assistance to the rest of the world who has yet to figure enough of it out to achieve the same. Nobody has an authentic cultural identity anymore. Abandoning the desire to retain a dysfunctional one is the first step to overcoming history.

If race is independently meaningful, then it is an indicator itself and black people are inherently incapable of high-functioning societies. History and present global examples here and abroad, generalized, would be the evidence for this. Obviously, race isn't meaningful, as black people have demonstrated they are capable of anything and many white people act like monkeys.

If wealth is independently meaningful, then it is an indicator in itself and poor people are inherently incapable of participating in high-functioning societies. Again, obviously many poor people contribute immensely to the continued progression of knowledge and the enrichment of culture, while many wealthy people contribute nothing, so this isn't true per this discussion either.

Culture -- what a people consider meaningful and desirable, that which bonds them -- and its products creating both coordinated and independent actions of inspired individuals sharing at least some important cultural values and practices are the true indicators, for without such positive attributes nothing of value is produced or maintained regardless of race, gender or wealth; and, with such positive attributes creativity, discovery and stability abound regardless of race, gender or wealth. Indeed, it often leads to economically elevated egalitarianism within social institutions where some degree of assimilation is necessary -- like the military, or a field in the sciences, or among relatively homogenous populations (e.g., Scandinavian countries).

**tl;dr:** This is a good thing for everyone in a deep and meaningful way.

&gt; As a result of §26, there are now two very different processes through which a Michigan citizen is permitted to influence the admissions policies of the States universities: one for persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies and one for everyone else. A citizen who is a University of Michigan alumnus, for instance, can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicants legacy status by meeting individually with members of the Board of Regents to convince them of her views, by joining with other legacy parents to lobby the Board, or by voting for and supporting Board candidates who share her position. The same options are available to a citizen who wants the Board to adopt admissions policies that consider athleticism, geography, area of study, and so on. The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considers race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity. For that policy alone, the citizens of Michigan must undertake the daunting task of amending the State Constitution.

OK, makes sense.  Those who argued against *race-sensitive admissions* went through *the daunting task of amending the State Constitution* so undoing that would require the same effort.

&gt; Our precedents do not permit political restructurings that create one process for racial minorities and a separate, less burdensome process for everyone else. This Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment does not tolerate a political structure that treats all individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes insuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.

Here is where her logic unravels: she is making the explicit claim of *persons interested in race-sensitive admissions policies* are *all* members of a minority.  Plenty of white people in Michigan are for affirmative action and the Michigan constitution's ban applies to them as well.  No matter who you are, if you want Universities in Michigan to discriminate in favor of minorities, you have to change the Michigan constitution first.","46"

In the Harvard case, the invidious discrimination was alleged because there was clear statistical evidence that Asian Americans specifically were penalized based upon race.  

In both cases, however, the plaintiffs are arguing that the university is fundamentally using race as a dominant factor in a mechanical manner and using statistics to try to prove it.

The record evidence demonstrates that Harvard's race-based admissions process significantly disadvantages Asian-American applicants compared to applicants of other racial groups  including both white applicants and applicants from other racial minority groups, the DOJ said in court papers filed Thursday.

The move comes a year after Sessions announced internally that the DOJ would work to demolish affirmative action, calling it intentional race-based discrimination. The DOJ had been signaling for months that it might side with the anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions in the Harvard suit, brought four years ago.

The evidence, moreover, shows that Harvard provides no meaningful criteria to cabin its use of race; uses a vague personal rating that harms Asian-American applicants chances for admission and may be infected with racial bias; engages in unlawful racial balancing; and has never seriously considered race-neutral alternatives in its more than 45 years of using race to make admissions decisions, the DOJ wrote in its filing, which is signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General John M. Gore.

As part of a statement of interest, the DOJ wrote that it would oppose Harvards request to dismiss the lawsuit before it goes to trial on October 15 in Boston.

Harvard, whose student body is 22.2 percent Asian-American, has repeatedly denied that there are any discriminatory policies against Asian-Americans. In a statement responding to the DOJ's move Thursday, the school said:
ADVERTISING



We are deeply disappointed that the Department of Justice has taken the side of...Students for Fair Admissions, recycling the same misleading and hollow arguments that prove nothing more than the emptiness of the case against Harvard. This decision is not surprising given the highly irregular investigation the DOJ has engaged in thus far, and its recent action to repeal Obama-era guidelines on the consideration of race in admissions"" in July.

And the American Civil Liberties Union said the move by the DOJ was an attempt to dismantle progress in racial equity.

While the DOJs brief does not challenge Supreme Court precedent granting universities the right to freely select their own student body  presumably because it cannot do so at this stage of the litigation  the Trump administration has advocated for race-blind policies, which Harvard and virtually all other universities have found are demonstrably insufficient to achieve meaningful diversity, given the reality of historic and continuing racial discrimination in this country, the ACLU wrote in a statement.

However, DOJ lawyers cited Harvards federal funding as justification for its involvement in the suit, arguing that the DOJ must work to make sure that American tax dollars do not serve to finance the evil of private prejudice.

No American should be denied admission to school because of their race, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a written statement. As a recipient of taxpayer dollars, Harvard has a responsibility to conduct its admissions policy without racial discrimination by using meaningful admissions criteria that meet lawful requirements.","1"

You are confounding two issues as if they were one. Filial piety is about duty to one's parents, it is NOT about blindly obeying one's parents. 
The easiest way is to look at the Historic Treaty The Commentary of Zuo. 
http://www2.iath.virginia.edu:8080/exist/cocoon/xwomen/texts/chunqiu/d2.7/1/0/bilingual

Part 3. 

This is the story between the struggle with the Duke Zhuang of Zheng, his brother Duan, and his mother. Here the mother loved the younger brother Duan, and wanted him to have more territory, so Duke Zhuang gave in and allowed his younger brother to obtain more territory, causing him to have more ambition eventually until they came to armed conflict (and I am skipping a lot of the details) which resulted in the exile of Duan and the imprisonment and eventual release of his mother. 

One point to make was the discussion between Duke Zhuang and his subordinate who begged him that giving your mother what she wanted is not the right course of action, because she would only want more and her desire is limitless, to which Duke Zhuang replied 'It was our mother's wish.' 

In the commentary however, Master Zuo wrote '""The earl of Zheng overcame Duan in Yan,"" demoting Duke Zheng for his failure to be properly filial, that is, to act like a brother and a son, and to stand up to his mother. 

This is in fact, a comment on BOTH filial piety and leadership. ","1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

I get it, but this isn't how some Asian parents see it. Many of my friends were beaten as children for disobeying their parents over (in my opinion) minor issues, and two weren't beaten but were disowned.

The people who brought the 2003 suit were White. I strongly suspect that the 2006 vote was a bit divided on race as well.

&gt; Interestingly, there are state colleges that have increased diversity after affirmative action bans (like Texas A&amp;M and UF). 

I'm not sure if their 'increases' were within the range that might be explained by statistical noise, but still, that's a hopeful sign that there may be steps that can be taken. As a side note, Texas reinstated affirmative action in 2005.","2_1_1"

For instance, clawing your way through a shitty neighborhood and subpar schools shows just as much diligence as a perfect test score. Even more so if they helped take care of younger siblings. That shows me that they follow through, they take their responsibilities seriously and they know how to juggle different priorities. Much more so than a kid who just had to show up with the homework a tutor walked him/her through.


Also, the country is becoming more diverse, and people who are used to collaborating with diverse groups are going to be more successful. So it's not a PC thing to have a representative group of minorities. It's providing the best education possible to a student and equipping them for success.


One thing to note, though, is the fact that competitive schools are admitting competitive students. A black kid at an elite school is not getting in without stellar grades, achievements and references. I remember when that girl sued UT when she didn't get in, saying that she was discriminated against because she was white. Well, among the many items that UT used to counter her argument was the fact that there were there a lot of black students with even better grades/scores than her that *also* didn't get in.

This minority group was not to blame for any of the problems in Germany at that time, but by targeting them as the enemy, the political party began to gain power. Some people were unhappy and the idea of being able to blame one group for everything that was wrong was appealing. Others thought it was wrong, but since they weren't part of that targeted group, they said nothing. As this political party gained power in the government, more and more rights were taken away from this targeted group. 

Then the next group was targeted. It wasn't just Jewish people who were evil and ruining Germany, it was immigrants, too. And homosexuals. The political party gradually started targeting every minority group they could. And since those groups were minorities, the majority of people weren't affected, so they stood by and let it happen. And when they were the next ones targeted, no one stood up for them either. 

Eventually, the political party became the only one, and speaking out against it became illegal. Free speech and freedom of expression was severely limited. The only accepted religion was Christianity. The press was heavily controlled and the news outlets not affiliated with the party were shut down. If you weren't a part of the group considered ""pure,"" you were persecuted.

With me so far?

Now, let's look at what the Republican party has been doing. Targeting one minority group as a scapegoat that is in no way responsible for the problems in America? Check. See the anti-trans hate, for starters. See gay weddings ruining traditional family values. As if gay marriage takes anything away from straight marriage.

Targeting multiple minority groups? Check. See all the hatred around ""identity politics."" See affirmative action being undone, which has historically been used to equalize unequal opportunities for racial and other minorities. See gay rights being threatened. See anti-Semetic sentiments. See immigrants being blamed for many problems, to the point that we should kick them all out and build a border wall to keep them out for good. See the systemic racism against non-white people that has existed for centuries in America. It's a lot of the same groups that other party hated, how interesting.

Only accepted religion is Christianity? We're getting there. Many recent laws come from a place of Christian ideals. See abortion rights being taken away because Christians see it as a sin. Once one religion gets other people's rights taken away in the name of their religion, that's no longer religious freedom.

Freedom of speech and expression being limited? Again, we're getting there. A person in Florida is not allowed to express themselves through clothing if that clothing doesn't fit very specific rules, for example. I'm glad things aren't so extreme that I can still safely say the Republican platform is a pile of hateful shit. A certain social media platform has been horrendous in how it limits free speech, and this platform was often used for activism (ie, anti-fascism) in the past. Now many of those voices are silenced.

Freedom of the press? Let's see. There's one news network I can think of where facts are ignored if they don't uphold the beliefs the network is trying to propagate. This network likes to villify anyone not affiliated with the party they support and is quite open in their hatred. Any chance they get to spread hate and blame on the minority groups mentioned, they take. At the moment, it's this one network that is a problem. But I remember a certain former president, and lots of people online, saying that all the other news outlets should be shut down except for this one. Accusing those other news outlets of spreading misinformation. Fake news.

The one ""pure"" group? We're not there yet, thankfully. Although there are certainly people who automatically hate anyone not white, anyone not straight or cis, anyone not Christian, anyone not born in the United States, and these people are the ones who mark R on their ballot every time. Interesting coincidence.

So I hope that answers your question of how Republicans are anywhere close to fascism. Fascism got started in 1920s and 30s Germany with very similar patterns to what we are seeing now. To ignore or deny these patterns, knowing what they lead to, is simply foolish.","8_1_1_1_3_1_1"

They grow up to become problems in American society. 
If minor the person who grew up without a loving parent will turn to addiction for comfort and escape from their rage and pain. 
On the severe end the child grows up to be a predator. Hunting random people to vent their rage, pain and misery on any person who is available. Most serial killers were unwanted as children. 
I believe that anti abortion activists are well meaning but they saving no one. 
The Bible does not say that abortion is murder. The Bible does not even tell us that abortion is a sin. 
Being aware that Republicans were not fighting to make abortion illegal to save the lives of babies, I researched the reason for the Republican party choosing to be so agressive in stopping abortion. The true motivation for Republicans enacting laws prohibiting abortion is ugly.
They want to keep the birthrate high to ensure that the future will have more people needing jobs than jobs needing people. Although, I read this repeatedly, I had trouble believing it. 
Then I heard several Republican candidates state this reason outright. They said that we want to be certain that we go back to having so many people needing work that they will be desperate for a job and we can pay them less and won't be in a position of having to give employees so many rights and pay top dollar. We have to keep the birthrate high to protect our shareholders and our corporate profits. Gross in my opinion.","53"

Gorsuch's majority opinion in Bostock was joined in full by all the liberal justices - Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson all agree with Bostock. Gorsuch's concurrence still stands true, which is why the dissent never addressed Bostock or Title VI in the affirmative action case:
&gt;The principal dissent contends that this understanding of Title VI is contrary to precedent. Post, at 2627, n. 21 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). But the dissent does not dispute that everything said here about the meaning of Title VI tracks this Courts precedent in Bostock interpreting materially identical language in Title VII. That raises two questions: Do the dissenters think Bostock wrongly decided? Or do they read the same words in neighboring provisions of the same statuteenacted at the same time by the same Congressto mean different things?

I didn't expect you to cite Alito's dissent either because the crux of his argument was idiotic. He claimed that it isn't sex discrimination for an employer to fire a woman who was married to a woman while not firing a man married to a woman. His argument was that the employer would fire a man married to a man but not fire a woman married to a man, but that doesn't make these situations not ""sex discrimination"". It just means that there is sex discrimination on both sides. 

If Alito's argument were taken to its full value, it would not be race discrimination for an employer to fire an employee who is in an interracial marriage in an equal manner. As long as they treated their Black and White employees equally and fired any of them once they found out they were in an interracial marriage, then it wouldn't be race discrimination based on Alito's logic. 

Citing Alito for SCOTUS opinions is a bad idea. This is a guy who thought that the prosecution should be allowed to appeal an incorrect acquittal, that videos of animal violence are not protected by the 1st amendment, and that violent video games aren't protected by the 1st amendment. 

&gt;So what did the Title VII authors intend? Definitely not a whole cloth banning of benevolent racial classification for the purposes of creating a diverse elite or correcting historical discrimination.

And how exactly would that perverse interpretation work? Someone can pretend that they're using racial discrimination in a benevolent manner and it becomes ok. Could NBA teams use race as a factor in drafting players in order to increase diversity? Maybe the percentage of players who are African American falls from 73% to 50%. I absolutely think that would be racial discrimination and against the law. 

Even when a school initially, seemingly has a benevolent intention in using race in admissions, it is hard for the admissions officers to not become racists or to employ racial stereotypes in their admissions process. If you looked at all the transcripts from the Harvard and UNC admissions officers, there were some pretty awful stereotypes and racist comments made.","55_2_1_1_2"

No. Swastika aficionado is not a religion. Your example would have to be the other way: a Jewish guy wants the Nazi-iconographist to put a star of David on a cake.

&gt; If some religious guy doesn't want to put something gay on a cake he is baking for a customer, they should have every right to do so.

If they are not a business entity then they absolutely have the right to refuse to do that. Businesses do not have same rights as people. They have certain extra obligations and extra privileges. This gets sticky when you have single-person businesses. How do you separate the person from their obligations as a business?

When the first Supreme Court was established *by Congress in 1789*, they decided that the number of Justices would be six.

Congress also reserves the right to approve nominees, and to fire Justices through impeachment.

The last time a President tried to expand the court it was Franklin Roosevelt in 1937, and despite a lot of public relations pressure, Congress allowed the proposal to die without serious consideration.

While a President can't do it, Congress can and has changed the number of people on the court numerous times up until the Civil War.

&gt;He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law

Note that Congress has a role at every major point of it: in the creation of the courts, consent of nominees, and expansion and creation of additional offices (""which shall be established *by Law""*).

Congress owns all of it.  They directly create, destroy and oversee *all of it.*  They can even create courts that answer directly to Congress and don't even operate under Article III, such as the [US Court of Claims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Claims).

The President merely supplies the name of the nominee and as we have so tragically recently seen,  it's Congress that can ignore the nominee of the President, as happened at the end of President Obama's term.","4_1_1_2_1_1_4_1_2"

That wont happen as it has no support outside of progressives in the House and 3 whole votes in the senate. Furthermore, modern attempts to pack the court could end up facing separation of powers challenges IN the courts https://lawliberty.org/is-court-packing-constitutional/. 

So expecting this level of delusion and then being apathetic when it doesnt happen is a major reason why our turnout goes down in midterms.

Problem is this doesn't statistically hold true in the U.S. Here, chances the same odds are not stacked against them in the same equal way. The way the U.S. is set up, even if you take out the race component and make it purely economic, you come up with...still a race component. So, the way its also developed, if you look at these policies, is that race isn't a criterion but a consideration. Meaning it things like quotas aren't allowed, and generally aren't given enough weight as to be outcome determinative. It's also about qualitative judgement. The U.S. collegiate system as a whole doesn't function solely on academic performance. So if we take the criticism that it should only be about academic performances then query why legacy admissions are a thing, or sports scholarships for that matter. Take for example how about 43% of white students at Harvard are [legacy, athletics, or child of faculty admits](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/legacyathlete.pdf). Yet we don't see nearly as much criticism of that as picking unqualified candidate over qualified ones in the U.S.","59_1_1_1"

1. If the issue that's trying to be solve is diversity, it really doesn't matter if they're wealthy or not. I would put forth that what some of these programs are trying to do is fix the issue that there's a gap in college diversity that's along racial lines. There is already financial assistance programs available to poor white people and poor people in general. You're conflating admissions with financial assistance, which are not necessarily the same thing. Indeed, that statement also hinges on the assumption that ""well off black people"" benefit the most from affirmative action programs. Considering the wealth disparity in the United States, that's doubtful whether that's actually the case or a big enough problem to really tank the whole system on. After all, wouldn't the same be true for the ALDC programs at Harvard benefitting mostly white students?
2. Making it purely class based would work, if it weren't for the fact that class and race are inherently tied together in the U.S. Hence why ""socio-economic"" status is a thing. Socio e.g. place in society, and economic, class. We're talking intersectionalism, and honestly the best way to prove how this assumption is wrong through evidence. [See this article for example, which demonstrates how removal of affirmative action programs in California had a demonstrative effect in creating a gap in demographics.](https://edsource.org/2020/dropping-affirmative-action-had-huge-impact-on-californias-public-universities/642437) That article explains how the gap even held true in admissions despite a rise in high graduates of black and latino students, i.e. qualified students.  Making it class based isn't as easy a solution as it might appear because there's more than wealth at work when it comes to opportunity gaps.","59_1_1_1_1_1"

If they're inherently tied, then it should work fine. I don't see why we should exclude less fortunate people, and include other, more fortunate people, just based on race. If we target the economics, we solve the problem. If you go by race, you're just treating the symptom and ignoring the problem.","59_1_1_1_1_1_1"

They're not. There's no reason why we can't encourage both class-based and race-based considerations. We already have financial assistance programs in place, and financial viability is already a consideration in college admissions. I can agree with you even that those are insufficient and maybe the US should consider stronger federal aid policies, loan forgiveness, and potentially even free post-secondary education. We can do all those class-conscious things and still have equitable affirmative action programs.  Again, you're making it sound simple when its really not. Especially when we consider how absent those programs we see a very real opportunity gap develop in terms of admissions demographics.  The problem is the colorblind approach doesn't work. And we can get into why it doesn't work if you want, but it stands to reason based on that article I linked you, that stripping away affirmative action protections doesn't ""give everyone an equal fair shot."" In fact it seems quite the opposite because our society has systemic breaks when it comes to who gets opportunities in a status quo of no protections.","59_1_1_1_1_1_1_1"

Either you have a conflict of interest or you don't.  In this case, Mr. Thomas has a clear conflict of interest - those of being a fair and impartial Supreme Court Justice, and those of his wife.  It's not a ""potential"" conflict of interest. It *is* a conflict of interest.

I mean, if you pick a degree like law and you graduate from a tier 1 school like an ivy, your earnings potential is tens of thousands (or even hundreds of thousands) of dollars higher than someone graduating from a tier 2 or 3 law school.  A junior at a small law firm (which is about what a tier 2 degree will land you) could make 70-80k a year starting or more.  A graduate with a tier 1 degree from someplace like Yale Law who lands a job at a big law firm (where you pretty much need an ivy degree for them to even look at your resume) can expect to make well clear of 150k out of college.  I get the ivy hate circlejerk is strong in this thread but there are plenty of people from middle class families who are accepted.  Most of my friends in ivies or who are alumni came from middle class or lower and now basically have the world as their oyster what with the extensive alumni network and the merits of having an Ivy on your degree.

Granted, already low yield majors like English might not see the bang for the buck at and ivy, but if you pick something with a strong market you will see return on the degree.

Also, I just want to point out many of these legacy kids get into prep schools and colleges because while ideally you want to only admit kids on merit *someone* has to pay full price to pay the bills.  You can only dip into the endowment for so long.  Are there severe misallocations of funds in universities?  Definitely.  But ultimately you can't have an entire class of students only paying 10 percent of the price at a private institution otherwise expect to be shuttered or slashing budgets in a few years.","2_4_4"

""Just because you don't have to, doesn't mean you shouldn't"". You're now giving a justification to refuse all poor people with no explanation. 

&gt;Equity is not oppression.

But that's not equity. Demonstrably not so. You're punishing a person for being well off. You're creating two sets of standards for comparable groups based on factors out of their control. Should the well off guy have chosen to be poor? This isn't a situation where you're purely helping out the poor kid, if he gets in then the other kid doesn't. One person has to lose, you've just created a scenario in which you can feel good about yourself for the decision you've made on who has to lose. Whereas others use merit-based application, you'd basically punish the well off. And by doing so you say it'd acceptable to discriminate based on socio-economic class, which WILL be used against the poor.","2_6_1_2_2_1"

No, it does not mean that. What you are saying would only be true if input was directly equal to output or if everyone was equally efficient in converting input to output. In reality, neither of those things are true. Choosing someone on merit would mean choosing the person who most efficiently converted input to output.

That is cool and all, but you are also arguing against something entirely different from what I wrote.  To make it more clear, test scores and grades (i.e. output) do have some correlation with intelligence.  However, they also have a significant correlation with wealth (i.e. input like tutors, better teachers, being fed before school, having somewhere quiet to do your homework).  If schools want kids who are better able to learn, then it makes more sense for them to take a kid who did slightly worse with less resources, than it does to take a kid who did only slightly better with more resources.

You really should not use analogies if you do not want people to read into the implication of those analogies.  If I said someone was scurrying like a rat and meant that they were very energetic, I should not be surprised if they thought I was insulting them in some way.  Analogies imply similarity.  If you do not define and delimit the types of similarity you want read into your analogies, you should not be surprised if more is read into them than you expected.

No.  I am saying that we know one of the kids survived because he has a working immune system, whereas we do not really know if the other kid actually has a working immune system.  If the difference in health is not absurdly different, I would choose the kid whose immune system definitely works over the kid whose immune system might work.  And if I were to provide both of them with medicine going forward, I would expect the health of the kid who had relied on medicine his whole life to stay the same, whereas I would expect the health of the kid who never took any medicine to improve.  (I am sure you will find something wrong with my analogy after what I said about yours, but...)

No, no it isn't. On the merits of ""who is better able to achieve academically"" then the answer is still the kid with the higher GPA, since regardless of his circumstance he has still produced the greatest excellence of the 2 candidates. His resources don't magically disappear after acceptance either, so he will continue to excel past the other if you believe resources are the motivator.

&gt;success with in inflated inputs is not really success

It unequivocally, demonstrably is. Rich people aren't suddenly less rich if they have high input values, you're trying to conflate high barrier-for-entry with a dependent end-product.

&gt;If you are born on third base and pat yourself for hitting home runs you have little merit. In act you are blocking people with true talent

But your runs are not worth any less, when you need on run to win the game you don't take the player off third base because you think the batter has ""more character"", you ensure that third-base player can make a run. You're really bad at analogies.

&gt;See Donald

I don't know where everybody here got the impression Donald Trump isn't a successful individual on his own merit but his property empire hasn't vanished suddenly as a result of the presidency. His success is demonstrable.

&gt;If you do well when you are poor imagine how well you can do with the resources of Harvard behind you. 

You keep saying that poor people when put into successful universities turn out more successful than their affluent counterparts, [but the data simply does not support that statement since the gap between rich and poor for college completion has only widened](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17633.pdf). ""The resources of Harvard"" don't pay for room and board buddy.

&gt;Wealth will cover up your lack of talent

So will accepting those who lack talent to cover up for their inequality of income.

&gt;Tutors help cover your your lack of intelligence.

That's not how tutoring works. Tutors teach people things, help them understand things. Are you seriously trying to suggest that learning things hides that you lack knowledge? Because it was seem the way to become more intelligent would be to learn things, I guess you think intelligence is just a thing that happens, ey?

&gt; And later you are put in a position of power where wealth can't help you we all suffer. See donsld.

Fuck me you really love shitting on Trump when he was by far the favorite of the same low-income earners you're trying to champion.

&gt;Your last paragraph is unclear. It's very simple. Two guys. One offs rich with 3.8. The other poor with 3.7. The poor persons gpa is far more impressive he's probably smarter than the rich guy

No, 3.8 is a bigger number than 3.7. The bigger number is more impressive because it means he is smarter, he knows more things, he is more successful in academia than his counterpart. You really shouldn't be talking about education if you can't figure out that 8 is bigger than 7. How is he smarter than the rich guy if he, by objective measurement of his academic performance, was judged to have lower performance than the rich guy?  
I simply don't understand your backwards thought process. Do you think rich kids are born smart? That they come out of the womb with a 3.8 GPA? Do you think that 7 is bigger than 8, did you not listen in math class? If a rich man knows 10 things and a poor man knows 8 things, why is the poor man smarter? Do you expect poor people to be idiots, is that your process?

&gt;If he could do so much with so little imagine how much he could do with more resources. 

Less than his counterpart, because he isn't as smart as his counterpart. Because by objective measurement of academic performance he came out behind. Putting a Gorilla that knows sign language in a Library for 3 years won't produce an English Major. Resources don't suddenly make dumber people smarter than smarter people.

So your anecdotal tale of self-deprecation is now going to be taken as some sort of gospel about how the children of affluent families don't actually work hard?  
I came from a working class background buddy, was the first of my family to ever attend university. I ended Secondary School with a higher GPA than around half the wealthy kids, some of whom I tutored. I guarantee you those kids worked harder than I did. Math and English came naturally to me, it didn't however to them and since they were expected to be successes, they put plenty of their waking hours into trying to achieve what was expected of them. I never stayed back after school if I had the option not to: They actively chose to use libraries and computer labs during recess. If you want to go anecdotal, we can go much further than this.

&gt;Also: the successful former poor kid's kid will have other advantages, so it evens out.

So it's okay to discriminate against people in education if ""they have other advantages""? Maybe universities shouldn't accept my nephew since his father is a tradesman and he is pretty much guaranteed work if he chooses to go down that path, is that right? ","2_6_1_2_4_1_1_1"

&gt; A major factor in his success is Dubya's apparent mediocrity. The man is at best a lackadaisical administrator, a ""big picture"" guy who delegates all of the detail work to subordinates and only wants to be bothered with final yes-no decisions. He's a weak public speaker, underprepared for debates and press conferences, clearly uncomfortable citing specific facts, figures, and sometimes even proper names. The man also appears to be congenitally undignified, evidently incapable of going ten minutes without his trademark smirk or a full-blown shit-eating grin, regardless of the situation.

&gt; All of which combines to make him seem much dumber than most elected officials. Even many of his most ardent supporters presume that Dubya possesses an I.Q. bordering on 100. But -- counterintuitive as it may seem -- this idea is actually comforting to his political base. These are people who would like nothing more than to believe that the problems of governance are easily solvable, if only we can somehow avoid overthinking them. One of Bush's biographers put it this way:

&gt;&gt; ""There is a group of people who feel that '[the President of the United States should] be smarter than I am on just about every issue I can think of.' But there is also a large group of people who don't feel that way. They want the President, in this modern era, to be something they can relate to. Someone who they don't think is intellectually intimidating. Someone who isn't really lost in the big fog of intellectual ideas and the world of words."" 

&gt; Ultimately, these voters are working from a gut feeling. Their assumption is that all we really need to clean up the mess in Washington is somebody possessing the courage of his convictions, and a healthy appetite for some old-fashioned hard work. And although neither of those criteria actually applies to George W. Bush, he manages to fake them well enough. 

an analysis of his management style:

&gt;  This concept of the chief executive being the guy who gathers the brain trust whenever something goes haywire is illustrative of Bush's philosophy of government. It should be reactive, not active. Your typical liberal might respond with something like, ""I intend to hold daily meetings on the state of the economy, where we track exactly this kind of thing and take measures the minute they're needed."" But Bush believes that government should do as little as possible. It's supposed to handle major crises but otherwise stay out of everyone's hair.

&gt; That was pretty easy to do as governor. Running Texas isn't really a full-time job. When Bush kept bringing up his legislative successes as governor, we were supposed to be impressed. It's kind of anticlimactic when you learn that the Texas legislature only meets for 140 days, and even then they only hold a session every other year. Otherwise they're on hiatus. That really tends to lighten the workload. Governor Bush's typical workday included a two-hour afternoon break for napping, exercise, or playing video games.

Nope just the ones who meet the academic standards. Race should not be a factor.

&gt;It helps students who have lacked opportunity get the opportunities otherwise denied them :)

If a college wants to consider a students lack of oppurtunities they can. 

They still don't have to look at the person's skin color.

Racial discrimination on college admissions isn't morally justifiable.

I took a gap year, and would have applied to safety schools during that year had I not gotten into and deferred at one of my reach schools.  So, all eight schools I applied to were pretty similar in size, general feel, academic calibre, etc. One of the reach schools was the one my parents and one set of grandparents had gone to.  I didn't apply because of that, it just fit what I wanted well, and I actually strongly considered not applying just because they had gone there and I felt a bit weird about it.  

I kid you not, I get back the eight letters and they comprise: seven that said 'wait list' and one that said 'accepted.'

I bet none of you can guess which one accepted me.  (/s)

It wasn't that I wouldn't do okay at any of those schools, but I wasn't quite stand-out enough in all respects to get in at most of them right off the cuff - except for the legacy school.  I don't know what would have happened had I not been legacy, but I'd bet a lot it would be wait list there too.  Eight wait lists is decent odds to get into one, but I might have gone to a safety school also, and regardless my life would be totally different, for better or worse.  Weird to think about.  Anyways, this just rang really true.  White kids not having an edge getting into colleges is a tough argument for me to buy, and this is one part of it.  ","6"

-Colleges use ""Diversity"" as the reason to discriminate on race

-The WH is suggesting that the graduation rates of all races should be close or you are admitting people who aren't qualified to graduate just to make your race numbers look better.

The entire argument is that a diverse culture creates better students, if you want to discriminate on race basically you have to have a fairly defend-able argument, this argument is basically saying you either aren't equipped to handle the people you are bringing in/ you are ""using"" them for the benefit of the rest/ You are ""using"" them to benefit your race numbers. Depending on the variance between races graduation rate I'd honestly say it's a fairly robust legal argument.

IMHO there is no way an admission office has the capability to determine if someone race has played into their culture. If you really want ""diversity"" then you really shouldn't be excluding Asian Americans who are probably much more diverse culture than Multi Generational African Americans/Hispanics.

The household income is $72k / year gross.


That said, both kids are going to a state college starting this fall with a grand total of $4,500 out of my pocket for the first year. The rest came from scholarships, state money offered on good grades and money saved. The least of the money offered is from student loans through FAFSA (that $71k is to much). There is no legacy money what so ever. They went to a public school and we are not in a ""prosperous"" community.

Correct, but what Harvard wanted was not constitutional and it would not have been constitutional even if the shoe were on the other foot and Asians were getting preferential treatment over Blacks.  Using a blanket factor of race regardless of the individual's experiences does not ensure diversity except for a very cosmetic surface level way.  

The Supreme Court still allows for race to be used in your personal essays if it demonstratively impacted your personal identity.  It allows for a Nigerian immigrant growing up in a predominantly wealthy white suburb to tell their story of racial identity in contrast to a DOS telling their story growing up in an impoverished black and latino neighborhood.","2_1_2_1_1_1"

They used race as a factor.  Within the factor of race, they did not allow for tweaks of racial score between individuals.  In other words, all Black students were treated the same in scoring for race regardless of being mixed race like Obama, or a DOS, or immigrant, etc...  

&gt;The court just objected to the idea they could have been not selected due to race, not that these particular kids actually were.

Yes, the courts objected because the level in which race was used as a factor was so overwhelming at Harvard, it put [Asian Americans at the top decile of academic performance to the same level as Black students in the 4th decile in terms of admissions.](https://nypost.com/2023/06/29/supreme-court-affirmative-action-case-showed-astonishing-racial-gaps/)   Race can still be used today, post AA ban, as a factor in shaping your identity as a candidate, but it won't just automatically propel a rich black student who scores a 40% over a disadvantaged Asian scoring 100%.  

&gt;Cali, FL and other states have tried proxies for race, and minority representation at their schools have plummeted anyway. Just as the white supremacists wanted.

California was the first state to ban Affirmative Action in 1996 but is one of the most left leaning states in the nation.  In 2020, democratic politicians in the state attempted to bring back Affirmative Action through Prop 16.  California-associated politicians like Kamala Harris, Diane Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Governor Gavin Newsom, SF Mayor London Breed, and a whole slew of others.  Yet when it came down to the votes, Californians overwhelmingly rejected the unbanning of Affirmative Action with 56% voting against.  These are the same voters that voted in favor of Biden over Trump 63% to 34%.  

So are Californians actually white Supremacists that also happen to hate Trump and all Republicans?  Or is it possible that Californians believe that treating people differently on the basis of their race, ethnicity, or national origin is wrong?","2_1_2_1_1_1_1_1"

This is why, as you pointed out, they tried to bring it back in 2020.  Most Americans don't go to college, I don't expect most of them to understand what applying to elite colleges is like, and how race is actually used.

I point out white supremacists are happy, bc the libertarian white man who assembled the Asian plaintiffs used data compiled by a Holocaust denying man who hosts white supremacists on his academic journal.  So I did not mean Cali at all, but the man behind the Asian students.  

There is zero evidence these kids were not selected based on their race.  It is impossible to prove that for a variety of reasons: Harvard looks for people who are different in 1000 different ways.  Have you been tricked into thinking it's all rich black kids vs poor Asian students?  There simply is no data to back that up.  What is a racial score?  There was no tracking of a score related to race.  There was a personality score, but no race score.

40%?  What are you referring to?  Hold up, you think failing black students are getting into Harvard?????????   Every.  Single.  Kid.  Applying is top of their class, etc.  They are all qualified, with very, very few goofy exceptions.  Yup, ""even"" the black ones!

If grades and test scores aren't what Harvard is interested in, fine. It should make that clear and not label itself solely as an institution of higher learning. If its goals are about making political connections and producing elitist people, then prospective students need to know about it so they don't waste their time applying there and so they can focus on finding real colleges that value academic merit.","2_1_2_1_1_3_1_1_1_1"

So like, the kinds of people who come from an authoritarian model they were benefited by are siding with the authoritarians in power now who continue to benefit them.

Southeast Asians tend to be a bit different in voting style since we tend to be more socioeconomically disadvantaged, although there has always been a small contingent who tends to go for Republicans because of the anti-Communist bent (see my own South Vietnamese community who fled during the Vietnam war). Even then though a majority of us will still vote Democrat since we know how racist and terrible Republicans are. I know from some Filipino friends that the party you backs heavily depends on if you think Duterte/the new Marcos is a good or bad thing which again goes back to the ""were you an authoritarian and benefited by the system?"" 

Basically we've got a fair few rich Asian groups that are coming in and voting with the fascists because that's worked well for them in the past, but by and large a majority of Asians are still blue and we're still only 5.7% of the population to begin with so slight shifts in our margins are things to work on in the Democratic party but not nearly as big an issue as the majority white men and white women that are still going R even after Dobbs.","3_1_1_1_1"

The elephant in the room is that it suffers heavily from zero-sum thinking. I do think it is needed to level the playing field, but i have always had a sick feeling about it.

I put it in the same category as democracy. It's an awful system that happens to be the best we can come up with. Like democracy, it disenfranchises certain groups to maximize the overall benefit to society.

If i had to fix the problem that is ""solved"" by affirmative action, it would be to increase enrollment numbers and decrease the tuition costs of universities. Why should anybody who is capable be left out of the opportunity for the best education they can receive? I understand that resources are limited in the short term, but this policy has been in place for decades. Shouldn't we have been using that time to improve the status quo, rather that thinking the problem was solved?

My answer to every question is simply to increase access to quality education for everybody. That is the best investment we can make in almost every conceivable scenario.

Asking a general question about if respondents support black people, minorities, and women getting better access to higher education is disingenuous as by design it sidesteps the actual issue that is controversial.

This is not surprising, as the two activist groups that commissioned this survey overtly support race-based admissions.

When Asian-Americans are polled on if they support racial/ethnic considerations in admissions, they overwhelmingly oppose it.

Also, the same survey [asked Asian-Americans if they supported Prop 16](https://aapidata.com/infograpic-2020-ca-proposition-16-vote/), and they supported it 37% to 21%.

Yet during the actual election, the measure failed by nearly 15 points when it was on the same ballot as a presidential election which saw the state of California have over 70% participation, which was the highest turnout in 68 years.

So it is important to understand context of the sources you cite.

For one, this survey was conducted by organizations that have a vested interest in a particular result so the questions are going to be tailored to get the desired result (AKA not asking about race-based admissions)

The Affirmative Action case was carpet-bagging. A white conservative political advocacy group that has been seeking to undermine the Civil Rights Act for years was behind it. 

After previous failed attempts to end Affirmative Action the Conservative group solicited an Asian organization. The Harvard lawsuit was some organic thing brought about by Asian students. 

Academically Asian applicants to Harvard out perform White applicants too. Not just Black students. Far more White Applicants are accepted to Harvard than Black or Asian students and White students don't benefit from Affirmative Action. 

The Harvard lawsuit lost its initial court challenge in 2019 and its appeal in 2021. The goal was always to get the case before this version of the court to undue Affirmative Action. The goal was never to ensure more Asians got accepted into Harvard based on Academic performance.","7"

For starters, it should be noted APIAVote and AAJC are explicitly against ending affirmative action, so their polls are more about bolstering their agendas over gauging public opinion.

These organizations rely on poll results like this to present the narrative that Asian-Americans support race-based admissions, when that is not the case.

Every single poll that shows Asian-Americans support affirmative action, like the ones cited in the article, do not ask if they support race-based admissions criteria.

Pew Research is one of the few polling firms that actually examined the issue with nuance, and it is a mixed bag.

In polling released [last month](https://www.pewresearch.org/race-ethnicity/2023/06/08/asian-americans-hold-mixed-views-around-affirmative-action/#:~:text=Across%20all%20these%20approaches%2C%20the,ethnicity%20in%20college%20admissions%20decisions) it showed that for Asian-Americans:

* 50%+ support the general idea of affirmative action
* Asian immigrants (80%) and U.S. born Asian-Americans (64%) both say race and ethnicity should not be considered in admissions, while 21% say race and ethnicity should be factored into college admissions.
* Believe 53%-18% that race-based admissions makes the process more unfair.
* Believe 34%-27% and 47%-29% that race-based admissions is a net positive for colleges and increasing opportunity for students.

So again, a very mixed bag.

When looking at a comprehensive polling of the issue from multiple angles, it is disingenuous to say Asian-Americans support AA as a counterpoint to the SCOTUS ruling when a super-majority of Asians, per Pew, share the same view as the court's majority opinion.

Also, public polling in 2020 in California consistently showed voters supported Prop 16 which would have repealed the state's affirmative action ban (Prop 9), and that  measure failed by double-digits on a presidential election ballot.

So if California can't get affirmative action implemented on a statewide level, hard to argue it is popular nationwide.","28_1_1"

Affirmative action hurts Asian Americans the most where they have the lowest acceptance rates for equal scores compared to all other groups, including white applicants.  This is why most of these lawsuits are centered around Asian discrimination, because the discrimination is the most obvious there.

If AA (Affirmative Action) advocates tacitly accept this sort of discrimination despite the fact that Asians are still a minority and may still not have reached parity in certain aspects of society, then Asian Americans are indeed a pawn to be sacrificed.  Except, here, it raises new forms of systemic racism to combat old ones. To deny this as OP does is borne either of unfamiliarity with the issue or, worse, smacks of a kind of gaslighting.

Almost all criticism of AA focused on how it negatively affects Asians through race-based discrimination are ignored, dismissed, cast as ""Asian self-victimization"", or reframed as merely a ""conservative"" issue by AA advocates.  I have not seen an AA advocate acknowledge or take any of those concerns as valid and somewhat concerning, instead always talking around them, even when alternative forms of AA based on socioeconomic factors are suggested.  Maybe they exist, but I haven't encountered them.

The glib dismissal of a minority group that has faced at least some of the same exploitation and discrimination historically for a policy that favors certain minority groups while sacrificing others is \*exactly\* what using the first group as a pawn looks like, as is gaslighting anyone who calls attention to this.

It's a squeeze from both ends, and when Asian Americans reject being discriminated and treated differently by their skin color or ethnicity, some ""progressive"" article will highlight some progressively-aligned Asians that suspect affirmative action bans because of their ""conservative"" associations-- even though liberal California has also banned such policies.

*That* is *also* what using Asians as a pawn looks like, a sort of opportunistic tokenization that actually works directly *against* their own interests to not be discriminated against.","34_1_1_1_1"

Unless like most white people you don't do any research and you just spew off the latest talking point that you hear on Fox News Breitbart or any of the alt-white Nationalist websites or TV stations. The one thing I can say is constant about white men in particular is their propensity for lying the problem is it's easy to trace out your lies and to present them back to you in real time so the question is what are you going to do","36_1_1_1"

Population of white 197.3m, population of black 48.2m. Arrests/population white = 4.729m/197.3m = 0.024, Arrests/population black = 1.815m/48.2m = 0.038. So blacks had 1.6x more arrests than whites. 

White on white crime for homicides 2594, black on black crime for homicides 2574. So 4x as many white people but the same homicide stats. If the population of blacks was the same as whites then black on black homicides would be 10296.

Rapes by white 11588, rapes by black 4427. If the population size was the same, rapes by black would be 17708, 1.5x as many as whites. 

Assaults by whites 169467, assaults by black 91164. If the population size was the same, assaults by black would be 364656, 2.15x as many as whites.

* Many Asian American groups and leaders are speaking out against the Supreme Court ruling that struck down affirmative action.  

* They point out that while the two cases argued that Harvards and the UNCs policies discriminated against Asian Americans, no Asian American students came forward to testify to having experienced discrimination.   

* Representatives of Asian Americans Advancing Justice said that the decision is anti-Black and that it perpetuates a systemic racism that has always been present in higher education.   

* They also reflected on the disproportionate impact it could have on underrepresented communities under the Asian American Pacific Islander umbrella.   

* Groups say they will continue to hold colleges accountable for making sure their campuses are diverse and their admissions processes are fair. ","44"

JK bro, it was a joke.

The Asians being pushed out was an afterthought though, it wasn't the intent (Asians are always the afterthough...boohoo).  The intent was to open up more spaces in classrooms for Hispanic and Black students, but then Dems decided that life needs to be a perfectly portioned pie chart, so they decided that they needed to start cutting out some of the asians to make room because nobody really gives a fuck about them, we are the least dramatic minority (or at least I'm deeming us that).

From an amici in Fisher:


Even though UT Austins program is modeled closely on others sanctioned previously by this Court, Petitioner Abigail Fisher and her amici are attempting to invalidate UT Austins program as part of a larger effort to roll back all such race-conscious programs. To bolster their ideological challenge, they seek to portray AAPIs as victims who are categorically excluded and burdened by affirmative action programs. The undersigned Amici reject these unfounded claims that AAPIs are harmed by such programs, and categorically oppose such efforts to use the AAPI community as a wedge group to curtail opportunities for racial minorities.

First, Petitioner and her amici disregard the reality that affirmative action programs have opened and continue to open doors for AAPIs in higher education. Instead, they peddle a form of revisionist history where AAPIs achieved educational parity solely by dint of their own efforts and merit. This ignores, however, the fact that AAPIs historically benefited from inclusion in race-conscious admission programs, that certain AAPI subgroups continue to need and benefit from such programs today, and that all AAPI students benefit from more racially diverse (and less racially hostile) college campuses.","1_1_2_1_1_1_1_1"

You clearly misuse the word discrimination. I'm going to try and define discrimination as broadly as possible. Discrimination means that you are treated differently for reasons that are not objectively relevant. In general, that means the group you belong to.

To be a victim of a flood is absolutely a relevant quality for receiving aid. Your skin color or gender is however not a relevant quality for receiving any kind of privilege or punishment.

&gt;And when you are the victim of generations of disenfranchisement and civil rights abuses keeping you from building the generational wealth that other college kids benefit from, you will get the benefit of affirmative action. That too is social contract.

An evil contract. One of the most vicious forms of racism must be the idea of original sin. A curse for what your ancestors did.

I always crack up a little when I see this idea put out there. The idea that progressive programs set out to help disadvantaged and discriminated against minorities are *the real racist* policies. How do you feel about white people emancipating slaves or passing civil rights legislation? Was it insulting to black people because they should have just let them handle it for themselves?

And then this bit: ""Affirmative action robs people of any feeling of legitimate accomplishment.""

...I bet they're just happy they finally got hired and can feed their family. Racist hiring practices being legal means racist people in the position to hire are not concerned with whether the minority has better skills or credentials. Meaning they aren't given the chance to earn that accomplishment. 

There was a really good analogy [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/6r6s4y/jeff_im_not_a_racist_sessions_is_now_going_after/dl35ge0/) That put it really well. 

&gt; In a perfect world you're right. Unfortunately racism (in favor of whites) in the past means there's currently an unlevel playing field. Affirmative action is attemping to level that playing field.

&gt;Think of it this way: There are five people in a race. One player has a car and the other four are running. At some point during the race everyone agrees that the player with the car has an unfair advantage. So now no one can use cars, so it's fair right? Not really, the car owning player still has a significant lead. Even if they ran equally as fast as everyone else, they'll still win. Something needs to be done so that the early advantage is balanced out, so everyone agrees to give everyone except the first place player cars so that they can catch up.

&gt;Is Affirmative Action discrimination? Yes, but it's inherently trying to offset significant long term discrimination.

None of this is happening in a historical vacuum. This country has a history of racial strife. And don't let that word ""history"" fool you into thinking it was that long ago.  We have a current serving [congressman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_\(civil_rights_leader\)#Civil_rights_activism) who marched with MLK and was beaten and arrested because they had the gall to try to achieve for themselves the right to ride on the same bus as white people.

I am not claiming that anything ""worked"" or that certain groups aren't being discriminated against. I am not arguing in favor of affirmative action. I was just pointing out that a specific form of affirmative action (racial quotas) is not allowed. Universities can still use race as a factor in admissions, and yes, that does result in discrimination against certain groups.

I was also pointing out that, in the case of California public schools, all forms of affirmative action are banned, not just quotas. The reason I mentioned that is because the person I was replying to specific mentioned UC Berkeley.

So there are two separate issues:

1. California public schools cannot use race as a factor in admissions at all, due to Prop 209.

2. In states where affirmative action is still allowed (which is most states), race can still be used as one of the factors in admissions, but they cannot use ""quotas"" because of previous Supreme Court decisions.

It was actually in 1978. The 2003 case was *Gratz v. Bollinger*, and the SCOTUS upheld the University of Michigan's affirmative action plan because they said it did not amount to a quota like *Bakke*.

Again, I just want to make sure we are on the same page here. I know that affirmative action has **NOT** been banned across all public universities in the country. I don't know how to say this any clearer.

Other than the Asians that came here hundreds of years ago to build railways, the majority are here because they, their parents, or both are highly educated / skilled immigrants who converted study / work visas into residency.

My father, a white man, was admitted to University of Washington law school in the late 1960's.  At that time, their nod to diversity was to admit one non-white person and one woman per year.

The year he was admitted they cleverly combined the two by admitting an Asian woman.  She was the only person not a white man in the class.  His class protested, went on strike, and fought to get the law school to change policy, and they did.

All admissions criteria are subjective. Subjective based on cultural assumptions (which may be different in different parts of the world). Even grades and test scores are subjective. They purport to measure something, but it's not like measuring the gravitational constant. Aptitude? It's a subjective leap to say someone who scored 10% higher has a higher aptitude. Or GPA measure aptitude.  Or you can think these things measure preparedness for higher levels of study. But all you have is correlations, which are statistical in nature and don't necessarily say much about you as an individual (there are individuals who would did just badly on the SAT but do well in classes). 

Hence, the ""objectively better candidates"" don't exist -- except in the exceptional cases (nothing is simple): for example, the 17 year old who proves a new result in analytic number theory; but we can argue that this subjective as well.

The preferential treatment of the wealthy (not just legacy) is the reason for Harvard's existence (in my subjective judgement). They are a tool of the wealthy. A way that the wealthy signal to each other that they belong to the upper class.

And can you acknowledge that the reason that grades and test scores might be worse is not due to work ethic (just wow) but perhaps due to over-policing, redlining, school funding being tied to property taxes, systemic racism, generational effects of over-incarceration, poor economic outcomes, and other problems that black Americans had created for them by white people?

That's not a serious argument.

A black student who lives in a high-crime, low-property-value area with underfunded schools would very likely score lower on standardized tests than a white female student who, despite facing other types of oppression, went to private schools and had the best education money could buy to prepare her for that test.

It's not a question of work ethic or potential; it's a question of systematically denied opportunity.

The white female student had plenty of educational opportunity, the black student did not. Requiring both to take the same test and grade them as if their academic history were equal simply cements the status quo in place, which still hugely disfavors black people.

Good grief. As I explain [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/yi9h5d/supreme_court_set_to_tackle_affirmative_action/iuj62dp/?context=3), aa as practiced - and the issue literally before the Court - is whether or not racial preferences, e.g. racial discrimination - is permissible in college admissions. *Nobody* disputes this. You've run away there, but seem quite happy to keep making blatantly false statements about aa. 

&gt; You realize that if I use statistical analysis and determine that a question on an application is producing racist outcomes favoring white people and then fix the application so it doesn't do that anymore, I'm not actually discriminating against white people right?

I did. The previous Supreme Courts ignored the literal text of the Civil Rights Act

Generally speaking, people tend to hate the folks just below them on the social totem pole. For the top 0.1%, this means they hate lower upper class and upper middle class ""strivers"" more than they hate a poor person who has accepted their social status and doesn't try to climb the social ladder. Poor and uneducated people will always be subjugated by the ultra rich. But those who are upper middle class or lower upper class present a genuine challenge to the upper upper class dominance of elite universities, country clubs, and boardrooms. A ""striver"" whose parents were cardiologists probably has the money, education, social capital, and IQ to make a serious attempt to end up in the upper upper class.

Ever noticed how working class white supremacists tend to spend most of their time hating on African and Latino Americans, but Peter Thiel is specifically out to exclude Asian Americans from jobs? It's because African and Latino Americans are mostly working class, and Peter Thiel never interacts with working class people. As a member of the upper class, Thiel does have to interact with upper middle class from time to time, and many folks in this social class are Asian American.","4_2"

Race isn't the only deciding factor in Affirmative Action now is it.  It was original designed to help women.

okay then, remove the affirmative action policies and let denied applicants know it wasn't because of their race

if someone who would have been denied previously did not get denied in the post-AA world, then that is proof of racial discrimination anyways

ironically enough, it will be women soon filing lawsuit against affirmative action on the basis of sex/gender since they now make up 60% of undergrads and some colleges have been found to give more preferences to male candidates in an attempt (but what I still believe to be illegal) to balance out the gender ratios","11_1_1_1_1_1_1"

SES preferences are a supposed solution, getting around the ickiness of judging people by their racial or ethnic group. If you read the article linked above, they are claiming that Harvard could still have very high standards and admit a similar proportion of minority students under a system of low-SES preferences. Recall that the University of Texas instituted a ban on the use of race/ethnicity and yet still has an incredibly diverse student body.  There's a lot of complications around this issue, but I think it's possible for elite schools to do without racial/ethnic discrimination. ","3_1"

Richard Kahlenberg, the author of the article, [writes extensively on](https://tcf.org/experts/richard-d-kahlenberg/?session=1&amp;session=1) how we might achieve some of these goals. 

One of the most interesting points Ive come across as Ive been following this issue for the last several months, is the fact that one of the factors that impacts the rate of Asian students who apply vs. Asian student who are accepted to Harvard, is that their parents (mostly those in the Chinese American community) *make them* apply. This is in contrast to the data in Kahlenbergs report that suggests that there are many highly qualified students of other demographics (mostly Hispanic and African American) who do not even apply to highly competitive schools. It would be interesting to examine the variety of factors that prevent highly qualified lower SES students from applying in the first place.

Ive also found some relevant nuance about this issue by reading some conversation about it on the [Asian American subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/9meo0b/the_rise_and_fall_of_affirmative_action/), if anyone is interested. 

While Kahlenberg seems reputable and sincere in his efforts to maintain ethnic/racial diversity and improve the overall quality of our education system for more *economically* diverse students, I cant help be extremely apprehensive and skeptical of the goals of the guy that hired him to produce this particular report. The Students for Fair Admissions, is basically just this guy [Edward Blum](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher) who seems to have an ax to grind because he lost a Congressional election in the 90s, which he attributed to gerrymandering that he claimed favored African Americans and Latinx voters. I worry that Kahlenberg may have taken up with Blum in a sort of devils bargain among people with goals that seem more similar on the surface, but are radically different once you do a bit of investigating. 

Blum helped bring the case that gutted the Voting Rights Act. This case against Harvard is just a vehicle to move toward a purely meritocratic system that would *bolster* existing ethnic and racial SES disparities. Blum isnt interested in remediating the conditions that underly the need for Affirmative Action policies, whether they are race/ethnicity based or SES based, or based on other factors. He just thinks that white people are being oppressed in the name of diversity. It wouldnt be the first time white men [used Asian people as pawns](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks) in their attempt to disenfranchise other minority populations.

Your own article you linked below disputes this claim:

*Besides, University lawyers argue, Harvard is already pursuing race-neutral programs that help achieve a diverse student body. Attorneys pointed to the schools generous financial aid program, its wide-ranging recruitment efforts, and its special consideration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, among other things.*

*Harvards efforts to promote diversity go far beyond its consideration of race in the admissions process, lawyers wrote in a June court filing.*

Also, see the [Harvard Financial Aid Initiative](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/hear-our-students/economic-diversity) started in 2004:

*This is simple: anyone can afford Harvard.*

*We have a long tradition of removing economic barriers for students who want to attend Harvard. Announced in 2004, The Harvard Financial Aid Initiative (HFAI) is a continuation of this tradition and greatly expands financial aid to families who earn less than $80,000. And, if your family earns less than $65,000 per year, your parents pay nothing for you to attend Harvard. It is simply our effort to make sure you and your family know you can afford to attend Harvard.*

*There is no special application or qualification necessaryjust apply for financial aid when you apply for admission. Applying for financial aid does not hinder your chances for admission.*","7_1_1"

Here's some quotes from the lawsuit yesterday, with SFFA lawyer Mortara questioning Harvard's Dean Khurana:

&gt;Dont you actually think that Harvards class should have a socioeconomic makeup that looks a lot more like America, provided the students were academically qualified to be at Harvard? Mortara asked Khurana. Your personal opinion, sir?

&gt;I dont, Khurana replied.

&gt;What is special about wealthy people that Harvard needs to have them overrepresented by a factor of six on its campus? Mortara asked later.

&gt;In response, Khurana said Mortara was missing the point.

&gt;Were not trying to mirror the socioeconomic or income distribution of the United States, Khurana said. What were trying to do is identify talent and make it possible for them to come to a place like Harvard.

From Alito's dissent in Fisher v. Texas:

&gt;On appeal to the Fifth Circuit and in Fisher I, however, UT began to emphasize its intraracial diversity argument. UT complained that the Top Ten Percent Law hinders its efforts to assemble a broadly diverse class because the minorities admitted under that law are drawn largely from certain areas of Texas where there are majority minority schools. These students, UT argued, tend to come from poor, disadvantaged families, and the University would prefer a system that gives it substantial leeway to seek broad diversity within groups of underrepresented minorities. In particular, UT asserted a need for more African-American and Hispanic students from privileged backgrounds. See, e.g., Brief for Respondents in No. 11 345, at 34 (explaining that UT needs race-conscious admissions in order to admit [t]he African-American or Hispanic child of successful professionals in Dallas)

And he continues:
&gt;Moreover, although
UT reframes its argument, it continues to assert
that it needs affirmative action to admit privileged minorities.
For instance, UTs brief highlights its interest in
admitting [t]he black student with high grades from
Andover. Brief for Respondents 33. Similarly, at oral
argument, UT claimed that its interests in the educational
benefits of diversity would not be met if all of [the]
minority students were . . . coming from depressed socioeconomic
backgrounds.

You are moving the goalposts. Your original claim was that Harvard (and also UT from 2016) *dont care about socioeconomic diversity.* That is demostrably untrue, based on the initiaitives they have taken to seek out students from economically disadvantaged schools and areas. Do they still have more work they could do to improve admissions of highly qualified students from lower SES backgrounds? Most certainly! Heres an article from Harvard Magazine that takes a look at the issue, and discusses both the efforts and shortcomings toward [recruiting for more economic diversity](https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/08/admissions-office-strategies-low-income). 

Just because they dont set quotas for student diversity, whether it is related to race/ethnicity, or economics, or anything else, doesnt mean their admission process is devoid of efforts to attract and admit students from lower SES communities and schools. Just because they dont aim to have their student body be an exact reflection of the socio-economic breakdown of the country, doesnt mean they *dont care about* socio-economic diversity of inclusion.

One of the data points Richard Kahlenberg, who wrote the article posted by the OP, mentions in his report is that highly qualified students with lower SES who could gain admissions to highly competitive schools, apply to these schools at much lower rates than comparable students with higher SES. It would be good to examine why this is. Im sure there are things Harvard could do to improve recruitment among this pool of students, but my sense is that the reasons students dont apply are more complicated and are also related to other constraints people of lower SES have in general (travel expenses, need to contribute to household income, lack of savings, etc, etc.) 

Regardless, the question in the lawsuit isnt whether Harvard does the best it could at promoting economic diversity; it is whether considering factors like race/ethnicity should be permitted **at all**. Again, your own article is proof positive that it is necessary:

*Kahlenberg presented four variations of this admissions scenario Monday. All predicted an increased percentage of Asian-American admits. Three of the four scenarios led to increased Hispanic enrollment and decreased white enrollment.* **Every single one of the simulations predicted a decreased percentage of African-American admits.**

*But Harvard has its own experts.*

*Relying on analysis from University of California Economics Professor David E. Card, the University argued ahead of the trial that ending race-conscious admissions would severely drive down minority enrollment. Card, who was paid by Harvard for his work, projected that a* **race-blind admissions process would reduce the number of College students who identify as African-American, Hispanic, or Other by roughly 50 percent.**

Which brings us back to the main reason [Edward Blum brought this lawsuit in the first place](https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/affirmative-action/meet-edward-blum-man-who-wants-kill-affirmative-action-higher): it serves as a vehicle to disenfranchise African American and Lantix people in broader ways that serve his pro-white agenda.

If you really think Edward Blum gives a flying f**k about how many Asian people get into Harvard, then I have a bridge Id like to sell you. His main concern is reducing African American and Latinx access to representation in government, and jobs, and other spheres of life that he believes diminishes the power of the white majority. He is trying to establish legal precedent for the removal of race and ethnicity based Affirmative Action, that he can use to degrade protections for minoroties in other spheres of social and economic and governmental life.

Remember folks, they are saying that the ACLU are the racists here. This is exactly what I am talking about when it comes to Blum. Read the articles I posted.

Here an excerpt:

&gt;After losing a congressional election in the early 1990s, Blum, who is white, challenged the Texas redistricting process as discriminating in favor of African-American and Latinx voters. While his success in that case, Bush v. Vera, was limited to particular districts, among his other challenges to the voting rights, Blum was behind Shelby v. Holder. That case gutted important protections in the Voting Rights Act with drastic effects for voters of color. His attacks on laws and policies designed to promote the equality of people of color are not limited to voting rights. Blum also crafted the unsuccessful challenge to race-conscious college admissions programs in Fisher v. University of Texas.

&gt;Failing in Fisher, Blum baldly strategized that he needed Asian plaintiffs. He formed Students for Fair Admissions as a vehicle to file litigation. The organizations leadership consists solely of Mr. Blum, Abagail Fisher, and Richard Fisher, her father. Through Students for Fair Admissions, Blum recruited members and filed his challenge to college admissions against Harvard with a twist. This time, Blum claims that the consideration of race discriminates against Asian-Americans.

&gt;While Blum now purports to represent the interests of Asian-Americans, none of his goals in litigation have changed. Blum isnt seeking to ensure that Harvard adequately addresses any implicit biases against Asian-Americans in its admissions practices, nor is he asking Harvard to take other affirmative steps to recognize the value of Asian-American applicants.

&gt;The relief Blum seeks is narrowly focused on what has always been his objective: a prohibition on any awareness of race in college admissions. If Blum gets his wish, statistical projections show that white applicants will be the primary beneficiaries. Not talking about race doesnt erase discrimination; it reinforces the privileges of white applicants by ignoring the ways in which deep-seeded structural racial inequality impacts individuals.

&gt;Blums cynical attempt to use members of the Asian-American community seeks to pit people of color against one another.","7_1_1_1_1_1_1"

&gt;sports at elite schools are a quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids, and play a big role in keeping these institutions so stubbornly white

Harvard, Yale, Prinston are all around ~ 46% white. (Same applies to MIT, CalTech, Stanford and so on - all majority nonwhite). I am too lazy to look for links, but I have looked for these numbers recently since the topic came up here in another thread, so I am pretty sure of the numbers - all elite schools are well below 50%. While the US population is, what? 70%? I have no idea of the precise number, and I am not going to bother looking it up, but definitely over 50% white. 
  
In light of these numbers, the choice of words *so stubbrornly* in ""keeping these institutions so stubbornly white"" takes a very curious bend. They are not majority white, and the US population is, so who is being stubborn here, uh? And how would a regular/everyday Joe-type person react to the fact that whites are already underrepresented, but the Atlantic writers are still not satisfied and call those (already lower than their share of population) numbers ""stubborn""? 

I wish those ""new"" leftists / progressives / SJWs / grievance olympians would lay of their useless, divisive, deeply racist rhetoric.  ""Stubbornly white""! What on Earth? (/shakes head)

Anyway, college sports shouldn't take priority over academics. So absolutley, sports participation shouldn't have such a significant role in admissions. 

And race should have no place in consideration either - only merit. Then you wouldn't have this toxic ""stubborn"" haggling over who gets what share unfairly - whoever did the best work and whoever had the best achievement record, gets admitted. ","2"

One, almost all applicants to ivy leagues have perfect records, including grades, transcript, and SATs. So they have to look at other info. Otherwise the school would have to increase in size tenfold.

Two, achievement record assumes everyone had equal opportunity prior to college admissions. This is not the case.

FYI the reason that whites are ""underrepresented"" is they aren't as qualified as other ethnicities, especially Asian Americans (including Indian Americans).

The point of the article is that documents related to the Harvard lawsuit brought to light the fact that athletes and legacies had lower qualification requirements for admittance, and therefore took the spots of Asian Americans who were more qualified.

These policies that favor athletes and legacies advantage white applicants because they are more likely to be in those groups than Asian-Americans.

why over Asian American students? You are showing your bias. No. They discard perfect resumes from midwestern white all-staters with ACT 36 instead, when they enroll those marginally performing athletes.

What came to light so far in trial is that Harvard admitted to intentionally recruiting less qualified white students from ""sparse country"" (1310 PSAT) compared to Asian Americans (1380 PSAT) from other more diverse states.

Now that was just in recruitment, but it does seem to undercut the idea that athletes are predominantly taking the spots of qualified white students in the Midwest, as Harvard already has a system to try to recruit more white students from Midwestern states.

This isn't my bias. Asian Americans, as a demographic group, outperform white students in academic achievement. In 2015, 60% of students scoring 1500+ were Asian American, 33% were white.

In raw numbers, 53,000 Asian-Americans scored above 700, 48,000 whites. 30,000 Asian-Americans scored above 750, 16,000 whites.

Given this, the fact that Asian-Americans are 19% of the student body at Harvard and whites are 44% seems off.

Using SAT scores as an indicator of merit, one would expect white students to be 27% of the student population and Asian-American students to be 35%. I think I did the math correctly, it's late.

yes it is. We are talking about the quota /affirmative action /diversity juggling here. Having the white enrollment targeted at that 46 percent, the ""athlete"" spots are being taken away from the qualified flyover states candidates.

Why would a country that has universal healthcare, kindergarten, child care, and almost free university need to deal with the inequities that arise from not having those things?  
Moreover, feminist analyses of many European countries find they are much more gender equitable than the United States.  

Of course, this fails to account for the wide variety of countries in Europe. Portugal is extremely different than Norway. Same with the United Kingdom and Greece.

As if there is a singular standard for merit and that the composite of campuses aren't otherwise influenced.

Merit - Grades, Test Scores, Sports, Arts, **Legacy**, etc are all considered and weighted differently student by student. Merit doesn't have a singular standard.

George Bush got into Yale with average grades because of legacy.

Every section of the SAT has a maximum score of 800.

&gt;By comparison, white admits earned an average score of 745 across all sections, Hispanic-American admits earned an average of 718, Native-American and Native-Hawaiian admits an average of 712, and African-American admits an average of 704.
**For students of every race, the average SAT scores of admits were always higher than the average SAT scores of applicants belonging to the same demographic group.**
https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/10/22/asian-american-admit-sat-scores/

&gt;Last year, the Class of 2024s recruited athlete class was slightly more diverse than the year before  the proportion of white athletes dropped to 72.9 percent from 74.5 percent, alongside increases in the share of athletes identifying as Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, and Black or African American. This year, however, white students represent 82.9 percent of freshman recruited athletes.

Athletes identifying as Hispanic or Latinx dropped from 14 percent to 7.5 percent this year, while those identifying as **Asian fell from 13.1 percent to 8.2 percent. Similarly, only 10.3 percent of athletes identified as Black or African American**, compared to 12.1 percent last year, and no athletes who answered the survey identified as American Indian or Native American.
https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2021/9/8/2025-freshman-survey/

&gt;Harvard Class of 2025 Statistics composition when broken down by ethnicity is as follows:

Asian: 25.9%

Latinos: 12.5%

African Americans: 15.9%
https://admissionsight.com/harvard-class-of-2025-statistics/#:~:text=Harvard%20Class%20of%202025%20Statistics%27%20composition%20when%20broken%20down%20by,African%20Americans%3A%2015.9%25

So it is absolutely true that the Asians accepted into Harvard on average have better test scores than Black students accepted into Harvard. Asians accepted into Harvard have better test scores than the White Students too. The paradigm isn't truly one of Black vs Asian. Additionally all students accepted into Harvard have above average test scores period. No one is getting in with average test scores. 

Asians make up 26% of the class of 2025. Yet only 8% of the athletes from that class participating in campus athletics. Meanwhile Black students of '25 make up 16% of the class and 10% of the athletes. Which illustrated the Black students have a significantly higher ratio of athletics participation. Whites even have a ratio. Sports are a normal consideration for college admissions. This is a contributing factor for why the average test scores for White and Blacks aren't high as they are for Asian applicants. A higher percentage of White and Black applicants are involved in addition disciplines of consideration. 

The argument that Affirmative Action somehow preferences strictly by race isn't accurate. A lot of variables go into who is admitted into a school. In addition to athletics a number of forgien students are admitted, schools have veteran programs, legacy programs, etc. It is never a matter of thousands of identical applicants all competing for the same spots. 

Allowing a school to decide it wants a couple percentage points more foreign students, veterans, Catholics, athletes, or Latino students on campus because they believe it is good for the campuses environment as a whole is fine in my opinion. 

If the argument here was that Asian students were discriminated against I think one needs to demonstrate how eliminating Affirmative Action changes things for Asian applicants. I believe that was done here. Again, Asian applicants absolutely have better average test scores that Black applicants. However that is also true for the White applicants and no one is claiming the White applicants are being selected based on race.","5_1_2_1_1"

Youre right.  there is not enough talk about HBCUs other than Howard and Spelman. Many kids dont even explore other options. And yes, in many scenarios there are instances where you can get the a HBCU at the same cost or cheaper than a PWI. 

But there is still a reality that even with this, sometimes PWIs can still be cheaper. I wanted to go to an HBCU for awhiile but went to a top PWI bc I had a full ride since my parents made under a certain amount and we were broke. I felt stuck in that choice. That was me and several people I was in school with and many other PWIs have a higher number of scholarships and grants to give out. And many athletes are in a conundrum bc they have to go to the right program and many of HBCUs have teams that are here today and gone tomorrow. I wanted to go to one and the year I reached out about recruitment, they didnt respond and I realized it was bc they had no team that year. And that terrified me. 

Theres unfortunately a lot of constraints of why people pick the schools they do but youre right, it should be encouraged more for those who it suits. Too many of us think our own schools arent good enough which is not the truth and very self-hating. So I critique more this and other self-hating reasons why ppl dont go to an HBCU rather than the decision in and of itself bc we dont know why someone went to a PWI. PWI doesnt always mean anti-HBCU and I just say this too as someone who is always assumed to be anti-HBCU in HBCU v. PWI debates bc of where I went to school when really I was just poor with a full ride.>7<þ@ When I have kids, I would love for them to go to an HBCU especially bc I know theyll be in a better financial situation than I was. 

sidenote: its also interesting too bc we value the connections that PWIs have which is true. I got connections from my school and was opened to a network that I never wouldve been exposed to had I not went there but it begs the question, why dont dont we value the connections we can make amongst each other and build amongst each other the same way we value those other connections.","8_2_1_1_1_1_2_1_1"

It was tax breaks/credits if you had an ""affirmative action"" plan and all you had to do was ""prove"" you recruited x amount of minority to get those tax breaks, ie jobs hiring from within but advertising they are hiring just to interview a bunch of BIPOC people who never had a chance, so they can say they fullfilled their targeted recruitment. But then you have people (like me) who never take the time to research anything themselves, so people assume due to the media that affirmative action was ""forcing"" people to be hired and had to meet ""quotas"" when in actuality it was a workaround for money- like most things.","24"

This angered me because an overwhelming percentage of ethnic minorities ARE working class, the lie that the reason why BAME perform well is because schools ignore working class boys.

The reason people from BAME backgrounds do well is because we have to! We have to do twice/thrice/quadruple the work to get even half of the benefits. 

White working class boys may do poorly in school, but most will get work after they leave school, while 50% of young Black men of working age, including graduates, are unemployed and continue to have fewer job and advancement opportunities.

A white w/c boy who does poorly at school still has way more chance of getting an apprenticeship and future employment in traditionally working class professions. 

There aren't many Black people working in construction and associated industries, car manufacturing, the coal and steel industries, etc, hell, even your local cake factory will be 99% white. 

Working class white boys are overrepresented in all the manual trades and service &amp; hospitality industries. A poor academic record doesn't necessarily result in poorer life outcomes for them. 

That report made out like they were victims of BAME success, when that's not the case. That report tl:dr was basically ""white boys are suffering because Black and ME people are too good at what they do."" I doubt one has anything to do with the other. 

And quite frankly, if w/c white boys aren't doing as well in school as w/c BAME pupils, you have to look at why schools &amp; teachers are apparently neglecting them in favour of BAME pupils, and you have to look at the parent(s) and what expectations they have for their sons. Where are their parents? 

That's the accusation always levelled at us, but it works both ways. You can't blame white boys doing poorly in school because they have less to lose in the long run, on Black kids being too diligent because they have everything to lose.","44_1_1"

Im so glad that my point resonates! 100% with everything you just said! As BAME, it is drilled into us from childhood that education is important and it is the tool for us to succeed in life.

1. On the one hand, Brown v. Board of Education was almost 70 years ago. Did we really still need affirmative action to desegregate schools?
2. As someone who was accepted into multiple university and has multiple degrees with Latin honors, did I only make it this far because of affirmative action and not my own intelligence?

I also had another realization when chatting with a friend. I worked in higher ed for a decade and I saw how there were students who just didn't do well. And the focus wasn't telling students to cut their losses and pursue other opportunities/ come back to college when they're ready. The focus was retaining students. Meaning students who didn't have scholarships (or lost their scholarships because they weren't able to handle the academic rigor) were just taking out tons and tons of loans, even if they weren't doing well at college and even if it would have taken them years to graduate. This to me is disingenuous for universities to do because this is actively exacerbating the wealth gap. We are taking young people and saddling them with debt and most of those people are black.   


I think we're going to start to see more of a economic shift that could be positive. The trades are dying right now because tradesmen are getting older and so many students just go straight to college instead of to apprenticeships. Because there are so many vacancies in the trades, the old boys club is becoming less and less diluted and more women and non white people are apprenticing. If black students aren't getting into college because of affirmative action, they could still enter the trades and make six figure salaries without crippling debt. After they save the salaries, if they want to go to college, they probably could put themselves through with little to no debt. I'm hoping this is a net positive for people and maybe it's a better way to uplift other communities.

Do you think the white kid who got in because their dad was frat brothers with the dean of admissions  is thinking this?

Do you think the kid whose parents were able to spare thousands of dollars for private tutoring says "" did I get in because my parents had the means to support furthering my education or did I get in because of my own intelligence""?.

You have to be an exceptional student to even get past the threshold for these schools. You wouldn't have gotten multiple degrees with honors because of AA. Why are you underestimating yourself?

And sure the debt issue is bad all around, but is simply not going to school the solution to that? The issue surrounding that is much more complex than simply ""don't go to collge"".  [X](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-racial-wealth-gap-financial-aid-and-college-access/) 

And yes the trades are valid jobs and should be encouraged as well, but the ""6 figure salary"" promise is overplayed. Most tradespeople are not going to be making that much. Lifetime earnings for trade jobs is also significantly lower. Not to mention, depending on the type of work, job security is lower, more contract work is involved (which means not required to pay health benefits) also the physical toll that trades work has on people is significant.  A healthy community would have a healthy balance of people in all types of jobs, not just trades. There also needs to be black teachers, politicians, doctors, scientists, urban planners,  policymakers, historians, engineers, etc. Don't underestimate the importance of college education in terms of social mobility in general. This isn't an either-or-situation.","58_1"

But at the same time, if someone is putting themselves in tens of thousands of dollars of debt, delaying their earnings by more than four years (because the average student graduates in 6 years), they are hurting themselves in the long run. Your Brookings institute article pretty much argues that Black families have fewer assets that are not counted (retirement accounts, home equity) when calculating financial aid awards compared to white families. That has nothing to do with whether or not college is a good investment. If anything, it just highlights that accumulating more debt when you have fewer assets is not going to lead to equal opportunities--it could put you further behind.  


Re: trades. I agree that the starting pay for the apprenticeship level of trades is low. But you can start off with that at a very young age and start earning at 19. For the sake of argument, I'll start the apprentice off at $45,000. Someone who goes to college right out of high school, meanwhile, has already taken on $20,000 of debt in one year with no way to pay it back. By the time the college student has finished at 22 (assuming that they can finish at 22), they are $80,000 in debt. The apprentice has earned $180,000 in gross income and has started to either accumulate money in a retirement account or started paying into a pension plan. And even if the apprentice had taken on loans during those 4 years, at least he can discharge his loans in bankruptcy, but the college student couldn't.  


Finally, I absolutely agree that there are specialized careers that require a college degree, but there are so many more that don't. I think unless you are going into a specialized field that requires a degree (like all of the ones you listed), you should go to college. But so many 18 year olds don't know what they want to do, or they want to do something that doesn't actually require a degree, or they just go to college because ""it's the next step."" Those students, in my view, should probably wait and see.  


But back to the purpose of affirmative action. I'd rather see someone get rejected from college when they're not able to succeed in college than to see someone get accepted and fail out after accumulating debt equivalent to a down payment on a house. If someone can't get accepted based on their grades out of high school or test scores or whatever, then they should get up to speed at a community college later and try again. I don't think that letting in a student who may not do well is helpful to that student in the long run. (But then again, who am I to make that call? That's why this is so conflicting for me).","58_1_1"

Pinker raises a few interesting points about the perceived uselessness of making evaluations for college admissions on the basis of participation in extracurricular activities, legacy status, and other non-academic ""qualifications,"" but I think that he fails to take into consideration the sheer numbers game aspect of it all. If you just make Ivy League admissions solely about standardized testing scores, then this would obligate university officials to accept every student who manages to reach the 2240-2400 SAT range; although these kinds of scores aren't widespread among the general group of test-takers, thousands of students every year receive these sorts of evaluations (and the 8 Ivy League schools could hardly afford to give every kid with high percentile scores a spot in their next freshman classes). Plus, are we really going to argue that a hypothetical poor student with a 2250 on the SAT and a 4.0 GPA didn't strive significantly harder to perform well academically than a hypothetical wealthy student with the same stats? Would we also make the case that a student with a 2300 and no extracurriculars is explicitly ""better"" than a student with a 2270 who participated in a sports team and logged hundreds of hours volunteering for a homeless shelter? It is perfectly all right to make the claim that certain aspects of college admissions are in need of retooling, but Pinker's ideas represent a radical adjustment to the status quo that doesn't provide a fair evaluation for all applicants.

No matter how smart, or how noble their intentions, it's ultimately human beings that are making these decisions, and we are fallible.  We're not superior arbiters of fairness when compared to objective methods.

This is why what Mayor Bloomberg did for NYC high schools was so noble in battling against holistic admissions.  He recognized that the kids getting into the elite schools were often poor immigrants who would never have that opportunity with holistic admissions.  They can't afford extracurriculars in every sense of monetary cost, free time, and knowledge of how to game the system.  These are things insiders and rich people can do when you have affirmative action or holistic admissions.  The upper class parents can now utilize unfair advantages in grooming their child for advantages that poorer parents are unaware and incapable of.

Also, the difference between 2100 and 2400 is pretty drastic.  [Harvard's 25th percentile has SAT scores of 2120](http://collegeapps.about.com/od/collegeprofiles/p/harvard_profile.htm), meaning at least 1/4 of their class is not even close to being that exceptional.

http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/SAT-Percentile-Ranks-2013.pdf

Look at those percentiles.  A 2100 score is barely in the top 5%.  A 2300 score is around the top 1%.  Harvard, along with many other ""elite"" schools accept students that simply will not be able to maximize the opportunities afforded to them.  

The difference between a mind on the order of 1 of 20 and 1 of 100 is enormous, when extrapolated throughout a student body, in terms of their ultimate potential to contribute to society.  The Ivy League has too few minds in the top 0.n% and too many minds in the top 3%.  The difference is noticeable at that level.  

To simplify, if we section off that group of the top 3%, it would be like rejecting the most objectively qualified of 10-30 students, in order to accept the worst ranked one.  To say the objectively worst student out of 10-30 has the extracurriculars to overcome the best kid is nonsensical.  We're really just accepting students based on the biases of people in charge of admissions.  Whenever I hear an elite school rejecting a 2300 SAT score, I'm reminded of how idiotic this process is.","3_2"
"https://www.reddit.com/r/asianamerican/comments/2fnx0i/the_ivy_league_is_broken_and_only_standardized/","UncleTomAlert","2014-09-06",1410043967,1,1,0,0,"Focusing solely on obtaining students in ""the top 3%"" of test scores is quite meaningless, unless you are truly concerned with intellectual elitism/snobbery. You say that a person with a 2120 ""won't be able to maximize the opportunities afforded to them,"" even though this level of performance should be sufficient enough to graduate from pretty much any university (and qualify for post-graduate training). I'm not saying that we should admit more students with scores in the 2100s to elite universities, but on the same token, it's not as if we've got an epidemic of Harvard drop-outs. For schools such as Caltech and MIT, I can understand why there might be more stringent requirements for intelligence (as an example, Caltech heavily frowns upon any SAT I math score below 760.) In the fields of engineering and hard science research, it makes sense to exclusively recruit the ""cream of the crop"" and choose students by intelligence only; however, for everything else, this approach is highly illogical. The vast majority of students at Ivy League universities major in the liberal arts fields or in the social sciences, and the average person attempting to obtain a BA in psychology hardly needs a 97th percentile IQ to complete their degree (no offense to psychology majors intended). By pursuing your suggested course of action, the Ivy admissions process will be converted into even more of a crapshoot than it already is, and you'd quickly end up placing too much focus on qualities such as technical proficiency and raw intelligence. People with 2300 SAT scores would still be rejected from Harvard under this new scheme, and there still wouldn't be enough space for every high-scoring student; also, it would become harder to differentiate one high-scoring student from another if you couldn't use any other determining factor to assist the comparison. Diversity would suffer as well, and most URMs would be pushed out altogether. This seems like a bleak future for higher education in America, and it just isn't something that the vast majority of people would put their support behind.

A better plan would be to simply retool AA to work *primarily* on the basis of average annual income rather than race, destroy legacy admissions, and expand ""impacted"" major requirements (i.e. make it so only the highest scoring students can go into the most competitive/difficult fields of study). (Of course, since this position is a compromise, it can be guaranteed that individuals at both sides of the political divide wouldn't listen to it or give it the time of day; nevertheless, it's the most reasonable concept in existence at the moment for patching this problem.)","3_2_1"

* What exactly is this relationship of high test scores to intellectual elitism/snobbery?
* What is the ceiling of someone's ability to contribute to post-graduate studies with a 2120 SAT score vs a 2300 score?  For example, could they get a philosophy PhD from Harvard?  My guess is usually not for the former, while possibly for the latter.
* Is graduation the bar we're setting when defending the 97th percentile students?
* Are 800 math scores worthless in non-STEM fields?  If not, then what are they worth?
* Shouldn't elite liberal arts schools have elite standards for critical reading or the writing portion, a la MIT for SAT Math?
* Is technical proficiency or raw intelligence mutually exclusive from other cognitive abilities with are apparently useful for liberal arts?
* What cognitive traits do these 2100 SAT score students have that 2300 SAT score students are missing?
* How many 2300 SAT scores do you believe are out there?
* How big is the student body of these elite schools?

I'd suggest searching for the studies that examined the elite scores of 7th grade SAT student takers, and see how their lives turned out.  SAT scores have been overwhelmingly good indicators of future contributors.

Anyways, I doubt people will be convinced by logic or evidence, because we are irrational.  As immigration continues and the population grows, the absurdity of this policy will become more evident, as it has started to become a recognized issue.

I can't speak for others, but that would likely be superior to what we currently have, yet still inferior to meritocracy which already brings in a wide range of students' parental incomes.  Your suggestion is closer to a meritocracy, because it eliminates many of the ""holistics"" aspects of admissions.","3_2_1_1"

No study of IQ heritability and not even the most ardent of IQ fundamentalists have ever put the heritability of IQ at 100%.  Socialization/environment/nutrition are and will always have importance (and there's probably an interplay between genetic predisposition and environment, with unusual abnormalities in one affecting the other).  In reality it's probably neither nature nor nurture, but rather nature and nurture together which affect intellectual outcomes.

And while I'm aware that people like Pinker (and Charles Murray....*shudder*) generally tout the rigidity of SAT scores, we have numerous examples of other data points that belie this claim.  /u/I_trip_over_hurdles' comment is one of these, and if he/she had simply assumed that his/her initial score was an inflexible ceiling and never studied further then this person would have had a much lower SAT score, possibly attended a different college under different conditions and thereafter taken a different path in life.  I personally knew people in high school who raised their SAT scores by 100-200 points.  I have friends who became Kaplan SAT tutors who raised some of their students' scores by several hundred points.  I raised my LSAT score (not exactly the SAT but still a standardized test) by 9 points out of a possible 180, which has a drastic impact on the category of law school which you are able attend.

But Steven Pinker said that none of these events could have happened, so I suppose that they didn't.

People who raise their scores by hundreds of points are probably people who did not understand the subject matter or optimal test taking strategies at first. Once those barriers are dealt with, though, the SAT is a very good predictor of general mental aptitude.

If you raised your math test score by 200 points then you just very much strengthened my argument that you can raise your test scores.

So if you had not had access to the prep which raised your score (say that you were too poor to buy the books and had to work 5 hour shifts after school to support your family), then you wouldn't have raised your score by 200 points, right?

And poor people taking the SAT's are much more likely to be environmentally, socially and nutritionally stunted than upper-middle class and upper-class people who take the SAT's.  Most of the IQ differences between two people in the upper class will be attributable to genetics.  This doesn't hold when comparing an upper-class person with a poor person.

My entire point here is that it's not fair that some people have the resources to obtain the 200 point gain which you achieved while others do not.

Not everyone will understand the test materials.  That's your faulty assumption.  Most poor people taking the SAT will remain in the same position you were in before you artificially boosted your scores via test prep.  They will also not have the social pressure to prep for it like wealthier people will.  And they will have less (no) time to study.  



&gt;and that IQ itself is mostly genetic in nature

Well, the Flynn Effect and the diminished Black-White IQ gap between the 1950's-1980's might like to get a word in there, for starters.

But discussions of IQ are immaterial if we can agree that SAT scores can be decoupled from IQ in some situations.

Your SAT math score, for instance, would be about 2 standard deviations higher than what it would be expected if you had been poor and unable to study (assuming that your initial math score was around 500 and your post-study one was around 700).  

Studying for the SAT math section made your performance IQ appear to be about 2 standard deviations higher than that of ""poor you"" in the eyes of college admissions officers.  On a Weschler IQ test, where a standard deviation is 15 points and with the average SAT taker having a slightly above average IQ, that would be a difference in PIQ between roughly 103 and 133.

Those thirty IQ points are the difference between ""just above normal"" and ""just in Mensa"".

Do you think that your Performance IQ is Mensa worthy?  Well, your college does.

&gt;I don't disagree with any of this, really.

Then I'd hope that we can agree that Pinker's prescription for an increased reliance on test scores which you know from personal experience to be alterable is an unjust and anti-meritocratic one.

Well, there's this post about SAT prep, and it has a link to the actual study showing that test preparation has marginal effects.  I'm not sure how you refute this data.  Beyond a few practice trials, test preparation is mostly a poor investment of time.  The vast majority of students are better off doing real learning or working.  I know bright students who take actual college courses for credit, rather than waste their high school years on SAT prep to get into college.

This isn't to say that there aren't cases where some individuals can and do improve scores drastically.  It's just not common and overall improvement doesn't seem much different than kids who don't prep, since some of them also have much higher scores the next time they take it.  We all have anecdotes.  We can't take anecdotes showing a positive result bias and extrapolate from there what is the likely scenario, when we already have thorough studies with plenty of data showing otherwise.  Solid empiricism trumps conjecture.","4_1_1_2"

The wording of the guarantees basically makes it trivial for them to get out of having to give a refund if they just claim that the student did something wrong.

Moreover, most people *can* improve their scores through being familiar with whatever tests they are taking, though scores plateau after that point.  If you go in to a test having no idea what is covered, then you waste a lot of time reading and internalizing directions, and that could cost you quite a bit.  That's a one-time fix, though, and test prep courses are usually a $2000 solution to a problem that can be solved with a $10 book and an afternoon of studying.

Edit: There are sometimes a few tricks you can learn about tests, too, but I'm not sure if those really help much (and getting a book still beats dropping two grand on a class).  I'm also not sure if the studies on this take into account the fact that most test prep is pretty much garbage.

Sure, i'd agree that test prep companies are generally not very good.  But data points belying theories also need to be taken into account when theorizing.  I didn't study for the SATs so I can't comment on those, but I did take a Kaplan LSAT class and felt like I got very little out of it.  My LSAT score didn't appreciably increase after our class ended.  It was a waste of money, and the conventional wisdom amongst people serious about studying for the LSAT is that you shouldn't waste your time with professional prep companies.  However, studying on my own for several months did improve my LSAT scores and I'm not the only person who has had this experience.  I wouldn't be surprised if generally speaking classes for SAT prep (and GRE prep and LSAT prep ) are a waste of money for most people, especially if they simply show up to the class and expect to improve by just passively absorbing the information or if they are there because their parents forced them to go, while a subset of people who are more motivated and who grapple with the material more than others are more likely to experience testing gains.  It's also possible that learning on your own is a more reliable method of increasing your score than sitting in a class with 30 people and relying on a mass-marketed testing strategy to shoot knowledge into your head.

Saying that professional testing companies don't on the whole improve their students' scores (which I'd agree with) doesn't demonstrate that students cannot generally improve their scores on  standardized tests through study; it just shows that these companies are not the best at mass-producing means of teaching their students how to appreciably improve their scores on these tests.  It also doesn't take into account the psychological motivation of the student (I'd also bet that there are individual variances as to how reactive students are to individualized or group study, but these would probably even out when you look at millions of people).


This would also explain the paradoxical discrepancy between the modest overall test-prep gains that you linked to (and that people like Pinker and Charles Murray always cite) and individual examples of people who belie these data, either as outliers in their prep classes or by studying on their own.

The problem is that if you want to do what I did on the LSAT you need resources, both the money to buy prep books and the ability to set aside numerous hours to study.  Not everyone possesses these resources in equal abundance.

TL;DR: Your link doesn't show that test prep doesn't help, it just shows that test prep companies generally don't provide test gains, which I'd agree with.","4_1_1_2_2"

So a poor and rich of equal native ability could have drastically different scores that could lead to drastically different life outcomes.

SAT's don't measure native ability.  Their scores are generally correlated in some way with native ability, but they are not direct measurements.

This is coming from someone who lived in Southern California with one of the largest Asian communities. Back then, I thought this would be a really powerful message, an underdog role who has achieved academic success, who doesn't root for the underdog? After the deadline passed, me and my closest friends decided to pass our essays to each other (we had a no idea stealing policy before deadline), and guess what? Almost all of us had the similar story, with different variations. I considered myself an EXTREMELY good writer in high school, but now that I'm more experienced, looking back, it read like 1st world kid complaining about 1st world problems, comical if not eye-rolling. (Bonus tip, don't write about negative things that hold you back, as cheesy as it sounds, write about positive experiences that make you want to explore/tackle the world. Don't try to frame ""language and cultural barriers"" as limitations to overcome either, it'll end up sound pitiful.) 

The essay question asking you to share an experience, family history, or life event that shaped your world view is a very common one. I call it the 1st generation trap. Many of us think it's a milestone to be 1st generation to do something and will write stories about ""1st gen immigrants with language barrier"", ""1st gen US born with immigrant parents who had language barriers"", ""1st gen college student who had parents who didnt go to college"", ""1st gen US college but parents went to college overseas"" that will all end up sounding very similar. If your younger siblings are applying to Ivy league private schools, make sure they always avoid these topics. 

Edit: I was still able to get accepted by a lot of UCs, but I was top 5-10%ile in class ranking, and lived in california (paid tax for UC schools). This advice is for those applying for Ivy leagues, who are more selective, where every applicant already has over the top grades, high test scores, and a bunch of volunteer/leadership stuff. You gotta differentiate yourself from all the other Asians. ","2"

A lot of it comes down to execution [e.g., this girl's essay on the language barrier](https://thetab.com/us/2017/03/31/got-into-all-ivies-64085) and being reflective in an effective way.

As for differentiation, it's pretty notable every ivy league school's orchestra violin section is 2/3 or more asian, while asian representation is ivy league athletics is ~5% and limited to a few sports. There is significant, artificial selection in the AA applicant pool that ends up making it harder.","2_1"

It sounded powerful to myself, but with the word limits, it's too easy to sound ""*jaded*"" when you are talking about overcoming an experience or talking about how a certain experience made you a stronger person.

The essay isn't really that important. 

When Michigan tried to get around the ban on quotas by calling it 'critical mass', they assigned 20 points for race but only a few points maximum for the essay.

And, I would point out that this advice to not write about overcoming the barriers of a 1rst gen immigrant only applies to Asian American applicants.

Colleges will deny it, but they're putting a cap on the number of AA applicants so they're comparing AA applicants against each other. We saw that with the Princeton admissions officers who  were comparing applicants to other applicants in the same ethnic group- they were saying stuff like this you don't see a lot of African Americans with scores like this when deciding whether or not to admit an African American student.

Let's say there's an AA applicant who's a first generation Asian American applicant whose family doesn't speak English and who came to this country with no money on a rickety boat fleeing sharks and war. This AA applicant is the first one in his family to go to college, and his parents are low paid cooks in some asian restaurant. 

To the college admission officer, this is going to sound very similar to 
all these other AA applicants with amazing scores who also had to overcome similar obstacles.

His main piece of evidence was the lack of growth in the Asian-American population at Ivy League schools, despite the growing percentage of college-age Asians nationwide. As a counterexample, he compared Asian enrollment at these schools to Caltech, where they dont have affirmative action:


&gt;There are several flaws with this analysis. It assumes the quality of the Asian applicant pool has stayed the same as the population grows, as Poon points out.


&gt;It also only looks at how many students enroll in the school, and not how many students are admitted to the school. Jenn Fang, who writes at Reappropriate.co, found that the limited growth in Asian-Americans students at Harvard wasnt out of the ordinary:

We are being accurately represented in Ivy League admissions(NOT ENROLLMENT) in correlation to population. 

This means Asian kids are turning down offers to go to Ivy Leagues, maybe to go to a different Ivy League or another college altogether. So really, you should be just yelling at yourselves for not being able to attend multiple colleges (please dont actually do this because some kids will get guilt tripped into doing something that physically impossible because of our weird desire to overchieve while killing ourselves so we can look pretty for the community) so you can boost the AA enrollment percentages for other grumpy Asians who wouldve never made it past the interview phase and has to vicariously live through other people so they can inflate their egos and blame the system for getting rejected.

BTW, these rulings about AA specifically deal with race. Using other factors like personality tests, social factors, income, etc. all potentially impact race but according to the Supreme Court, they are all fair game.

They shouldn't have used CA, affirmative action is actually banned. CSU generally accept everyone in the surrounding community. UC limit their Asian American population unintentionally.

In addition, hypothetically in terms of number and their scale unit, UC has a quota of top 20 of each high school, that would limit Asian-American since Asian-Americans generally congregate in one area.

&gt; For Asian-Americansthe majority of whom support affirmative actionbeing cast in the foreground of the affirmative-action debate can be awkward and painful. Affirmative action has consistently been a wedge issue, and groups such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice have opposed attempts to use Asian students as the wedge in conservative attacks on affirmative action that may harm black and Latino students. Some simply deny that race-conscious admissions procedures are disadvantaging Asians at all, which avoids confronting a complicated dilemma.

Imho, it's not obvious that it's actually a ""majority,"" but I agree strongly with the last sentence.

Affirmative action is essential to prevent de facto racial segregation in higher education because higher education is essential not only in laying the groundwork for future professional networks, but in providing a potential forum for people to critically engage in discussions regarding race. Discussions about race rarely happen at any earlier part of education (and if they do, they're often shallow discussions), and given the self-segregation of people across information sources, the internet/media is not going to solve this issue either.

To be a MD, it really doesn't really matter what color you are as long as you can do the job correctly, and that being said the job isn't deserving to those who got a free boost due to the color of their skin and that is what I truly recognize as a privilege.

I came here in middle school (presumably around the same age as you). My mother is a RN just like yours. Unlike you, I spoke English well before coming here but other than that we have similar backgrounds if we're disregarding class background. 

Why are Asians the ones that ""actually made it""? Is this even a valid question to make when it's devoid of so much context? Let's take our cases. Our mothers both went to college and graduated with a degree. My father also went to college and graduated with a 4 year degree. 

That already creates an advantage. Parents with degrees often send their kids to college, and their kids are usually successful in gaining equivalent or higher levels of secondary education. University educated adults, immigrants or not, know the value of an education, and will plan for their kids' futures with that in mind. 

Just the education causes a massive gap. Why? Because it changes the environment you grow up in. Parents with degrees usually make more money than uneducated adults. They're more likely to have a smaller family which means they can spend more on each kid. They're going to be less likely to work multiple part time jobs. Their children are less likely to be forced to work to support the family. They will be more likely to live in a normal to nice neighbourhood. 

This is only going into the material differences that a college degree gives. 

The intangibles? 

Educated adults have higher expectations of their kids. They're more likely to instill a sense of social mobility than a kid that grows up poor. As immigrants our parents probably gave up a better life back home to move downwards; this downwards social mobility gives them an incentive to push their kids towards a ""better life."" Etc. etc. 

This is all motivation and physical resources that is not present for any kid growing up in the inner city. This is all without going into the systems of racial and ethnic oppression in the United States that further disadvantages minorities in physical, psychological, and sociological ways. 

""Asians"" made it in this country because the US immigration system favours highly educated, upper middle class Asian families with established ties in the US. They have degrees. They have avenues of employment. They have family or employers who vouch for them through the immigration process and ease them through naturalization. 

What happens when you remove that? What happens when we look at the Asians that fall through the cracks? 

Refugees from Southeast Asia do not ""make it."" They have those large dropout rates for black and Latino students. They have crushing levels of poverty. And they're currently in need of being admitted into the *exact* program that you want to abolish. 

Instead of whining about how it's unfair towards Asians and trying to abolish it, work towards increasing the effects of the law and undoing the injustice currently being carried out against our community because ""Asian"" is so large that it completely destroys any conversations about the education inequality in our community.

 If anything the ""racist"" policy you should be targeting is the legacy system which allows ""undeserving"" whites who have lower scores, lower GPA's and worse applications into schools merely because their father, and their grandfather, and their mother went to this school or that school. Those are the spots that are taking away from your precious admissions. Not the ones intended for minorities. ","4_2_1_1"

I agree with your overall point that we shouldn't be fighting affirmative action. If anything, we should be fighting legacy admissions, the deployment of ""leadership"" qualities against Asian applicants by admissions boards in a repeat of the tactics used by anti-Semites earlier in the 20th century, and the aggregation of Asians into a bloc that robs Southeast Asians of needed opportunities through affirmative action.

That said, not to split hairs, but this particular narrative does bother me. It's not quite that simple. Chinese and Japanese families' fortunes started picking up before the wave of educated East Asian immigration from the 60s and 70s, and it was a combination of the efforts of the Asian community leaders here and the geopolitical needs of the US in East Asia that set the stage for the fortunes of Asian-Americans to improve. I actually think it's valuable to look at the perception of Chinese in particular during the era of the Chinese Exclusion Act, before that skilled immigration wave, to understand why we shouldn't necessarily be hostile to affirmative action--we were definitely NOT always the model minority, which is clear just looking at a typical early 20th century drawing of Chinatown by a white artist.","4_2_1_1_1"

The studies I've seen still show overwhelming support for race-based affirmative action among Asian Americans. [Take a look at Q16A in this survey published in September](https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/aavs2020_crosstab_national.html), which shows about 70% of Asian Americans support affirmative action while 16% oppose.

From what I can tell, a lot of the right-of-center Asian voters (especially a lot of the Republican Vietnamese Americans I know) are motivated by issues like taxes, fear of socialism, and outright hostility towards black people. Taking Affirmative Action off the table isn't going to persuade them.

The author of the linked article boldly purports to speak for all Asians as a single-minded group of voters, all with the same opinion:

&gt; Asian-Americans, especially Chinese-Americans, hate race-based affirmative action in education that systematically discriminates against the admission of their children. 

&gt; Chinese-Americans view these actions as an assault on their cultural values, with a firm belief in competition, individual accomplishments and meritocracy, that is distinctly conservative.  

&gt; In addition to the Democratic Partys push for affirmative action, Chinese-Americans are also wary of what they perceive as creeping communist ideas in the liberal left.

You cant deny affirmative action isnt racism against Asians. Were consistently held to a higher standard than any other group.

You can say so. But I'm guessing you wouldn't purport to speak for all Asians on this issue. You'd know better than to make claims for all Asians, because there is a diversity of opinion on the policy.

&gt; I believe 100% AA will hurt the opportunities of my children.

And you can believe that, while I'll personally disagree. I don't believe it's a significant factor, at least as compared to issues like legacy/donor admissions, systemic bias regarding soft factors in admissions (the types of extracurriculars that admissions officials like or don't like, intangibles like leadership and commitment to public service), and the significant difference in outcomes for Asians in the workforce as compared to similarly educated whites.

In other words, the bias against Asians primarily happens after they're already admitted, and long after they've graduated. Moving the students ""up"" a school or two in the rankings isn't going to address the elephant in the room, and what I think the focus should primarily be on.","2_2_1_1_1"

But schools explicitly prohibited from considering race in admissions still engage in that kind of soft discrimination in Asians, and I'm arguing the effect is actually stronger than race-conscious affirmative action as practiced. So by lumping in the real problem with ""affirmative action,"" you're focusing your attention on the type of discrimination that is a smaller magnitude.

And all this is a distraction from my point: you can disagree with me on whether affirmative action actually hurts Asians on balance, or whether it's bad for society. That's fine. What's not fine is purporting to speak for me on the issue, by lumping all Asians into one group and saying that they feel this way about the issue, when speaking to a conservative audience of non-Asians.","2_2_1_1_1_1_1"

Because none to few of the asian harvard students are making this argument because they want to have their kids to benefit from the same legacy system and reap the rewards of generational oligarchy like white folks do. There's an incentive for asian students to defend Harvard's discriminatory practice because they don't want to rock the boat and perhaps harvard decides that their children shouldn't reap the same rewards as well.

Or what about rappers write songs glorifying committing crimes against asians.  Where was the national outrage? Or the recent black on asian vioence that's been happening in NYC?

Outrage is certainly not from wealthy liberal asians who think asians are privileged (even these poor 1st gen FOBs) and black folks get a pass because they're lower on the oppression scale.  The dirty little secret, of course, is that wealthy progressive 2nd/3rd/4th etc. gen asians look down on 1st gen asians.  There's never national outrage when asians face any sort of discrimination.

Asians are always asked to sacrifice themselves for the greater good and abuses against asians, whether from systemic racism from whites or from other minorities are ignored.  You're asking a group of people who have 0 political power or influence to sacrifice for others FIRST.

Here's how the Asian American members of the state assembly voted (may be incomplete). Basically the vote was along party lines.

Yeas:

* Rob Bonta (D-Alameda)

* David Chiu (D-San Francisco)

* Todd Gloria (D-San Diego)

* Ash Kalra (D-San Jose)

* Evan Low (D-Campbell)

* Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance)

* Phil Ting (D-San Francisco)

Nays:

* Phillip Chen (R-Yorba Linda)

* Steven Choi (R-Irvine)

* Tyler Diep (R-Westminster)

* Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield)

Did not vote:

* Ed Chau (D-Arcadia)

* Kansen Chu (D-San Jose)

As the below excerpt shows, there was not the same organized opposition by Asian legislators this time around:

&gt; The act of giving special or preferential treatment to someone based on their race is racism itself, or on sex is sexism, said Assemblyman Steven Choi, R-Irvine. Just ask yourself, is it right to give someone a job just because they are white or black or green or yellow? Or just because they are male?

&gt; The Legislature last took up the issue in 2014, when the state Senate passed a proposed constitutional amendment that would have asked voters to reverse the ban on consideration of race and sex in college admissions. The Assembly shelved the measure after Asian Americans said it could limit their childrens ability to get into Californias most selective public universities, where Asian Americans make up a greater share of students than in the overall population.

&gt; That tension was laid bare again Wednesday. Several Asian American legislators who ultimately voted for the measure said proponents of bringing back affirmative action had not done enough outreach to their community. They said many of their constituents fear a repeal of Prop. 209 would undo gains they have worked hard to achieve.

&gt; Asian Americans, just like everyone else, we are seeking equal opportunity. We want to be treated fairly, said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance (Los Angeles County).

&gt; Assemblyman Evan Low, D-Campbell, said his office had received more than 3,000 calls from constituents who opposed ACA5 and only 99 from people who supported it. He raised the possibility that his vote could cost him his seat, adding that he had heard from elected officials in his district who asked him, Arent you yellow? Why are you voting against your own people?

Low's vote is basically a Principal Skinner ""[Am I so out of touch? It's them who are wrong](https://youtube.com/watch?v=HMqZ2PPOLik)"" moment.

Here's another Democrat trying to have it both ways:

&gt; Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, D-San Diego, credited affirmative action for her admission to Stanford University and a masters program at Georgetown University. In school, she said, teachers had lower expectations for her than her white peers.

&gt; We cant create colorblindness, and it doesnt exist, she said.

Isn't the soft bigotry of low expectations a *result* of affirmative action or diversity admissions/hires?

Ultimately, is the choice really a binary between ""me first"" vs. ""the greater good"" when it comes to Asian Americans and affirmative action?

To insert my personal experience: I was rejected from three UCs (Davis, Irvine, and San Diego) with a B average, 2000s SAT, and minimal extracurricular activities when I applied in 2008. So I doubt that I would've gotten in without Prop 209.","1"

I think the pros are slight, while the cons can be very damaging. I think prop 209 should stay.

All the criticisms and support for affirmative action are borne out to some extent in other countries, although affirmative action looks very different in other countries because of different group histories, policies, and implementations. 

[main source for stuff I'm saying](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-01/does-affirmative-action-work)

For example, can it increase bigotry? Yes; in Malaysia, affirmative actions for Malays (who were disadvantaged compared to Chinese and Indians in Malaysia) led to a ""hyperconsciousness of ethnicity."" Chinese and Malay institutions regularly segregated themselves by race as recently as 2010.

Can it benefit all citizens? Economically, Malaysia's GDP increased steadily from 1970 (a year before the affirmative action law was enacted) to 2015 (when my referenced article was published). So at least in terms of economics, it doesn't seem to have *hurt.*

Sometimes it can *aid* minorities in poverty (not by itself do enough to lift them out of it), while other times, it is corrupted and abused by rich minorities to retain wealth among themselves. This is shown in scandals in India and Malaysia. In South Africa, the first attempt at affirmative action just spread wealth among black entrepreneurs, not trickling down to workers. The second attempt in 2003, which targeted the education and promotion of black workers, reduced black poverty by 15% by 2015, although the total rate was still over 50%.

Something to be clear of though: Advocates for affirmative action, especially for college admissions, are deceived if they think it doesn't hurt Asians. There is a finite amount of spots in a college. If more people of one race get it, fewer of others get it. That is a fact. The catch is this: I read once from a study, that it actually only *barely* hurts Asians, at least at Ivy Leagues, since there are so few black and Latino people applying. The study said something like Asians' chance of acceptance only dropped by 1% or something.

Despite all this, no one can be *sure* of what would happen with affirmative action in California--how it might be structured, and what would come of that. Even if we admitted more black students, they could just hang out in black clubs, and whites would talk to whites, etc. Their wealth might not spread to the poor black neighborhoods. Racial tensions could escalate. Or maybe affirmative action could help, at least a little, but not fix poverty rates among minorities. 

My opinion is, it seems that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. I think prop 209 should stay.","1_1"

Yet in that same election day, [53% voted to uphold the death penalty](http://web.archive.org/web/20161202002654/http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/ballot-measures/). California may strongly prefer Democrats for president and governor, but don't count on them to vote for every left wing cause.

Also, are there legitimate cases of Prop 209 causing well qualified black or Hispanic applicants to be rejected from colleges, state jobs, or government contracts in California? I would expect the 209 opponents to have at least *some* anecdotal evidence, rather than merely pointing at UC enrollment numbers (regardless of the fact that [black and Hispanic graduation rates went up after 209](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~psarcidi/prop209.pdf)).

Ultimately, it boils down to what's the most ethical, logical choice. Let's say this initiative does make it to the ballot. Would an Asian American parent potentially vote to reduce their kid's chance at getting in a UC in the name of the ""greater good"" of diversity? Did 209 prove that a meritocracy *can* also be diverse?

As it exists now, AA is more or less a carte blanche given to admissions offices to set up artificial quotas on how many and what kind of person to admit. The statistics have been posted here ad nauseam, but it bears repeating that when AA is implemented in the American college system, it expands enrollment for African Americans, non-white Hispanics, and other groups, lowers admissions for Asian Americans, but leaves white admissions more or less untouched.

Others have suggested this before, but if we're sincerely going to pursue AA as a way to address historical injustices and promote education among underrepresented minorities, then the group most aggressively seeking to implement AA, and who are most responsible for those same historical injustices, ought to bear some of the burden of advancing opportunities to underrepresented minorities.

In the 2A world we've been noticing that with the declining to review Jackson, rejecting the NRA appeal to overturn California's storage laws and hollowpoint ban, and the 4th District's decision on AR-15 being allowed to stand; that and more undermining what was found in Heller.","3"

The Free Harvard/Fair Harvard group is campaigning for more transparency in the admissions process and to end discrimination on the basis of race. They want to make Harvard free so that those of low income are more able to attend the institution, and strongly support consideration for poverty and less privileged backgrounds, which is exactly what affirmative action crudely tries to accomplish.

&gt;**Myth #1: Affirmative action discriminates against Asians.**

&gt;Asians aren't victims of affirmative action programs. Studies have shown that AAPIs are harmed by ""negative action,"" which is not the same as affirmative action. Negative action is when AAPIs are held to a higher standard than Caucasians, without any legitimate reason.

What does the author think causes ""negative action""? It's simple math. If you add, artificially, to column A, you have to remove, artificially, from column B. And how do you do this? By holding column B to a higher standard.

&gt;Opponents of affirmative action ignore history when they claim that Asians have been harmed by affirmative action in higher education.

I'm not sure anyone says this. The question is whether it harms Asians *now* - not in the 60s or 70s. I'm not sure that any argument against affirmative action is based on harm to Asians half a century ago.

&gt;Opponents of affirmative action also argue that considering race compromises merit. But merit comes in many forms and grades and test scores aren't everything.

Race, on the other hand, is all about merit.

&gt;**Myth #2: Affirmative action doesn't benefit Asian Americans.**

&gt;AAPIs and all students benefit from being educated in diverse learning environments, which affirmative action programs help create. AAPIs are harmed when they attend schools that are less racially diverse and more segregated.

*...how?* This is so unbelievably paternalistic. ""What you want is not important. You *need* diversity, and we need to look out for *your* best interests by providing you with that diversity.

&gt;**Myth #3: We live in a colorblind society and no longer need affirmative action.**

Said no one (of any relevance) ever.

&gt;**Myth #4: Affirmative action helped Asian Americans in the past, but now Asian Americans don't need it.**

She then proceeds to concur with this ""myth,"" instead offering that we cannot ""only support programs when they benefit us."" I happen to agree. However, even if Asian Americans still ""need[ed]"" affirmative action, the simple fact of the matter is that affirmative action, in its present incarnation, discriminates *against* Asian Americans, so the argument is moot.

&gt;**Myth #5: Asians support the end of affirmative action.**

I think it goes both ways. Asians are individuals, not some sort of monolith that supports one thing or another.

&gt;**So Asians, please don't hate on affirmative action. It does our society good!**

I think so too! But that was not the premise of the article at all! Don't argue that affirmative action (1) does not harm and (2) in fact helps Asians out of one side of your mouth, and then proceed to argue out of the other side of your mouth that although affirmative action (1) harms and (2) does not help Asians, it does society as a whole more good than harm. I agree with the latter argument. However, I just lose it when people try to argue it both ways, as here. It's intellectually dishonest, and intellectually lacking.

I am embarrassed that the author is an attorney.","1"

It really depends on what program you're looking at. In the most recent case, [Fisher v. UT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_v._University_of_Texas), the Court dealt w/ a system that didn't consider Asian Americans as a minority race. This is, as I believe, due to the fact of racial balancing, i.e., looking at the race of Asian Americans in the school and matching that w/ the population of Asian Americans in Texas. (Note: This is my belief, but the Court has said that racial balancing may be unconstitutional. [See Parents Involved](http://www.oyez.org/cases/2000-2009/2006/2006_05_908)). That being said, one of the requirements the Court has stated is that there needs to be reviews of whether or not to implement Affirmative Action programs. I believe in the UT case it was five years. So where am I going at with this? Asian American may not benefit from Affirmative Action in the UT case, but I'm sure at other schools where there are few Asian Americans, affirmative action actually helps them. Again, it depends on which program you look at.
